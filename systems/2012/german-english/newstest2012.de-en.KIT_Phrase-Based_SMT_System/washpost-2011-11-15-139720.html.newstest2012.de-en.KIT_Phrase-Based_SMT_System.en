Troops feel more sympathy than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans collected in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A key word collected themselves hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
"The servicemen and women were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising effort in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, among other things, the chief of staff and former chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, the role of the troops.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure the organizers have meant well.
I know that.
But there was no respect, not really, it was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, service members.
The public is increasingly than do people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigadier general Sean B. MacFarland, who commands the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But, apparently, is the only way of support is in the role of the unfortunate souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who do not want ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also realised that the anger, the returning troops over the last few years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result there are discussions about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned with the marines from battles, warned Colonel rancorous Mark Cancian, they could see that people outside the military world services from two different perspectives.
Some of them would look with a feeling of awe, as they defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether an "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface lies," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and highlighted government posts in Washington has taken on his return.
During his job search, he said, he sensed that some of the interviewers they subtly, whether he is capable of immediately after his return from the struggle to withstand the pressure of a challenging post in Washington.
"If you are talking about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian said his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in the lack of interest by the Americans in the war.
Services will be on the battlefield by a country that has little experience with the military and provides little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely as praise.
"We as a nation, not military heroism, as it was in the Second World War was absolutely normal," said Lieutenant General David Barno rancorous, command of US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely on the suffering of a family service.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost them, or for the severity of their injuries.
