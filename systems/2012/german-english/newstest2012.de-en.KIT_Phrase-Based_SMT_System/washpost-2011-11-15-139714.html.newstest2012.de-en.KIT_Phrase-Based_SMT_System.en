Mission ended, Congress is ready to agree on Libya
It looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington to communicate about the uprisings in Libya.
What was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending the American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee for international relations of the Senate resolution, which commends Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), with Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, which began with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"It is a reaffirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers squabbled both parties and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions on the approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya mission to NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain approved a resolution to the limited use of military force by the United States in Libya.
The law was thrown out by a broad fringe of both parties in the Senate, and there was no vote.
But fell on the same day, this bill in the Senate by also outvoted the chamber of a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
The US mission ran into a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress, which was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach in the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to definitively the rug from under our feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate is perhaps ready for action.
The resolution of the committee for international relations, "congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and extraordinary stamina in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners, the support of the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy."
The new measures will receive the full support of the body for foreign relations or they will divide the legislators, as it has done the law in June?
The latest version of resistance on the part of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana polis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that the final version of the new law have not yet seen.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional term, Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, under the leadership of the Republican Bob Good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area at the time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried, unsuccessfully, to bring their amendments to the vote, although they often enough.
Lattes good change is just one of 68 constitutional changes, which were presented to the congress and include a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to the Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions in the Senate, the compensatory budget amendment and another dozen "controlling federal spending."
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - especially starters with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have such a measure '. "
The Haushaltskontrollgesetz, which was adopted in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget is balanced.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such an amendment.
The budget also want to lift some members, the number of the provisions, the members of Congress can present limit, while the Republicans Jos√© E. Serrano (New York), the limit of two terms of office of the president.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes which, among other things, the right to a good education and health care.
An amendment, which prohibits marriage among sex, as well as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurrent presentation.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the lifting of federal laws, if two-thirds of the states they reject.
So keen to propose changes to the members, so unequal to move faster, as in the past few years.
In 111. Congress showed 77 legislators vor. such changes in the 110 Congress 66th.
The pace pales in comparison to the early 1990s, in which more than 150 amendments members regularly proposed every two years, the figures, which the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last change, which is to add - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually already proposed to Congress in 1789.
