The court approved for 2015, the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of the analogue to digital signals in the last few years, the world's most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints must be brought forward by the Senate and House against the presidential decree and by virtue of the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to a lack of eight votes needed for legislative challenge.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza was the view of the president, Felipe Calderón, have not exceeded his powers when he described the decree law with the details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television.
This decision was rejected by the Senate launched constitutional dispute, since he received the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court should decide on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality; the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, which was drafted by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, has been proposed to explain the decree law unconstitutional because, for the radio and television concerned the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Telecommunications Commission in Mexico) is responsible, which is why the decree law reserved for the hierarchical principles and the law would contradict.
Voted in favor of the project only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies constitutional complaints against the decree law. After the adoption of the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero said the decree law no longer and all activities to create the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, which is also the Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister, not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the government of countries with general rules, the measures should take the public administration, should regulate.
"I do not believe that, if we do that, it would impair the independence of the regulator." She also recalled that the strategic planning policy areas, such as the sector of telecommunications, for constitutional reasons, the central state government, since it leads the state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals through digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years throughout the world, and it leads to a better use of the radio-electric spectrum, increasing the quality of the signal and more channels.
Delaying the switch, she said, was a beneficiary of the digitisation, which have a decision in the public interest, not just the technical aspects, "because they include economic, social, political and technical aspects of security."
These matters, she emphasized, "the action of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state, they included a group of characteristics in the hands of the central state government."
She called that many countries around the world, the digital conversion had already been carried out, and the government, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
We could not conclude that the government, with the publication of the contested law decree to intervene in the powers of Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected, " she assured.
