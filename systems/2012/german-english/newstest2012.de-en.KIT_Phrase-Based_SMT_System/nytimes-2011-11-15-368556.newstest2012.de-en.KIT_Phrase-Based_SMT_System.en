The carers union will lodge a complaint against the city because of layoffs
The union, hundreds of workers last month, have lost their jobs, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the layoffs because of their disproportionate influence on the schools, which teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last chance of the union local council, 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies, is still open.
Sechshundert seventy-two school helpers, care coordinators and other staff who had been among the lowest paid employees of the city, and on October 7, in a move that lost their jobs, the union leaders described as a political revenge for that in the past year, the city's access to a health fund, the working groups, had denied the budget gap should be closed.
This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools in the last month, the redundancies were part of the budget that passed in June.
A town council member shot back and said that the budget would not specify that the school aid will be made redundant.
Officials from the City Council 37 said they have warned the Ministry of Education in a complaint, and it will give a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan, formally announced on Wednesday.
Mr. Walcott the complaint and the Ministry of Education as a defendant in the city and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of which are coloured or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said the city would not be the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft complaint, the New York Times, the union has lost to the number of redundancies in schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city, focused a complaint for discrimination to support claims that poor schools, more aid workers, because they are chronically underfunded.
It points out that, while there was no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 schools in Brown's Ville, Brooklyn, and have lost 46 helpers in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South bronx were made redundant in the district of 23.
With the loss of five of eight school volunteers, who were in the public school, 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "this is not a wealthy few neighborhood parents can organise donations to offset budget cuts."
P.S.: the budget of the 36th southern this year has been cut by 3.26 per cent, and also lost money, the city of their calculation method for the extra funding for any Armenschuleneinschreibung changed.
The union also complained that the heads of the high schools were led by the language in a memo, which approved the dismissal of care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the United States usually exchange a teacher from the payroll describes a school in a pool of available workers, who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty six care coordinators were sacked, not transferred," the complaint says.
