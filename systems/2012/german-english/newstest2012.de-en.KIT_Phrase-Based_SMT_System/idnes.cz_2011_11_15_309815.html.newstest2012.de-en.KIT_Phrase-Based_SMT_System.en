Experts say a Stylist - must be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn Stylisten, I had a bit of gemeckert that it was a bit too much for the beginning.
As I suspected, not in the least, which is yet to come.
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how the "place."
It is worse to come.
The closer we get to the examination, more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course every Saturday and Sunday will take place, it is full.
This time we debated attracts with director Alena (the rate is not a single man), as a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.
And these are, after all, most of us.
Have a short neck, the other a young best figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter for the Stylisten to extend broad shoulders looks to conceal the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves.
We also got clues to how Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - with great, wide hip and pretty thin waists and attracts figure stresses that it is too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waists and waists is so great that the skirt or trousers really does not fit, you should at least cut a measure.
It will certainly not repent, because well-seated clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in a bar, constantly high and verrutscht in absteht waists, etc.
Boys, formulaic characters, in turn, can afford to wear clothing with wrinkles, Bausch, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
This quantity of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week for me to go through the head.
And yet, I am afraid that it is almost impossible to achieve, given the assigned homework.
Each of the rate of domestic participants got a celebrity, for which they devise suitable Outfits - day clothes and evening wardrobe.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of stars and Figurtyp.
I should attract Miranda Kerr ,"" you may be out of the campaign, Victoria's Secret.
Inside, I juble, because it is much better for me personally, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has grown in recent times, the hundred kilos (okay, that is a bit exaggerated, or even the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes we are supposed to consider reprinting from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, and then telegraphically.
" In the Mood Board, the result is known, then our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.
The Stylist the models not only physically, but also the so-called product page in the magazine (concrete target, for example, trend-handbags, coats, etc.).
This told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist must have a good overview.
With information on the types of characters filled Saturday lecture has been seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
The Pokorný Stylisten Jan, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to exploit it.
And eingeschickter Stylist with a single piece of clothing to work in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
You can, for example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but also on the naked body, paragraph shoes can attract and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up our sleeves or collar and the whole look is quite different.
"To play," he said.
Most came but I want the following advice: "first you need to know what the rules are perfect."
"Only then can they violate," said Jakub.
At last, it is clear to me why we pauken all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if in fashion journals are often very different to see.
A look of fashion.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a Stylist clothing options much more prepared than he ultimately photographed.
We therefore need to be prepared for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten Outfits) to stylen at least 15.
And also that the clothing on the photograph, in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
With all that we must therefore expect the shaping of the Outfits.
That image and sometimes Styl account for half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
Since you need only Madonna, not brilliant singer from the image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic is one of the services of a Stylisten rather reserved.
Well-known personalities, it is often wasted money (the main thing is that I am, how I turned out secondary).
And if anyone stylen from us, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to be a very different (smaller) imposing size when he or she needs in reality.
Then we need then to googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press, the celebrity was again or fallen, etc.
Jan and Mario on Sunday to believe that a Stylist only to focus on fashion and clothes, "assemble" needs.
In his work, above all, he must communicate with the people, he stylt and he must be a psychologist.
Assess people without curry and his opinion.
"If any manager, in order to supplement their clothes cupboard to sift through and beautiful pieces, then we can't eliminate the entire wardrobe and say - my God, this is terrible."
"We must find at least a few worthy, which recommends what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what needs to be a so-called "pocket."
So a bag in the zuknöpft waists and in all the necessary Proprietäten in.
No such clear, such as scissors, Abroller to remove hair or safety needles, it also contains such Utensilien a nylon thread (the Stylist helps the photographing of products, such as handbags or hats), specific clips with the clothes will be killed if they are too big (outlets needles or other crunch banned the substance, not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.
But we must not only listen, but also can try something practical, we learned how to properly unterklebt shoes.
The photography in the Atelier, where the floor you can damage the shoe bottom, let alone the outside.
O screwed us and we screwed...
With the gap should not affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.
So you really have to proceed.
Mario enjoyed, he praised my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill is not my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we hear on the second weekend serial course.
One thing is now clear to me - to devote Styling at professional level, there is no pushover.
