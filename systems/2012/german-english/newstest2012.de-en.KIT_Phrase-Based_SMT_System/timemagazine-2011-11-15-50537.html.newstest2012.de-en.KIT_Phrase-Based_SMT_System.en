Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik, only one of many boys, their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, had Breivik has confessed to a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, its first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik acted alone, it is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack before his computer, and with some of the millions of gechattet nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, wanted more researchers to find out about these people.
But, as we find them?
It is easy - you only have to connect to Facebook.
"We have noticed that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British ideas factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Face Books hide personal data is enzyklop√§disch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply use the advertising tool alongside their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific precision, as do retailers for years.
Bartletts team held a half-million fans of extreme-right groups in Europe and reshaped it with Adds to connect, but instead with a new band or a new diet product, Adds invited users to a poll in which their education, their attitude towards violence and was asked to assess their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - that they just have to leave their office.
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly come as a surprise, online promoter of extreme-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of distortion, surprisingly, are those who combine their online activism with offline activism more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens. "
DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook will become a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends, such as ' Likes ' text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, on average, add three content per day, Face Books generates data supernova explosion, " a research boom, the number of scientific work by the name of this side in the title of almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that you can study this side of people not normally with his Clipboard on the street.
"If you previously tried to interview people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first inform the party and they would never have access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who drink their full binge on Facebook, significantly more problem than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno proposes that equal students, for example, residential advisers to monitor and help a student if they have too many post status updates.
"They can't solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-writer and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also zapft the data to his own people.
The data team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (primarily used data on the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long known that the side of their great data treasure trove for other research purposes.) 
But the Facebook users know that the side they watched, whether or not they now want to be able to play with a friend, thousands of miles away, Scrabble sown, allows for the side's own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook will be part of a survey that they do not even know something?
While researchers have strict guidelines laid down their offline data collection is online.
"I do not believe that many users have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab, a study in 2006, in which he studied the public side of students on Facebook.
"What they are concerned, it was all about them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
It is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile, and contributions are true on Facebook.
"What we say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two entirely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as a technology researchers that Clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tool, anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for the real world and to speak with real people," he says.
"Social research must look at the social - and a lot of social life is still offline."
