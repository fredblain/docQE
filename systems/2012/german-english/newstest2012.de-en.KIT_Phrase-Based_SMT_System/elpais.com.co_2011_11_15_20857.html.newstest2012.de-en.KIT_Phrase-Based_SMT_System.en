The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street demanded this Tuesday, the New York authorities, as they sought a court order to enter the Manhatten Square after they cleared the room at dawn and had tried to occupy a different place in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed the Zuccotti Square, with a court order, "outraged" allowed to gain access to new tents at this point, while another part of the movement's eviction orders and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to campen on the square, we come together in a different place, and the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti continue with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the movement, "Ocupy Wall Street."
Bray said that the response of the " outraged " at the evacuation of their tent camp directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, until it came before the court, where the judge " Lucy Billings a kindred order forbade the forced evacuation of the place and the demonstrators approved the tents.
Moreover, the occupied "outraged," a new park, which is at the crossroads of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, the New York and New Jersey links, and the property of the Trinity Church.

The judicial order prohibits the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street, as well as the application of laws, which were adopted after the occupation and to prohibit the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had previously used to go back into the park. "
Mayor Bloomberg is clear before the press, which had been due to this court warrant the re-opening of the square for the public and the protesters lifted the demonstrators, he pointed out that the city laws, they are not allowed to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor defended personally carried out at dawn evacuation of the Zuccotti-Platz, nearly 200 people were arrested and it was decided, because the demonstrators ' contravened the law. "
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to the evacuation of the job because he had turned into a place where people were not Demonstrieren, but to break the law and, in some cases, other people to harm, " because " some shops have received threats, " and the residents began to worry " about their quality of life. "
"The evacuation at dawn was sickening and shows that Bloomberg is basically on the protection of financial interests and is not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, the mayor anschuldigte "not to respect the freedom of the press."
The Occupy Wall Street, that they thought about it, "major actions" to organise for Thursday, together with community organizations and unions, the two months now, to commemorate the protests since 17 September.
