Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous Peter Englunds begins new book, "beauty and a history of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates," with a long list of the main people to heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: you are mentioning this cautious side and you make it to your readers.
They will be deprived of these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative get to know each other very well, and these people are your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments, in which you Englunds men and women in the fog of war and your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he is not incorrect as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little ambassadors, racing reporter or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and sentiments."
"Beauty and horror" almost 20 war experience of more or less innocuous men and women on both sides of the war of school girls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some prisoners of war, losing limb, crazy or die.
Each of these lives come as the Votivkerzen in a church, some added, while others fade away.
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrected the idea of the First World War was just devastating positions of war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" ends with a view of experts on other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse fly an intractable problem.
This is almost from the outset, a very moving book.
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, reeks of Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who stay at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance. You or you take the flight?
Anyone at all?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war at all.
"The lack of facts," Englund says, "have been improved with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and horror" individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army and Richard root, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other published material.
Their reports can be frightening or simple, but they are very much alive in the Englunds depreciating accumulation in details of small moments.
Many of them act of shortages and bush redress.
In the history of a German school girl, he told: "spare everywhere."
"Spare coffee, wrong aluminium, false Radiergummi, paper associations, wood buttons."
He told the dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and cooked in Hammelfett (and most recently served with a false bone from wood), tobacco, made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes, besohlt timber."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food replacement funds were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511; registered coffee substitute."
Some stories of honor and bravery.
An American who recognizes his own drive for the game and says about the war: "one feels that, despite everything, that is what it was for men to sit in Lehnstuhl to do with the evening tide or bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky, and so is such a fa√ßade of civilisation and there would be no barbarism behind its own strengthened and literate breast shirt."
Conversely, a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and nobody notice or care.
"If you would like the idea of self-sacrifice, we think that this is happening in front of a crowd," he writes.
Instead, it is terrible how "a convicted man was hanged in secret."
Other observations of the old Europe fall apart, and on new types of terror.
"The conflict has been a growing economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the young century": "the eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick of the slaughter, while he sits behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways and there are equally frivolous behavior, such as Heroismus.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute infected with a sexually transmitted disease, in order to escape the front.
"The grotesque expression can be discovered in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, bought for soldiers and their genitals, greased hoping to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those were really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is elastic and unintrusive and fits perfectly with its human task.
In dozens of small scenes he unleashed the way, as the war "in a unique way of uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders for fighting.
The best books about the First World War were distorted, rather like Paul Fussell ' Great War and Modern Memory, " or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques " in the West is nothing new, " as the extensive history books.
Englunds band enters an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end, I have read in a factual book.
I admit it.
But it is as if he is with his book this side of the main people weggeschnappt nose and lit with a wave of wood.
