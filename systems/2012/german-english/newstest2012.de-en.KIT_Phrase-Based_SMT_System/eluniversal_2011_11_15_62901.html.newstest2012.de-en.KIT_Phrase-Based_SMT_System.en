Asphalt prevented the UNAM potholes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican University UNAM developed with Polymeren modified asphalt, in order to make the mixture resilient to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
That would avoid the sign by the road surface, respected, it would not be necessary, almost 200000 potholes to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (town area of the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the Asphaltbelags adequately happen, the number of potholes to significantly reduce or even fully.
In his lecture, "potholes from a technical point of view," he felt during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible Polymeren modified asphalt is developing a similar asphalt mix, but a major mechanical resistance in both high as low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climate, such as, for example, in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes.
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a hydrocarbon link, part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene together they give the road surface to be typical zähelastisches behavior.
Zähelastisches behavior Asphalts means that this is behaving at high temperatures of nearly 180 degrees as a liquid, it is very zähflüssig 120 degrees and 50 degrees almost, while he is crumbling at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not a uniform, but in a day, depending on the changing weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer.
The researchers said the FQ, the streets of Mexico City have been mostly a flexible road surface from six layers of material, which included the last three asphalt.
Between the upper classes is a layer of decay from asphalt from small, profusely in asphalt and entrenched stones.
Each individual piece, this decay, was profusely in asphalt.
If the vehicles to move and forces produced this class is a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it would be modified asphalt, the forces would be even better," said the chemical engineer.
" The erosion, " he said, " will be interpreted in a final layer of the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, from sand, was also in asphalt.
Since these shifts in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need more mechanical than the class decay and friction.
The road surface which receives most of the forces and distributed Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it needs to be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are more important to take into account factors, especially the water, "he said," because it affects the behavior of the class decay.
If the terrain is damp, water in the class and only difficult from this causes a relaxation of all sections of the road surface and, as a result, the incidence of stroke holes.
If a pothole, " he said, " first-class deck dismantled brick-by-brick, while the class wear only affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that should be the first sign by adequate maintenance programs maintained. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Mexico's research system) declared that the burden of the vehicle, another important reason for the emergence of blow holes so the thickness of each layer of the surface always stand in relation to the vehicle and it must be ensured that to prevent frequent blow holes this rule will be met.
Rafael Herrera has pointed out that there is still much research to wait, for example, Asphaltemulsionen in other countries are already on the market, and the potholes and repair the application of high temperatures.
