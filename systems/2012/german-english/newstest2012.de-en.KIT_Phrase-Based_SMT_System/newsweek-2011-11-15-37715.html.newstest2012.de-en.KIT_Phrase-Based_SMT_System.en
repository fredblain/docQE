The military is under growing pressure to in rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 men and women because of non-intervention in a rape to be charged before the military court.
It should not have hundreds of plaintiffs for the next hearing.
Who Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week than at night by a fellow soldier was raped.
It was back in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleague 12er Pack beer in.
He asked whether he is likely to have a drink in her room.
"My alarm went," Lyman said.
But the Texanerin dismissed their concerns.
I thought: ' Oh, he is 19.
He is from Texas, " she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feelings."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and raped, she said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman waiting and 27 other current and former military employees have a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will be decided whether a lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld are not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., included the complaint initially 17 plaintiffs, but the increases in the following months, 28: 25 women and three men, who all claim that they were raped by soldiers colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks to provide.
Burke says it is monitoring the top military leadership, because the problem is where to begin.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation of the leadership."
Burke also says that she has been in contact since February, almost 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future claims.
Their strategy: instead of all claimants were laying their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints in order to keep up the pressure.
The team of defending for the Defense Ministry, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has made a request for legal action.
The files of the court, Newsweek, lead the defense strategy, first and foremost, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for violations in the armed forces.
Because of a law to the Supreme Court from 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is liable for violations that soldiers are currently on active service.
"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiffs," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are not permitted to the service in the fight, it is the only distinction in the name: modern wars have seldom clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers increasingly important roles, particularly in the conditional contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: died 150 female soldiers, two-thirds of them in clashes between the two wars.
It is time that the military will be modernised, Burke says.
And she is not alone in their fight: three other complaints, except their are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran ' Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a misogynistic atmosphere.
This independent, the non-profit Vietnam veteran of America, a complaint against the military in the diagnosis of "personality disorder" to dismiss the rape victims received them from the service - a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Their group was in December, a complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which she accused her discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who claimed to be sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws has been presented separately by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress, which offer a number of leads.
In 2010, according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3158 sexual abuses.
But most of the abuses are not registered at all, and after its own estimate of the Pentagon's account of the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 cases, per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examined the rates of law enforcement: 2010 came 20 per cent of registered cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke's describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma.
In the case of Lymans reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
On this night, she says she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a section of his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked after the sex they had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people said that as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, which was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought I would go into labor, I ran screaming from the courtroom."
"They brought me in the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came back, my commander said: this was not his procedure, which was my procedures."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and unable to service.
It has been disgracefully redundant, so that they have no support in January 2010.
Whether the complaint submitted Lyman and the other plaintiff, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised for the first time, it called into question.
I am living a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is lagging behind a decade because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence, the liability.
He adds: "the odds are against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing is not their way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, with hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, which always comes first.
