The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and lack of knowledge about China, Iraq and support for Israel.
A crisis weakened America can be a complex world with simple, not to say: silly ideas?
If the Republican presidential candidates, listening to the voters could almost get that impression.
For some days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and her companions thundering declarations and statements on foreign policy, traditional Republican focus, consistently reported.
On China, Iran and Israel aid - often based in any way - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" the highest in the forthcoming rate Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO, and it is the "currency manipulation" - leading issue in America, by the exodus of entire industries to Asia irritating prickly - to accuse.
Stupid, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama, and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost about his emotion flatter management strangled.
He had a firm hand, but called for constructive talks with Beijing (also Obama's current position).
But Huntsman is not heeded, as it has stagnated in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney also had praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halting the nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I commands Iran," he had tinted.
"Obama will be re-elected, they get the bomb."
He has also strengthened Israel promised military aid and accused Obama remained to be partners with obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, for its part, has a shameful acts of ignorance.
He recently called on to give the Chinese military threat counterproductive to develop since Beijing, "a nuclear power" - and seemed to let the fact that China is already since 1964 in possession of military Atomar arms!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, for its part, to be ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
The 2009 Obama forbade recourse to torture measures against alleged terrorists was also by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current presidential opponent, Reagan also have had simple ideas and despite the Cold War.
They had to call in memory, that Obama selbstein amateur and water in his wine, which was the subject of anti-terrorism.
They are insisting on the right to the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, he is also the reputation of the weakness.
This harassment, however, is not quite as it pleases.
The population estimates the more positive assessment of the National security under Obama, the elimination of Bin Laden.
Since the Iraq asserted before military intervention, which lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised adequate, he argues, America must be economically developed his leadership position.
