The worst female vices: what is it with you?
If the men calls to give some typical female vices, they invariably shake some promptly from the sleeves.
The women you see in the following lines where we let a couple of abuse review, the men of the blood-wallen?
Shopping addiction
Raises their bits to be shopping addiction?
You must be at least a week to buy Hader?
You like to shop and also in action is a bit more?
Then it is really in your case a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of their shopping inclination to try to keep reasonably under control.
But hand on heart, what is there to try to find a well-seated Oberbekleidung only through clothes to bummeln and not all (in all kinds of color combinations in the booth?
Even if the shopping for the majority of women is a hobby for the men, it is often the pure hell.
They think, but how often she said her husband - you really better out there...
Constant discontent
"I am not too fat?"
"I would have to buy at least five kilos - I should begin to go jogging or Gymnastik?"
"I liked you?"
Somehow, they know this?
Yes?
Then you are also among the women, the rule of law are obsessed with how they look.
That is not that you should go, but many men allergic reaction, if their wife whinges about their appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed, the women are always dramatic, with increasing frequency of complaints.
Order and cleanliness in first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Scrub windows, tiles and dust sweep, sparing the bath - and at least twice in the week.
You shout with their partner, because he is again with dirty shoes tramples on clean tiles, you chastise the children, because that is just gescheuerte washing basins already filthy and because the Glast√ºr on the living room cupboard has fingerprints that extrapolate so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviances," then you should know that nothing can exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel could ultimately harm the mutual relations, and above all the rest in the family.
Taunting
"Dirty Turnhosen in the laundry basket."
"You want to attract the old socks really tomorrow again?"
"A watery towel raises not simply on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised to learn that he brings to the Palme.
This is clearly not bad, but they just want that everything is in order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not be so much to grumble.
Gossip and novelty
Some clap and women, as getuschelt behind the backs or slandering or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they are lagging issues such as, for example - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us has a little harmless gossip and novelty.
Hand on heart, that is all women.
But that is not to be confused with the major gossip aunts calibre where nobody and nothing is sacred, despise everybody in their environment, and particularly for collective women pose a significant threat.
