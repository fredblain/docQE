Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers in such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people in search of a job.
Today begins the 15th week of work for disabled people. "
Despite a purposeful public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate is always disabled people twice as high as the average value: 19% against Arbeitlosigkeit 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, Éric stressed Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, the organiser of the week's work for the disabled."
"Within 15 years of progress."
"The unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to do."
However, it must be said that, for disabled unemployed continues, there are many obstacles before they get a job.
More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with qualifications.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled persons to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria, a fresh start working, and the "heart of the problem," Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, a 1992 association set up to recruit businesses to help disabled workers.
So much for the brakes.
The underlying implication, mentalities, certainly, but slowly.
A weak note in April by the Association of IMS-Entre prendre for the magazine La Cité study gave the surveyed managers have " a level of disabled people, " which was " represented " by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually less well-off. "
The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go before the employment target of 6% disabled people employed in a 1987 law was written.
The latter, originating from the 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at 3%," reported Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is mandated to raise contributions from companies that this law.
The proof: "pay fees" plants has been reduced as well as the amount of contributions between 2007 and 2011, and numbers of 59000 to 46000 (606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which increases, created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also brings a real insight, particularly in the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry for work only 59% of plants between 20 and 49, disabled staff employed, companies with 100-199 staff against 82%.
