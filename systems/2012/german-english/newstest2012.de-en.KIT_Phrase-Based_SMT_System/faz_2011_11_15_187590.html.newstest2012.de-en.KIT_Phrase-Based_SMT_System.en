The threat is real
After the discovery of " Zwickauer cell ' Turkish media in the German state of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" now resurgent.
The murders of eight Turkish ethnic and Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000-2006, had a legal extremist background.
This news will be in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and concern.
For many German türken returns in a long totgeglaubtes ghost: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with legal extremist background against Turks.
That in Germany there is xenophobia, however, was never in question.
This revealed right-wing extremist network reveals, however, proportions, whose dimension is still a long way.
"The bloody ideology lives again?" The headline in the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper, "Haber Turk."
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, stressed that one of the perpetrators have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities could be involved in the radical right quagmire.
She calmly responded the Turkish community of Germany: remembered at the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate, the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In cheery colours was orchestrated coexistence - a history of success.
As a slap in the face because the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the Fünfzigsten" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform, "Haber X," cites the background to the series of murders.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" it is not to take these ideas.
"It starts to stink," the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany have done with their work.
It will be extremely critical discussion in German Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and later investigative success.
Why the German authorities is not much more, to look for suspects in extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some shows, at least rhetorically, to drastic measures: "will continue to be done here, the migrants have no other option than self-defence and weapons."
"This is probably the best self-protection."
"The quality of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium."
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks demonstrated by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living more apparent that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, raised their feelings on the Turkish side.
Not to repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was particularly criticised the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, however, represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral in Cologne - Kinkel was in his speech on how many charges for domestic Turks.
As calculated the value of a human after its tax levies.
The current coverage of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the domestic law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a wide-ranging education and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs open words this time.
