<seg id="11">Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively, probably not the best and would change the Libyans hardly mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this respect, it is rather surprising that the Muslim fighters from the infidel dogs help at all.</seg>
<seg id="13">In their defence, may well serve only the fact that NATO's bombardments not by any General from America, but from Allah self-guided, whose omnipotence after every successful hit was praised.</seg>

<seg id="14">The winner in Libya? The West is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were only in a gun, served the interests of Islam and reasserted our politicians in the hands of a political ally, without any advantage.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the fresh and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw more of a military occupation of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is a concern going on here - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn, I had a bit gemeckert that is a bit too much fuel for the start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Little did I not in the slightest, even more.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lectures from three professionals from the industry, the clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how the "on the job".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">There is worse to come.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer examination, the more information and practical tasks we have before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But even if the rate each on Saturdays and Sundays, it is fully documented.</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we debated with director "Ethyl '(the rate is not one man's), as it attracts a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And this is, after all, most of us.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some have a short neck, the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a matter of Stylisten, broad shoulders look to conceal the neck or the need to extend hervorzuzaubern curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We also got clues, as a Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - with great bosom, broad hip and narrower pretty slim waists and attracts figure emphasises, without being too provocative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example, the difference between slim waists and Hüften is so great that the skirt or trousers really not fit, you should at least a little under schneidern.</seg>
<seg id="14">This will certainly not regret it because, well-seated clothing is simply unaffordable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In such a tailor-made rock you feel is much better than in an off-the-shelf, and constantly verrutscht of slim waists absteht, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Jungenhafte characters can, in turn, allow clothing with wrinkles, construction, applications, embroidery or Raffung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">With this amount of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week, I thoroughly over.</seg>
<seg id="18">And yet, I fear that in the face of assigned homework almost impossible to achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each of the course participants received a Promi allocated for which they should devise suitable attire - days clothing and Abendrobe.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is the current design, fashion and style of the respective stars whose Figurtyp account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I should attract Miranda Kerr "," you may be the campaign Victoria's Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I juble internally, because this is for me personally, much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera to attract the last time has grown to hundreds of kilograms (okay, this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, and then grafisch first.</seg>
<seg id="24">In "Moodboard", as the outcome is known, is our personal style and our relationship with the Count's design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is very important, even on the graphic side of the Stylings.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Stylist, the model is not only physically, but also in the so-called product side in the journal (for specific target, for example, trend-handbags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it was only on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This means that a Stylist have a good overall picture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">With information on the types of characters angefüllte Saturday lecture was equal three visitors from the industry seasoned:</seg>
<seg id="31">The Stylisten Jan Pokorný, from Jakub Polanka fashion designers and fashion photographer Ben Renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion is a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this.</seg>
<seg id="33">Stylist and eingeschickter can with a single piece of clothing in a completely different way to work.</seg>
<seg id="34">The magic word is variability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">You can, for example, a business as usual on the Trenchcoat wearing jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but also on the naked body, shoes and attract him to wear a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is enough, the sleeves or the collar hochzukrempeln and equal, the whole look very different.</seg>
<seg id="37"> "Is it," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But most of all, I want the following advice: "First you perfectly know the rules."</seg>
<seg id="39">"Only then can they violate it," said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally, clear to me why we need all these theories loud fanfare, which you can combine with what and why, even if in Modejournalen often quite different to see.</seg>
<seg id="41">Not to mention of fashion look.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographers Ben I know now that a Stylist much more clothing options must be prepared when he photographed at the end.</seg>
<seg id="43">So it must be for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared at least 15 to stylen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes quite different than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">All of this must be in shaping the attire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That image and Styl sometimes half of success, which also Jan Pokorný confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="47">You only need to Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer, from the image and marketing a world star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic is one of the services of a Stylisten rather wary.</seg>
<seg id="49">Well-known personalities do often wasted money (the main thing is that I am, as I look at is secondary).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if one of us stylen, then we should expect that he or she is likely to have a very different (smaller) size on when he or she really needs.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then we need only to subsequently googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the corresponding Promi again or have declined, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Jan and Mario presented to us on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the clothes "assemble" needs.</seg>
<seg id="53">In his work he needs above all to communicate with the people he stylt and it must be a clever psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">People, without anzubiedern and his opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"If we have any manager in order to their clothes cabinet to look and beautiful pieces, then it does not eliminate the entire cabinet and say, my God, this is terrible."</seg>
<seg id="56">"We must find at least a few good things to which it recommends what they can contribute," says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He also showed us exactly what such a so-called "seat pocket".</seg>
<seg id="58">So a pocket in the slim waists zuknöpft and all necessary Proprietäten in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">No such clear things like scissors, Abroller remove the hair or safety needles, it contains, such as a Nylonfaden (so that helps the Stylist the photography products, such as handbags and hats), specific clips, which is behind the clothes gerafft, if it is too large (Stecknadeln or other klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken Nähzeug) and of course.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">But we must not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to put right in shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">The photography studio, where the floor is, you can damage the Schuhsohle, let alone the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Us o klebten and klebten we...</seg>
<seg id="63">With the gap, we should not affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.</seg>
<seg id="64">So we really must be sent.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario enjoyed me by my "creation" praised without restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="66">The aforementioned skill is not just my strength.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">All this was just a fraction of what we in the second weekend-continuation rate to hear.</seg>
<seg id="68">One thing is clear to me now - the Styling to devote at professional level is not an easy task.</seg>

<seg id="1">V need for speed, "the run '- the illegal race across America</seg>
<seg id="2">Review</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Originally, careless driving through a series of entirely preventable, dilettantischer error routine journey for the early shift.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was, for the most part the ambitions, but what use is that, if there is clearly no one wish to do a bit more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before he came to the shop tables, inspired the new part with the title "The run 'high expectations.</seg>
<seg id="6">He promised but already bejahrte games series' need for speed "a step in a new dimension and in the spielbaren demonstration in play, he seemed genuinely not only one of many Action-Rennspielen.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were also curious to know how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">But as it is already used in NFS is ultimately a lot different than it had expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sure, there are potentially very decent Arkade-race, but overall the game will be diminished by some unnecessary mistakes in this series is more or less for a couple of years.</seg>
<seg id="10">So it is not really a mistake more and more signs of basically incomprehensible laziness of the games developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">First will be introduced in history, whose main character Jack certain problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">In San Francisco, on the west coast, you get wheel - with the task, as the first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The basic idea contains a number of interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">The entire route is in ten stages and distributed more than 50 individual race.</seg>
<seg id="16">This means that every race on other route will be fought and that the various stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is no moment the impression that game would offer the same thing over and over again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some environments are still very nicely, although the technical level of graphics than that of the previous sections of the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">So nothing earth-shattering news.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the journey through the desert, herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Atypical elements and bring a little change in the individual race.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in the desert will be surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts view.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the mountains, in turn, should you need to watch your step that cannot be killed by an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">By the way, are quite good running built in the individual race.</seg>
<seg id="25">Only a few, but they are.</seg>
<seg id="26">For a while it tries, the required number of opponents to overtake (in principle a classic race), you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then a still expects a personal duel with a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this is also the police who wants to blow the whole thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is more about some interactive animation is a huge hit in which Jack before anyone fleeing and where the players must help him, at the right moment, the right button.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is surprising, however, that the game is much less such passages, as one would expect (specifically, only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">Ultimately, this is the matter more benefit, because at least this element has no chance of being boring - it is in the context of the high point to the elements that make the game diversify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The Fahrmodell Fußtapfen continues in the previous sections.</seg>
<seg id="34">This means that from today's point of view, there is no trees, on the other hand, you could not claim that it would be bad.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who looks realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But an action invited the European Fahrmodell Rennfahren will continue to play very well, although we could find better in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="37">Until then, as far as everything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Real problems arise only after a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the Fahrmodell collision model is not quite OK</seg>
<seg id="40">In a game of this type is hard to expect that complex disorders and collisions, but if there is virtually no impact on any object clue as to how the car, then it is obviously not everything in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Case in point: The close-up or just to oncoming cars "scratches" in some places the other car only slightly, in another, almost identical situation but it turns into a tailspin and wild Pirouetten.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or the Karre equal to scrap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the Restart-system which is nothing more, as it is always annoying.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rest Arts are resolved, if total damage or remote ends up the line, then cast a the game back to the last point of the route.</seg>
<seg id="45">Only - in every race has only five rest Arts.</seg>
<seg id="46">If it has exhausted, everything is happening again.</seg>
<seg id="47">The rest Arts is more like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but it should be abandoned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes, but not even the Restart helps, as does nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn.</seg>
<seg id="49">Very embarrassing is that the same things often happen in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some curves, for example, to pass through very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Elsewhere, we met at the relevant point "civilian" cars are in the same configuration, whether it be the first and fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is particularly galling in situations when you see that the Kontrahent a romped to two oncoming cars get away, but before it even gets to the car in such a position that they must avoid or slow down.</seg>
<seg id="53">And it does not matter when you get there, everything is designed to this situation is close to your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The opponents have other benefits.</seg>
<seg id="55">Throughout the game, there are a few places where you always at the same point being overtaken by the same opponents and again, regardless of the time.</seg>
<seg id="56">This is the most insane at the end of the game on the long bridge in the direction.</seg>
<seg id="57">The Kontrahent must here seem hell bent on overhaul.</seg>
<seg id="58">And if he gets one, then of course it makes a point of view, so they started their own car a couple of times in Klump.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Clearly, it is simply the game more exciting and exciting events but this intention is so clear that they quickly vermiest the joy of game.</seg>
<seg id="60">And that is a pity, because despite the game as a whole sold Fahrmodell is quite entertaining and in places such action also charged that almost no longer knows where one of the head.</seg>
<seg id="61">And in principle, regardless of what it is to blame, the concept of 50 unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that can prevent boredom, or something else...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is also the car exchange during the race.</seg>
<seg id="63">The stations we must not overlook the route, because here we can change the car, although in most cases the car enough that you just did.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are split into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super-sports car for the technical operations, for example, at the Serpentinen in the mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Hand in hand with the way the game history is also the tasks-mode (challenges) - the race in the various premises, which we know from history.</seg>
<seg id="67">There are not only medals, but also experience points for their own profile, which together for the tasks (challenges) and history.</seg>
<seg id="68">In order to achieve a higher level of drivers, must be open to different objects: The car started to Backgrounds for the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is the online operation Autolog, among other things, the results achieved compared with those of other players and also for further collective functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the more incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here it is: The car in a subway tunnel (as), where one in the dark on the track long-rast (as).</seg>
<seg id="72">Look at the Tacho points between 150 a 200 km/h (as), but there is suddenly from behind a subway and drive to scrap an uncompromising.</seg>
<seg id="73">In our editorial we may still argue about whether a blackout of the game makers was or whether the authors is so stupid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases very appealing and even brilliant here and there.</seg>
<seg id="75">All the more galling is that some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing and that sometimes quite dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="76">It is, however, specifically the accidents with greater number of concerned, where a continuous FPS is useless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">As far as the Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a bid to as wide as possible scale more young audience, was a Sound Track a lá "of any more" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall impression of need for speed: The run? The feelings are more mixed.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game is not by the aforementioned totally unnecessary errors would have held the belief we can claim that The run the best piece of NFS in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But the game is somehow unfinished.</seg>
<seg id="82">In for a klasse pleasure, but you should be prepared that one of these mistakes with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern sting in the eye.</seg>

<seg id="4">I would not have expected such a hard war flares. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"There will be five or six years, until the dust settled, and all of their new role will be used," girl Milena Vicenová began, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply its presentation at the law faculty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How seriously they the motto "understandable and openly about Europe", they showed in the first part of her speech, in which it was the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations on such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some editor of Charles University's law faculty can therefore would envy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Madam Vicenová also praised the new permanent president of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"At the beginning, criticism that he was too quietly - a grey official who was not up to such a role, but I have to say that it has brought all of how well he has adopted the cause.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He is a man who has 27 Member States patiently listen, communicate with and, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said it as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call? ", as an important step towards agreement and better visibility of EU policy towards countries, such as China or India.</seg>

<seg id="13">The Czech Presidency of two years ago, describing it as a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs have overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also the summit for Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fall of the government during the Presidency, describing it as a great Negativum that the image of the Czech Republic was severely damaged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of the ambassador, said that it was not just the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis is not yet over, pretty hectic.</seg>
<seg id="18">And there is still the seven-year EU budget be approved, which is precisely because of the current economic situation is much more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whether it is a slim and thrifty budget will be the priority sectors which countries more or less be encouraged - all of that is now on the agenda.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs in the reputation of Eurosceptics, the more negative than positive aspects of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="26">All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to motivation to write letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the successful Czech Presidency underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.</seg>

<seg id="30">According to Mrs Vicenové expect the EU in the future, especially tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We have here the eurozone countries and the countries outside the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of bestärkten cooperation."</seg>
<seg id="34">"For the first time, it was said that only the countries should cooperate, who want it and who do not want to be left out."</seg>
<seg id="35">"There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately to a strong" multi-speed Europe ', "Mrs Vicenová expected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues with impact on the whole of the EU will be discussed by all member states, and not only by the countries of the euro zone.</seg>

<seg id="2">The innovator IBM is into the second century of its existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If you are looking for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most accurate, it would be the word 'longevity. "</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public is IBM a synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern businesses, although since its inception a century has passed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis for this longevity has presented its first chief - the visionary Thomas J. Watson first</seg>
<seg id="6">He was already the slogan, countless global problems could be solved easily if people were prepared to consider a bit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan: "Think!" Was the trademark to the life of the future giants (and, at the same time, the title of the corporate internal magazine with IBM already publish began in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">This was also the basis of Watsen thoroughly prepared corporate culture.</seg>
<seg id="9">"For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not shied away from using everything surrounding it.</seg>
<seg id="11">This allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technologies, the Business and also to transform society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that the next hundred years to create even more, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thought-out system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson has been carried out in the 1930s social care of its employees, in a similar way, such as entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had to be one of the first American workers paid leave, an insurance through employers plus elegant uniforms and work clothes and a reasonable remuneration system for best innovators and traders.</seg>
<seg id="15">As more sophisticated, the long-term relationships with customers by IBM.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company was brilliant in the talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the head of IBM Palmisan next year by a woman, of Virginia Rometty abgewechselt.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been 30 years at IBM, before they took the position of Vetriebs, marketing and strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM power in recent years, so-called online brainstorming session, from which many future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Not surprisingly, there is no shortage of ideas, the company is almost half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good reputation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Their unshakeable position in the business for the company and a strong image at home and abroad.</seg>
<seg id="23">"From the beginning, IBM was the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist the professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technology company, but a firm, the business through technology helps solve problems," added George Colony of Consulting-firm Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself points out, there is a difference in the market to be present only by the presence or him directly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - in the states of their logos for family "Big Blue", in a century, is one of the largest companies in the world has come of age.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is one of the most diverse technology companies have developed - IBM hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product broad - from servers to nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">Of all the American technology companies, IBM most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">His most famous inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the diskette.</seg>
<seg id="30">With approximately $220 billion in stock market value (market capitalization) was IBM this year, the second-largest technology companies (after Apple), and for the first time since 1996 Microsoft obsolete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations, the taste of the customers of today - for example, the attempt was unhappy with its own operating system, os/2, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC Jr.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Business is based on the forward movement, so we should not emotionell tied to the past," says to Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, IBM has no problem, its basic walls on various platforms to build - and if they do not work, they also leaving.</seg>
<seg id="35">Unlike the opponent Microsoft, in principle, with its Windows operating system stands or falls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Promising technologies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Part of the profits from IBM to the greatest extent services, software and hardware to participate in each one-fifth.</seg>
<seg id="38">It was 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share most.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profits for big assets worth $15 billion, at the same time, however, it has invested $58 billion in the shopping future technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">In these investment drive IBM after 2008, when the latter-day financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept across the world.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson faithful, in the middle of a major global economic crisis his investment volume increased.</seg>
<seg id="42">So far, it appears that the company IBM emerges unscathed from the current crisis.</seg>
<seg id="43">The value of the IBM shares rose raketenartig since 2008 by 120 percent and net profit of the company is growing kontinuell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The company slogan of IBM is: Everything can change not only the values.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is also expected that this flexible giant pulls off the next crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="52">And it was Flint, the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson hit for him in the management of the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">This Leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson's ideas until today the unbesiegbare culture and identity of the company.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the company until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, began, as the name suggests, with the production and distribution of all sorts of machinery for trade - of sausage-and Käseschneidern to cash.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the first four decades in which Watson the company, he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company, finance and on all continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so essential to the company that he whole forty years head sat in the chair, he was only by his son, Thomas Watson junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">IBM began under his leadership in the development of artificial intelligence work and developed the first Programmiersprache.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s helped engineers and computer from IBM NASA flights into space over the Merkur and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of people to the moon.</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, IBM in 1964, the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the number of IBM System/360.</seg>
<seg id="61">A classic PC, the computer-standard that time certain, came in 1981 under the name of IBM 5150 onto the market.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later veräußerte IBM his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, however, they bought the consul aunts part of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and rose to fully in the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy, IBM in the last three years, pays is the concept of "smarter planet".</seg>
<seg id="64">It is the intention of technologies to clever way has not even planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in the transport and in the cities of administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">IBM recently in the trade sector led the platform "smarter Commerce", which is intended to help the dealers, the whole of the business cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Development of the travel prices since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR authorized GOVERNMENT travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The travel agents were mainly sold only travel to the socialist bloc countries in the West were at the time, only a select few.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And so Czech tourists travelling to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic, the GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A lichte exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then beat Yugoslavia a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia severely restricted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A great paradox of the socialist era, it was that there are not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed under the socialist countries to travel freely.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen of ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even in the Soviet Union, then he wanted to go to a so-called invitation letter, otherwise Individualreisen were not possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Even then, the travel agents also travel to the West, but then we had to accept huge queues or sleeping bag before the travel agency sent, or at least "good friends" in the travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even so, the matter is far from over.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called currency commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" gives people - the others are not allowed to travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Czechoslovakia's currency was not a free exchange at face currency without foreign commitment so it would have been impossible to make the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West to find.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Which is why most Czechs weither spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas bought - a habit that lasted until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Velvet Revolution of 1989 revolution was followed by a trip to the foot of the Czechs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Until 1989, during a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, spent the Czechs last year 4.5 million of its foreign holidays in countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">An enormous paradox, whose today no longer aware, is the fact that one of the most popular holiday country the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Right from the beginning of the 1990s of the last century, the foreign exchange requirements in the neighboring West European countries, which is a huge wave of short visit especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Tschechoslowaken were long time from their trips to the West simply cannot get enough, everyone wanted to at least a couple of days there.</seg>
<seg id="18">So slept the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would then have the money for a shelter in the hotel or a pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature when they travel abroad by Czechs was a canning, beer and duration sausages etc vollgepackter boot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech koruna, after decades of our tourists were finally free to buy Western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and that the average salaries rose to 1997 in another important moment einmündete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demand for travel began the travel agents after 1997 prepare regular visits by charter flights, making air travel, thanks to the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly cheap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the late 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already exchange unemployment payments with all the advanced countries in the world, which made it even easier travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-velvet" travel was in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country-cleared after Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Of the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel in exotic countries every year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another important moment in the era of our "post-revolutionary" development marked, came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On 17 November 2008, the US visa requirement for Czech tourists on which our country is definitely in the advanced countries in the world einreihte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in their history they gave to a single holiday residence, including the cost of the holiday destination more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - again threatens a stalemate.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will know.</seg>
<seg id="3">To date, there is still no agreement on the electoral law to be elected.</seg>
<seg id="4">And this is no vote on the three potential successors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In June, Hašek of his role, and he asked his colleagues in the departure had to some and a strong personality, which could lead to the football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only - in the post Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers again Association, which is not able to agree on a common candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This was clearly on 16 September, as the new chairman should be selected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The delegates to the General Assembly were free of the People's House in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the negotiations led to any outcome and it was not only about the election itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">Indeed, you could not even agree on who is entitled to the full collection is only the statutory representative or with a power-funded officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion, a representation at full power base is not admissible.</seg>
<seg id="12">Disputes over the electoral law, however, continue to take.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Executive Committee did not more clarity on the matter at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if the views in relation to the election changed a couple of times - the nerve centre remained the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: How do we proceed in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The issue is the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether a different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairman of the FAČR firmly in the management of the professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to a registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate who expressed as the greater support in the chamber, for which he is standing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is reportedly ready to compromise that one candidate triumphs, the higher number of votes in both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the winner in this prozentuellen vote count at least a two-thirds majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Then the two Vorrunden make no sense, this method would the entire bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, it would be best to the election in order not to argue, but under current statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">This is also surprisingly Tomáš Paclík, even if it emerges that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely to Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="22">"My wish is that as far as possible the statute is elected."</seg>
<seg id="23">"So as not to be invented nonsensical ersatz variants, such as at the last General Assembly," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is standing for the first time in his comments and above all to abgrenzte Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta but remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">In his view, is the new chairman Nymburk be known and he believes that the candidate will work constructively in the future.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championship today would certainly help to calm the emotions."</seg>
<seg id="27">"If the football only on the euphoric wave sunset, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten and this brings the most experience at both professional and regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">There is more circumspect Rajchl.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes," zurechtzubiegen. ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"That is why a new block in the General Assembly is not excluded."</seg>
<seg id="32">"However, I hope that common sense prevails at the end," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties, not more.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some allegedly direct negotiations should take place in Montenegro, but who knows whether the Fußballgeneralität until qualification is complete.</seg>
<seg id="35">The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera Rajchl after Podgorice should fly in Prague in the morning because of a technical disorder and not as it sought urgently for a replacement variant, as a part of the executive committee but still at the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the end, then surely the meeting at ministerial level, which it said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education, the divided parties within the country's largest sports associations to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is a lot at stake: Benefits Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting ČSTV of the Czech Sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík goes in the battle for the position of chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting would make a strong candidate, for all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) have been met, he would have no cost to the fight for the leadership agreed.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If there were a good candidate, then I would fight for him and for the election."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But in the current situation, we did not find such a Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The main reason for Paclík into duel with Mr Jindřich Rajchl Pelta and, it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, at the top of the FAČR.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also stresses that it if he wins the role of chairman is only a year until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the position of chairman, he would have liked to hear a top managers, not too much in the football is done.</seg>
<seg id="46">"With a number of eligible people I have spoken personally."</seg>
<seg id="47">"Hard to believe that some have said that they intend to do not currently identify with the Czech football.</seg>
<seg id="48"> "Such views would like to have changed," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Most of all, disturbs Paclík Pelta's alleged links with the chairman of the Football Association novel Pilsner district Berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta holds the position of chairman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"In his victory would today's state einkonserviert and the Czech football if it was not at all."</seg>
<seg id="52">"The support of Berbr, a cleverem businessman, would get the football twice as bad," said Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">It is also important that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with telephone to identify in a corruption affair, however, emerged from the Pelta with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I do not know what the prestige of a victory of the (tsch Pelta.) football should bring."</seg>
<seg id="55">"And as we would in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA position," said řekl Paclík, his former phrase, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman shall," but rather more calmly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Should Paclík in Thursday's election win, but he could be a future cooperation with Pelta well imagine.</seg>
<seg id="57">As is also another candidate - Rajchl, Paclík before the general Assembly in October had supported, which ended in a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go."</seg>
<seg id="59">"He has great skills."</seg>
<seg id="60">"I would have him well, for example, as head of the national team."</seg>
<seg id="61">"But I do not believe that he is capable of, the association as a manager."</seg>
<seg id="62">"It is not my nose in matters that I do not understand," said Paclík, raised eyebrows in September it had ensured that he was behind the recall the referee Commission Luďěk Macela at the top was replaced by Dagmar Damková.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.</seg>
<seg id="64">And holding up his skills in the direction of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, with its support in May, the first triumph in the league was celebrated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the power to something in the football environment and to a degree of cultivation of this."</seg>
<seg id="66">"The impact of certain interest groups which tend to disciplinary and appeal commissions to influence what until sickening situation deteriorates," Paclík led to no secret of his antipathy towards the Sparta, for example, Daniel Křetínský.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">As one of its priorities, he saw the consolidation of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, through which he among political leaders to evoke that more money from the lottery tax in the sport.</seg>
<seg id="68">"This is one of the key things that the new chairman should pay."</seg>
<seg id="69">"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, such as the political parties to declare, then I understand their reasoning, then they must also make it quite clear where the money is," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">His link to the Pilsner Paclík club is also not a handicap, although he stressed, the chairman of the FAČR should "bipartisan".</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It is not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="73">"It is my opinion but not much point in my stock in the Pilsner club hypocritical to transfer to a third person, in order to return again after a year and a half," said Paclík clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">New statutes of FAČR Pelta promised a stalemate ausschlössen in future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt, Miroslav Pelta, he will be in the event of his election campaign that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law rule out.</seg>
<seg id="76">The official from Jablonec is before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be in any success of the Czech selection safely defused.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta had not carried out before the election in September promised that he would, if elected to the national team and the collection of funds.</seg>
<seg id="78">He decided only at the last moment in the election before the last general meeting and didn't want him to take part in the two-month pause to help his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"People at all levels are devoted to the football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known."</seg>
<seg id="80">"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who, says the man who, especially with the Jablonecer club, but also many years in Sparta and acted in the Executive Committee.</seg>
<seg id="81">He also believes that he has sufficient experience, the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that for today's problems with the election euphoria is responsible, the days of Ivan Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately, the General Assembly approved in June statutes, which were not as perfect as we all thought.</seg>
<seg id="84">If they are not allowed to have different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman from September, "Pelta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The revision of the main document of the citizens association he used as a lure for the delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I were president, I take it personally and I am willing to take personal responsibility, if it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="87">"This is a fundamental issue, without which it cannot be" Pelta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">In addition, he does not try to define his opponent.</seg>
<seg id="89">He had earlier announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">He also Tomáš Paclík, no longer, which in turn to Pelta no dry thread.</seg>
<seg id="91">In football, he has moved more than a year and is already on some successes. "</seg>
<seg id="92">"His attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="93">"So now doubt many of his true character," Pelta addressed his opponent, probably remain faithful to its repeating proclamations that he already in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">In his view, is his strongest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="95">And this should be the flagship Czech football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"I would also like to put an end to all Affairen Bohemians - of fog, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year."</seg>
<seg id="97">"I would shortly after on negotiations with the private and public sector, with sufficient funding to ensure the whole football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football would mean no human cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I would like to start with the job content of all employees to familiarise themselves," he said towards the Strahov where, because of the long anarchy has understandably nervous.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="101">"If the only point of contention is how, in the third round, then we come over."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Football needs credibility and win it only when he finally has a new leader," Pelta, two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him hard work begins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If the current vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, it would supposedly many people in the Association of the whim vermiesen.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice to work hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee for individual football fields.</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition, he promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, relations with UEFA and FIFA, more money in football and otherwise, to continue the work of previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"As chairman, I would like to dedicate the football as a whole."</seg>
<seg id="109">From the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, the professional football, down to the performance of the youth football. "</seg>
<seg id="110">"This is not to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member of a certain area."</seg>
<seg id="112">And I will be hard work, so that the football in each segment with miles steps forward. "</seg>
<seg id="113">There were many not just delighted because they, rather than just the work of other now itself should start to work really hard, "he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered, no longer standing.</seg>
<seg id="115">"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."</seg>
<seg id="116">"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, which I am not constantly spanner and every step I do, in question," he said as an explanation as to why he hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="117">"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would do."</seg>
<seg id="118">"This is confidence that it must not waste," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">Also allegedly motivated him to be able to continue the work he has started in Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="120">"In two years we have done a great deal of work and I will now not simply throw."</seg>
<seg id="121">"There were launched processes that have to wait for a few years to come and I would hate to see that they stopp someone," he said, and now his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta were elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe in systematic approach and that is something that not Mirek Pelta."</seg>
<seg id="123">"Behind him, especially people who would make the football so that it is only for politicians."</seg>
<seg id="124">I can be blamed for some, but not that I would be biased. "</seg>
<seg id="125">"I am trying to do is to be objective."</seg>
<seg id="126">"I want football for everyone, because it all goes well and not only the selected," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">It also rejects the claim that he was a leader of the Czechs.</seg>
<seg id="128">"Even if some people say the opposite, I was really the best possible for Moravia."</seg>
<seg id="129">"For example, it is time to consider whether the league into a Czech and Moravian part should be divided, whose winners will each in the first league felt."</seg>
<seg id="130">"It might not happen today that only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," says Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the struggle for the role of chairman, has joined Rajchl dares not to assess his chances that he is elected.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen to its vice-chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor for unfortunate contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the association, not a single thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While he Pelta says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence to help," he holds the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.</seg>
<seg id="135">"No one can question it in Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job."</seg>
<seg id="136">"Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change."</seg>
<seg id="137">He would certainly not the things in its favour hinbiegen want, "Rajchl judgement on his rivals.</seg>

<seg id="4">Planschbecken in Ufo-optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travel through Europe, may be black magic - and after a city tour or a migratory the tired legs in Sprudelbädern rest.</seg>
<seg id="5">A book shows, where promotion in the water on the most beautiful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris Meder over the past year and a half on a research trip was not in her luggage had one thing missing: Her bathing suit.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rücklings on water, they looked into high art full-designed domes, they swam marble-Putten on basin margins on they waited, and was on meticulously restored Jugendstilschwimmhallen.</seg>
<seg id="8">She did a bad, they did so in their note book values - and to know details about the design and history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">More than 200 swimming pools architectural historian Meder answer in this way - and it is now in its just book "bathing joys": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">They led by 13 countries' trip to the most remarkable bathrooms in Central Europe ": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The 46-year-old German is a real bathing culture-Enthusiastin.</seg>
<seg id="12">With sports have not much in the news, says Meder - only in the water is the different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Annoying only that Schwimmfans with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell must resign, while the smell of Fichtenwäldern Jogger betörenden inhale or happy Vogelgezwitscher listening in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"One day I was asked why swimming pools are always have to be ugly," says Meder living in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="15">"So I began to warm baths."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Water surface doubled architecture</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The leap basin Geplätscher sauna and essential oils - the promotion factor in bathrooms is so great, because all the terms to be served, Meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builders of trouble, can be a real Augenschmaus Schwimmhallen: "Instead of a foot soil in bathrooms, a water surface."</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is transparent, reflects on the other hand, but the beauty of the whole building."</seg>
<seg id="20">Doubles every look: High vaults, colorful Kacheln, leap boards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The kleinformatige picture band "bathing joys" gives to 190 sides know value on the architectural and cultural history of historic promotion-havens - but especially appetite for a leap in the dark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Sammlerin Meder in their research in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition to magnificent Heilbädern as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-bath in Budapest, they found a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a Thermalbad, whose basin filled with water in bottles shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the other hand, many offer spectacular prospects beheizte Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria: While the entire city of Zurich Dachbad has in mind, one can in external pool of Bads in St Anton am Arlberg look at the snow covered - and that there is a window in Dampfbad, from which it continues to monitor the ski yard slope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expected bathers in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo.</seg>
<seg id="26">For three after the top open parings dampft there in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of Ötztals stand out in the sky.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the Black Forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Not in any swimming pool, the pool Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="29">After many Thermalbäder smelt sulphur, Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much for fuel oil, which hardly believes that landed in a bad health.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen medicinal water that almost black and whose silt a stain on the skin, once we are sliding into the basin, a promotion-experience of the special nature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In one place, Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing, however, also disappointed, as they have the freedom and the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz Sonnenbad wanted to visit, it was a abgesperrtes terrain.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 1902-designed by the architects Dušan Jurkovic bath has since been closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">As Meder verwitterten look through the windows of the red-white-and-yellow youth style-building raised, saw it as weeds between Fliesen wucherte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On the other hand, the decline was countered in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Palais in Wildbad thermal bath.</seg>
<seg id="35">Three construction schedules, this bad already behind it; you can discover not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-style, which was added in 1900.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="36">Since the thorough modernisation in 1995, the Palais's favourite thermal bath of pool knowledge Iris Meder - and not just because they originally came from the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is quite an achievement, so different Baustile at such a great unity to merge," says Meder.</seg>

<seg id="5">After mirror-online information, Josef Ackermann, a working group, the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the group's chief then consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg -</seg>
<seg id="8">For the German citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two-thirds of respondents want even that Deutsche Bank and other lenders for this business, because the problems of the world's poorest people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report presented by Food Watch in mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="12">It shows the author Harald Schumann, the betting on the global commodity exchanges pushing up prices - and therefore the banks involved in the global hunger problem.</seg>
<seg id="13">The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief executive Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Commodity bet were originally intended for traders to hedge against price fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now, most experts agree that the gamblers from supply and demand have - and at the expense of the poorest profits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Unlike the US competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism that he promised to look into the allegations and said that no deal was "worth the reputation of Deutsche Bank to jeopardise."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information obtained by Spiegel Online examines an International Working Group is currently the accusations from the Food Watch Report.</seg>
<seg id="18">By the end of the year is expected to be completed the test, then the results presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation, how it should be handled.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January, the head of the Bank will announce their consequences.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the end, a reduction of the commodity business, or even the complete departure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann forge his image</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Foodwatch-leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food, particularly sharply, as reckless banks today the common good."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, particularly in the duty.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Deutsche Bank must remove all installations from its portfolio, where money for betting on food prices will be used," said Bode.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people, or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The insight of Ackermann, at first glance, it is clear, however, that the group's leader, a few months before his departure from office would make a perfect picture.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Board chief differently than planned in the supervisory board will change.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a retreat from the contentious agricultural-speculation he could improve his image.</seg>
<seg id="29">And potential losses, it hardly needs to end his successor - that would have to be done.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Every second would terminate commodity-related facilities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch is trying to put pressure on the manager.</seg>
<seg id="32">So far, more than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="33">On Tuesday Bode published the poll by the Forsa institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 people questioned.</seg>
<seg id="34">Just 11 percent therefore believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank offers facilities where wagered on prices for food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Many bank customers would also personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: Half of the poll would terminate all facilities where money into the commodity-speculation.</seg>
<seg id="36">43% would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said to reflect on their account to drop out and to switch to another institution.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The umgezogene pavilion</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">By Ingeborg Wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">An architectural history with ups and downs and happy ending: The Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels, prices in 1958, was at the museum in Vienna, was empty and verkam.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now he opened an exhibition House.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If modern postwar architecture geschwärmt is clear forms, glass halls, courageous Schwüngen and new building materials that are typical of the faith to technical progress is the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Expo in 1958, a good and well-known example.</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzers pavilion at the time was the Eurovision Song Contest Architecture for his easy float along steel-and-glass-design.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction is up today as a landmark contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">He made it known that the architects of the next World Expo pavilion built in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich in 1973, he was internationally famous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">His as a temporary exhibition planned pavilion was built after the World exhibition at the Swiss garden in Vienna South station, in 1962 and converted to open a museum of the 20th century, "the 1920s house" it was called.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the building was not suitable space and technically as museum - no walls on the slopes of art, not a good climate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless, it was used for so long, and the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Belvedere museum opened Tuesday night at the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The fresh start has prevailed Agnes Husslein-Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, permitted by art historian with considerable career including youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg, converting to politicians and Denkmalschützern, they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and put to use.</seg>
<seg id="19">No contemporary art, the works of Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba issued by the eponymous Foundation, a café and a book shop, and it should be an office had to be built to house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict supervision, small budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For the implementation was the ideal Krischanitz occupation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because it in Vienna Secession Joseph Olbrichs sensitively converted and expanded and won the competition, but because he Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna has studied and the pavilion for him an "incredibly important place" was that he "almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which has been in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The current restructuring, there were far greater problems: The building was "a Energieschleuder," says Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">The profiles of the glass facade windows have been replaced, glass fibre reinforced Isolierglas and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Bridges cold-steel makers are increasingly or replaced, refurbished and asbestos blankets were filled.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two sub-shells room for the new use, a abgesenkter light gap between House and street provides the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy Schwanzer-pavilion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The original external doors have remained, the House is in the old rotbraunen rust-protection-Farbton removed.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema is even more exactly as it once was.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all of this under strict supervision of the memorial authority and with a small budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Often had to be found a material that is good and cheap, and also the Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and points to an abrasive soil in Untergeschoss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the constraints, problems and repairing the building is flexible and easily.</seg>
<seg id="33">It would have been difficult with the pavilion, "from Brussels than usual," Krischanitz has recently said that a typical "early-in-the-City history."</seg>
<seg id="34">Such a structure would "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "create a real awareness."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, the 21er House but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban fortune happened: The Swiss around the garden is completely new planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings.</seg>
<seg id="36">And another stroke of luck may still happen: The 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz-construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin Temporäre art hall bought, and we hear, they have negotiated with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.</seg>

<seg id="2">After the discovery of "Zwickauer cell" doubt Turkish media on German state of law.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology," which now auflebe again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The killings of eight türkischstämmigen and a Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme right-wing background.</seg>
<seg id="5">On this news will be in Turkey and in the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because for many German-Turks go back a long totgeglaubtes ghost: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no similar violence with extreme right-wing background more against Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Germany, xenophobia, but was never in question.</seg>
<seg id="8">The right-wing extremist network is revealed, however, proportions, whose dimension is still far from clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"Live on the bloody ideology?" Was the headline in the online edition of the Turkish newspaper, "Haber Turk."</seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, said that one of the perpetrators of a V-man of constitutional protection should have been, and is concerned that German authorities in the extreme right-wing swamp might be involved.</seg>
<seg id="11">Germany's Turkish community responded calmly: They reminded over the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.</seg>
<seg id="13">In happy colours was the co-existence has been staged as a history of success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">As a slap in the face, as the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform, "Haber X," of the background of the series of murders speaking.</seg>
<seg id="15">The German edition of 'Hürriyet' does not take these ideas together.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is beginning to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">He stressed that people had been killed, the taxes paid and their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had done.</seg>
<seg id="18">Is extremely critical in German-Turkish internet forums, the actions of the police investigation and their later success.</seg>
<seg id="19">Why the German authorities do not have much more was learned, in extreme right-wing circles after suspects to surprise the authors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some shows to drastic measures prepared at least rhetorically: "Will continue to be a sloppy approach here, the migrants do nothing other than self-defence and the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is probably the best self-protection."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The quality of education and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, shows up the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="24">The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because no other event showed the Turks living here clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance in right-wing violence can lead.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the attacks schärften the We-feeling on the Turkish side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not repeat the mistakes of the past</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the Turkish press was, above all, the failure of the German policy after the attacks highlighted the fact: Helmut Kohl, who refused to visit survivors of Mölln.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The scandal Bank of Zürisee</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The abenteuerlichste Bank Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS was nearly bankrupt during the financial crisis, and since then has been reeling from one crisis to the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now it is a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It was certainly not intended Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was bekanntgeworden in July 2013 an almost as spectacular new job, board president of the Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected large and lucrative career move.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber looked forward publicly praised Switzerland's UBS whether their beauty and whether their newly acquired solidity and friendly comments about the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The UBS has managed the Turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in September, it became clear that everything would be very different.</seg>
<seg id="11">A trader of UBS in London had all security systems of the bank and around EUR 1.7 billion verzockt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">UBS-CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers, had to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Board President of UBS, also wounded since then - and all ask: When will finally Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It was already known that Weber, the bank advised by February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the board before he takes office in May - not only in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber, the tough.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is not a banker, economics professor and central bankers and would have had time to get to grips certainly needed.</seg>
<seg id="18">At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again demonstrated that they have the title of "biggest scandal Bank of Europe".</seg>
<seg id="19">Because the UBS is huge, until recently, it was the biggest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, for years has been reeling from a scandal in the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, is the once-proud Swiss bank saves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started in the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters had combined with ambitious objectives: She wanted in investment banking, a very large number.</seg>
<seg id="24">It manages the UBS $1.6 trillion in 2007, on the one hand, high-net-worth clients more money than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And, on the other hand, was an investment bank in the league of the biggest banks in the world have advanced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This made impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: 'My students, I have the UBS was always regarded as a model of good bank. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"From today, one wonders: How could I just so wrong?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He was huge.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, for the first time appears to be that if something went wrong at UBS.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising back, until such time as high intellectual and equally ingenious bankers.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later, you guessed what, why he had gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">The investment banking division had with sub-prime securities verzockt and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">In order to shoulder the UBS announced a capital increase of as many as 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">It was indeed for investors, but what about the many until shortly before the nose gerümpft: A non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which it said was that it was not even his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But that was only the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, there was worse.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to announce new billion losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, following the disaster, the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation, six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, which the bank they Miteigentümerin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole country was shocked - because they said how dramatically it for a small country if it is so big banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">After all, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic).</seg>
<seg id="43">"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says banks researchers Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first disaster, the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">A few months later, surrendered the UBS in tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth clients, perhaps with the help of the bank being evaded taxes.</seg>
<seg id="46">They also agreed to pay $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this kid Strafaufschlag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">This well-known the UBS more or less open to assist in tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: The aura of secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal was the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was followed by the resignation of CEO and Board President.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of clients' money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">The bank within a few months of their credibility lost in two key business areas: In investment banking by the false speculation and asset management assistance to tax evasion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just a little calmer than it was just when you thought the UBS will now get it again, as follows this unfortunate dealer-story: An individual traders verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notes that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it seems to be: With the risk management in the investment banking work there is obviously still not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"With the case of Adoboli, we find that the risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">The financial management of a large German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS is that they are not in control of the risk control."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It was precisely the idea of caution, with the Swiss bankers took a long time ago, guardian of the major assets of the world: Not too many risks for security for money even beyond the Alpine republic in the world.</seg>
<seg id="58">The coffers of the Swiss banks have become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and particularly noble Sprüngli chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The headquarters of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of sterling Swiss private bank - it is just a bit bigger.</seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich railway station, the main train station from the Zürichsee leads directly by the snow covered summits of the Swiss mountains frames.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Juweliere as Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss tradition shops like Confiserie Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">Stay here for centuries, the Swiss banks, the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The reception hall of UBS, one enters through a heavy revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside, the walls are thick marble disguised, leather chair, in addition to the bank's logo is a great sign for "safe".</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer is looking here: Security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of the Swiss bank have both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually supplanted - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">His name, he would prefer not to read in the newspaper, after all, he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS is far too big, he finds - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had spread.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss have nothing more to say there.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And if they do, they have long since the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS modified, their only received high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution in the subprime jungle lost as much money as the Swiss large bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">On 15 October 2008, the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="75">"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million, the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-crash."</seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros allocated the politicians, from bankruptcy in order to save the big banks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How could this happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">Talk with Swiss bankers, so they see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks to a huge corporation.</seg>
<seg id="80">There was a bank that the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and increasingly grew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">It helped that the two different precursor-banks UBS supplemented: A rich, but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers favourable to a lot of money with which they have a huge wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are on the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, group chief executive of UBS, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says banks researchers Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, higher intellectuals, modest, a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the hard man, who is from the bank lesson to top up."</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel was finally left to Wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And in the end Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake, "he thought his models are the reality," says Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"This is a tragic case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is clear: Excess came before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">Staff at the UBS will remember clearly to the leaders' meetings in which company chief Wuffli was always the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone.</seg>
<seg id="92">The US bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="93">They led the league with "in the rankings, the success of the banks that time documented.</seg>
<seg id="94">Then, wanted to UBS, according to the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">A few steps, she has managed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="96">In foreign exchange business and the stock was trading at the top with them.</seg>
<seg id="97">Corporate advisers who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: International interest in the business, in which bankers language "surprise fixed Income," there is a huge gap with the largest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS have gaps in mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">To close the gap left UBS in an adventure that nearly cost them their existence.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, both the Bank itself invested and above their established hedge funds in American sub-prime assets.</seg>
<seg id="101">It became a huge machine, the securities on US mortgage loans packaged and far-reaching, but also risks maintained.</seg>
<seg id="102">Also, as other banks have sought out.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was on fire, the UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">So great the euphoria, so deep.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager had to go after the other and clean up the experiments tested more difficult than thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Items in the UBS became the weapon and are still shaky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Anyone who now leads the major bank, has an almost impossible job.</seg>
<seg id="108">He needs to find a strategy for a bank, which lost all obvious business models.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banks researchers Geiger already has an idea: Stop the investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">So far, the Bank may not (yet).</seg>
<seg id="111">But that investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually intended only as a temporary solution, as the bank is surprising Grübel separated by predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, he has won: He is in the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants the investment bank to roll back the in the mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">He cut 3,500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But it will not be enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">What do you make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now.</seg>
<seg id="122">So far only publicly he says that he and his wife, once a home in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">Next year.</seg>

<seg id="8">It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There is little ambassadors, reckless reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is less a book about what happened, he said, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, ideas, experiences and feelings."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Beauty and horror" almost the war experience of 20 more or less unauffälligen men and women on both sides of the war of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people are heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some will become prisoners of war, losing limb, crazy or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Each of these lives on as the Votivkerzen future has come in a church, some are added, while other lapse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">It also corrected the notion that the First World War was just the disastrous position war on the Western Front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Beauty and horror" ends with experts view on other war theaters: The Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is almost from the beginning, a very moving book.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war swamped the lives of these people as a natural disaster such as a hurricane Katrina, after Kordit smell.</seg>
<seg id="20">Imagine you are a woman who is at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance. You stay or take the flight?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who is at all?</seg>
<seg id="22">Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war is being fought.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Lack of facts," Englund is, "with suspicion, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares and rumours aufgemöbelt."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard stamp, a young German ship sailors.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other things have already taken (material.</seg>
<seg id="26">Their lives can be shocking or simply reports, but they are very alive in details in Englunds loses accumulation of small moments.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them act of shortages and affordable remedies.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the history of a German Schulmädchens told him: "Replacement, everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Spare coffee, false aluminium, false eraser, paper, wood buttons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He told more of the spare lunch in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">He describes "meat from large compressed piece of rice and in Hammelfett gebacken (and most recently served with a false bones from wood), tobacco, from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes with wooden besohlt."</seg>
<seg id="32">There was, as he noted, "837 registered food spare funds in the manufacture of sausages were allowed, 511 registered coffee substitute means."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories act of honour and bravery.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American acknowledges his own drive to the ferocity and says of the war: "It feels that, despite everything, that is, rather than for men was scheduled to sit in Lehnstuhl, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and to act as a means to such a veneer of civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and beschlagenen shirt breast."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely, a British soldier to die and that he probably nobody notice or would be done.</seg>
<seg id="36">"If one of the idea of self-sacrifice, we would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, it is so terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations act of the old Europe, the fall apart, and on new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">He starts the arrival of what he called "a new species in the young century Bestiarium": "The eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderers in the yardstick, the murdered while he sits behind a desk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unforeseen ways and there are equally frivoles behaviour as heroic acts.</seg>
<seg id="42">Englund is discussing the soldiers who are actively trying to a prostitute being infected with a sexually transmitted disease, in order to escape the front-line services.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The grotesque expression of trade can be found with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals, in the hope, to come to the hospital," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Those who really have been desperate rieben him in the eyes, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">This translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is elastic and yet unaufdringlich and fits in perfectly with his human task.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes he the way, as the war "on unique way uncontrollable forces Unbound: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."</seg>
<seg id="47">People are starting to ask why they fought for their leaders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books about the First World War were usually more distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In West nothing new" as a comprehensive history books.</seg>
<seg id="49">Englunds band is an unconventional glory hall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book has the most devastating end, which I have ever read in a Sachbuch.</seg>
<seg id="51">I am no longer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The union, the hundreds of Schulbetreuern last month have lost their jobs, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies because of their disproportionate influence on schools, poor students, not necessary and discriminatory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The complaint is probably the last chance, the trade union, District Council 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies, still open.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig Schulhelfer, care coordinators and other staff, are among the lowest paid employees of the city, and on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, the trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for that last year the city of access to a health care fund, which had the working groups, had denied the budget gap should be closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">These accusations were categorically rejected by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing of the City Council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, last month, the redundancies are part of the budget that was passed in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the City Council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget spezifiziere that Schulhilfe staff would be made redundant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Officials of the City Council 37 said that they had the Ministry of Education and warned against a complaint. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.</seg>

<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city was not the case and therefore could not comment on the specific allegations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draft complaint, the New York Times, the union has on the number of redundancies in schools in poor neighborhoods of the city, a complaint for discrimination. It claims that poor schools more workers would have lost, because they are chronically underfunded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It states that, while there was no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in schools or TriBeCa's Upper East Side, 17 Schulhelfer in the District 23 in Brown Ville, Brooklyn, and 46 workers have lost in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South bronx.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">With the discovery of the loss of five of eight Schulhelfern, 36 in the public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says: "This is not a neighbourhood worried parents who can organise donations to budget cuts."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">P.S.: The budget of the 36th Distrikts 3.26% this year has been cut, and have lost money, as the city of their calculation method for the extra funding for any poor school enrolment changed.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="15">The union also complained that the heads of the high schools through the language in a memo to mislead, which authorized the release of care coordinators.</seg>
<seg id="16">The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: Transfer) in the United States, usually the exchange of a teacher on the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers, who are paid by the central Unit.</seg>

<seg id="17">"But it seems the only way of support the person is in the role of unfortunate souls."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The issue is very sensitive for military leaders, not ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve to appear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have also acknowledged that the anger, the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War encountered was far worse.</seg>

<seg id="1">The military is growing pressure to crack in rape</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week is an important hearing about whether 28 men and women for failing to intervene in a rape accused before the military court.</seg>
<seg id="3">It should not happen, there are hundreds of prosecutor for the next hearing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant at night, when she was raped by a fellow soldier.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar just north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleagues, the one 12er Pack beer in itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked them whether they accompany a drink in her room.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My alarm went on," Lyman said.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texanerin wischte aside their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: 'Oh what he is 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">He is from Texas, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I wish I had in my gut feeling."</seg>
<seg id="12">A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and raped her, she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in deciding whether a complaint made against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, have admitted in court.</seg>
<seg id="14">The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the complaint initially included 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months to 28 increases: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to establish a proper jurisdiction to condemn or after the alleged attacks available.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke says that they have followed the top military leadership, because the problem there will begin.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The military is hierarchical," she says.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation by the leadership."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also says that since February has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future actions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their strategy: Instead of all claimants were lay their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints, in order to maintain the pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The team of defence for the Ministry of Defence, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, tabled a motion to reject complaint.</seg>
<seg id="22">The files of the court, the Newsweek, in detail, the lead defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military is not current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for violations that took place in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">As a result of the Supreme Court Act of 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government will not be liable for violations that troops on active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The alleged damage during the military service of the plaintiffs," states the document.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, it is the distinction only in name: Modern wars have rarely clear fronts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in the contact link with indigenous women in the war zones.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: Between these two wars 150 soldier died, two-thirds of them in hostilities.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time that the military will be modernised, says Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">And it is not alone in their struggle: Three other complaints unless they are pending.</seg>
<seg id="32">At Yale Law School, the veteran 'Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies, because of alleged promotion of women hostile atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="33">This independent collects the not-for-profit Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military, which is on the diagnosis "personality disorder", the rape victims received from the service in order to release a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.</seg>
<seg id="34">In December, the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with performance requirements for people viewing the said that the service had been sexually abused.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine laws have been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress, a number of leads.</seg>
<seg id="36">2010, according to the Sexual assault Prevention and Response Office, Office for Prevention and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3,158 sexual abuses.</seg>
<seg id="37">But most abuses are not reported and after its own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure included approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases, per year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report, which was published in March, also investigates the prosecution rates: 2010, 20 per cent of recorded cases in military court, only half as many as in civil law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of trauma.</seg>
<seg id="40">Lymans case reported in the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.</seg>
<seg id="41">On this night, she says, she was 11 times, the details of the rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders to tell.</seg>
<seg id="42">She had a rape set and the blood of their aggressor from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, was heard by a judge Lyman. During this hearing, she was asked after the sex, before the attack with her boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people have said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, which ultimately was acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman said.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought that would go into labor. I ran from the courtroom screaming."</seg>
<seg id="47">"They brought me in the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out to my commander said: That was not his procedures. This was my procedures."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman was invited to a military psychiatrist, in the end a personality disorder diagnosed and unable to service said.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010, she was dishonourable, so they have no support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whether the complaint, Lyman and the other claimants have put forward, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.</seg>
<seg id="51">Nevertheless, it says: "I think they should move forward."</seg>
<seg id="52">What between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which criticized for the first time since it was called into question.</seg>
<seg id="53">I am now lives a critic of the Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The military, a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, the liability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He adds: "The odds are against it... but it is important for them to try."</seg>
<seg id="56">These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the hearing is not their way, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We in this respect, the military will continue to fight until it comes to reform," she says.</seg>
<seg id="59">Or until we die, whatever the first.</seg>

<seg id="1">Walls have eyes: How researchers watching you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys, whose anti-immigration views online programs.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed in a killing spree in Norway in July to have committed, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite Breivik acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has a lot of time until his attack on his computer, with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, the right-wing extremist groups on the part of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, as we find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">This is easy - you only have to connect on Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We have found that it was not difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank demos on the digital populism in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Facebooks hide-and-seek personal data is so enzyklopädisch, says Bartlett, the researchers simply Werbetool side must use their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - as retailers for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartletts team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then with Adds visierte, but rather than with a new band or a new diet product verlinken, have invited the Adds users to a survey in which according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future was asked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to consult once had to leave her office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoter of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But in a kind of surprising distortion, "their online activism offline activism combined with a more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health and social trends such as "Likes" text messages and status updates.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users, on average, three content per day, data generated Facebooks supernova explosion "a research boom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side in the title in the last five years was almost 800% increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that we can study this side of people, which are normally in the street with his Clipboard not achieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">"If you previously tried to people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"They had to inform the party first and never have access to them," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook is all that away, you will go directly to them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the party offers an opportunity to identify and social health problems to solve.</seg>
<seg id="23">A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who were discussing their full binge on Facebook, significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who remained silent on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example, the Wohnberater side monitor and a student help if they too many status updates postet.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You can't solve a problem if you have not recognised," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have found an opportunity to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would have been found."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also constantly zapft data of its own people.</seg>
<seg id="28">The data team of side has statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a National Happiness index created (and primarily data have been used to access Facebook - the only master of digital freedom have known for a long time that the side of their great data mine of others for research purposes should make available.)</seg>
<seg id="29">But the users of Facebook know that the side they watched, whether they like it or not, with a friend, the thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, one of the side's own personal data auszubringen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if the users of Facebook part of a survey, they do not even know about?</seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers strictly defined guidelines as to how they collect data offline, anything goes online.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not believe that many users are reflecting on the fact that the researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006 in which he public pages of students on Facebook studied.</seg>
<seg id="33">"What concerns them, it was just about them and their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participants is absolutely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and contributions are true.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What we say and what you on Facebook outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a pen is still the best research tools -- that everyone can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">"There is no substitute for the real world and to talk with real people," he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Social research must be the social care - and plenty of social life is still offline."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">Judge Torkjel Nesheim canceled Breivik during this monologue, because he "wanted to give the possibility not Breivik this hearing to use as a platform to express his views."</seg>

<seg id="1">7 lessons of the interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which this week was shown in a theatre</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a great modern inventors.</seg>
<seg id="3">What Apple fans, but perhaps the most telling the recently discovered jobs-interview, which this week before special film displays on the major markets has been dusted off, is how much this creative head business processes and procedures.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous detail organizer, keen to Diagrammen bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders to "a disease of thought", "a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Bob Cringely in 1995, the TV series' triumph of specialist idiots "on the departure of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with jobs, in a rare, in-depth discussions.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this point, as 10 years have passed since jobs had been pushed from Apple, and he has worked hard on his new computer company next and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part of Cringleys interview in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jobs death discovered only after a full VHS-copy in the garage of the director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the film "68minütigen Steve Jobs: The Lost interview," this Wednesday and Thursday in the country Mark-theatre.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who is known for his detailed interviews abhors, jobs are surprisingly keen to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And incredibly thoughtfully.</seg>
<seg id="12">During the interviews, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds at home, where jobs are clearly weighing his thoughts and accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments when Jobs' perfect on days when he apparently impatiently awaiting him anschubst Cringelys questions and respond more quickly to issues or alongside acts of greater importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included the people interview somehow seems incredibly far-sighted if Jobs assesses what other companies make him right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to posthumous awards to read 'career jobs, but jobs here as the begierigen dreamers to see on the leap to the grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how things could be and should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly after he had said all this, and he made it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of lost interviews:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As he got a business to run.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Throughout the years in business, I always ask:" Why if you do things? "And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, it is easy."</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he does what he does, no one in the business really thinks about things in detail.</seg>
<seg id="22">I have noticed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline accounting for Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Puzzled as costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs" on mere suspicion towards were quantified and then with "departure" adapted, he developed an automated factory, which ensured that micro-business costs could be determined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As the Pope veralbert:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs told of the blue box "with Steve Wozniak built a device to creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the device much has already been written, but Jobs enthusiasm when he crossed the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung describes is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box, a gebührenpflichtiges phone use and then make a phone call from an AT & T's network to another, while so many satellites as possible by them.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We gave the half a dozen times around the world and if you into the phone grölte, there was a minute later in the phone next door," told kichernd jobs.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and we learned that we can build something yourself, the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world can control."</seg>
<seg id="31">Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a huge thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would give Apple without them.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs told further from a glorious d'état, Wozniak and he almost pulled out, as they are in the middle of the night in the Vatican via Blue Box ringing with the Pope wanted to talk, while it as best they could to Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">As several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomats, the two loslachen before the Pope himself to the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As he has in the technology verliebte (and unprepared Bill Hewlett dispute):</seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12 years ago, when he sought to spare parts, in order to build a frequency meters, he sought after Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after their 20-minute telephone call received a Teilzeitjob jobs for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It has had a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company that I had seen in age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well his staff treated."</seg>
<seg id="38">Later, Jobs one of the HP-staff, the research laboratories visited the company in Palo Alto, where he "the first desktop computers ever produced".</seg>
<seg id="39">He was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with wide brown master and I verliebte me in it.</seg>
<seg id="40">I would climb to the top as a teenager at HP and this machine, and programmes for they write.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">How to improve innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">Several times in the interview, Jobs about how spontaneously inventing new products.</seg>
<seg id="43">Early in his career when he some Platinen einbaute, he was asked by a customer, the entire computer to assemble them.</seg>
<seg id="44">He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to both the Zusammenbau and the extradition of ready-made equipment.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later, when Apple does he remember the problems in the development of a computer mouse:</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember very strong arguments... you schrien me that it would take five years [in order to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I was on, went out and found a manufacturer."</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we had a mouse, which we could build for $15. It was incredible credible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On large companies that continue:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before he was revived Apple, Jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants in Stolpern clashed with their vision and lost control of their shares.</seg>
<seg id="50">"We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox, so make a better Kopierer or printer, so what?"</seg>
<seg id="51">They have the stock monopoly, so the company no more successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">Sales and marketing make it successful, so these people [are], which will ultimately lead to the company and the product with which the people are pushed out of the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="53">The product genius, which has led to this monopoly of the people who have no idea about good products versus bad products, eradicated art, craft.</seg>
<seg id="54">This happened at Xerox...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox would have the entire computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">It would be ten times greater, the Microsoft in the 1990s can be...</seg>
<seg id="57">They have caught the defeat of victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">About innovation as an art form:</seg>
<seg id="59">"There is plenty of craft art between a great idea and a great product... if this great idea, they change and grow."</seg>
<seg id="60">You learn a lot about his subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="61">We must votes, certain things that you can't do, but electron, glass, robots, factories.</seg>
<seg id="62">We must see 5,000 cases, these concepts, and they all together...</seg>
<seg id="63">Ultimately, it amounts to the taste, it is that they are trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to bring these matters to you.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.</seg>
<seg id="65">We are always in stealing shamelessly grandiose ideas.</seg>
<seg id="66">Part of what made great Macintosh was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the health legislation, adopts a court case</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors in order to end the political part to discuss whether it is a challenge to the health law President Obama will hear, two of its judges, and finally there is Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, at a dinner attended by the firm gesponsort was that the case to court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases was a complaint, the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care have been adopted by Congress last year, a law that the conservative activists across the United States was the buzzword.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed the hearing. Indeed, in March a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion, probably the result will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, at a time when the court decision is announced, will be in full swing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to overturn, will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clements firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that the annual dinner of the Federal society, a veteran group, which is dedicated to the defense of conservative principles of law.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another company that has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., the financially in the outcome of the process is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.</seg>
<seg id="11">Service, including Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health reform</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The guests of Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This is nothing new: The two judges attend events of the Federal society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And this is not contrary to moral rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, to judge by the code of conduct, the actions of the lower federal courts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">They were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge can Benefizveranstaltungen law near and other organisations to participate, with the judges no spokesman, guest of honour or according to programme a host of such events."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the extreme proximity ranged from Scalia and Thomas on two of the case-related firms and companies with a massive financial interest in this to moral-and-government activists to alert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This startling break with morality and the contrast with the code belies the complaints of some judges lie, the court seems to play by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges and dinnierten won during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending trial on court."</seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and their support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas show little concern for critics who say they are legal matter too easily with groups that are on the agenda, such as the Federal society, mix.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">But the Conservatives claim that Judge Elena Kagan is a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance came to court.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its critics have urged Kagan themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias because they too involved in the defense of the law is to be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan is not about to do so.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence sector</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, as he previously warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon's to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon is already through cuts amounting to $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts to $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress does not end in the spending can achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham,.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that a failure by Congress in reaching a budget agreement, leading to a so-called seizure will lead to 23% overall cuts and a freeze of many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Such a large cut, implemented in such ill-considered way would most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot make three-quarters of a ship or buy a building - and other modernization efforts seriously hurt," Panetta wrote to the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We were also forced to involuntarily by a large part of our civilian staff to separate and that the reduction would be implemented quickly, we would almost certainly kinds of civilians, in order to achieve this goal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts were ultimately take the combat forces, "said Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"During the war time quotas in the anti-terror fight by the seizure not directly affected, would be a serious violation of the basic budget adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Staff attitudes have been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring, to supporting the war."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The salaries of staff would be cut, leading to late payments to war-time dealers, and the legal and political support would be disrupted."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she published Panettas letter.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly none that we should impose."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of senators on a compromise the pressure will increase in the budget or demands, the Pentagon will be exempt from cuts remains to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, even though he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House, before he came to the top of the Pentagon's, and knows that he faces tough decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference last week, Defense Minister graphic picture of a gloomy picture of what could face a military with skin, but without nuclear.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without sailors."</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is a brigade without ammunition."</seg>
<seg id="23">"There is an air without sufficiently trained pilots."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a force, there is a lack of morality and alert and incapable of dealing with potential opponents."</seg>
<seg id="26">"It is a really angry."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our global operational and Eingreiffähigkeit, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects the deletion could fall victim, including those who already have been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">This list includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike fighter, a planned new bomb plane, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The further development and testing of the F35 stop, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 billion dollars, but advocates say that it is an important next step is to build-up, so that potential dangers posed by China and other opponents can be averted.</seg>

<seg id="9">"What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts through the legislation to combat money laundering in Congress was adopted, because those who amass $banned way, it is not easy for them to work to invest or to use for anything," he said.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy, in order that the new government, the crisis that Italy to the brink of economic Zusammenbruchs led to confront.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A statement from the presidential palace announced that the Sunday appointed Monti on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, would make the government.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is expected that a majority will present special cabinet of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will assume office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said he would give the president the outcome of the talks with the political parties to form a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I would like to express my absolute confidence in our country's ability to deal with these difficult times, stress," said the former EU Commissioner journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti not explicitly endorsed the formation of a government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"The framework is now well defined," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting against the political and financial crisis, the cost of debt in an intolerable level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new, the former EU Commissioner Monti-led government needs to adopt a tough austerity package by the euro was called for politicians to regain the confidence in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The pressure to rush to Monti, accelerated by the volatile market situation, as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years have been burdened with 7% interest rate, which is the state in which Greece and Ireland have forced to request the European rescue package.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti with: "We said we would support this government after all."</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy emerges from this emergency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The chances of success were Monti by supporting the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, on Saturday had to resign as a result of the crisis, expanded significantly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti are destined to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far, many of its members against a majority of existing government of technocrats, the Monti just is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Support from Parliament</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="20">Opposition to his efforts or delaying the reforms could once again a devastating attack on the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian Association of foreign banks, with his reference to a failure of Monti was a disaster, also pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and employers' associations and youth and women's organisations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tuesday night's sitting round is to be completed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was appointed by Napolitano this Sunday, as a response to the crisis, an extremely rapid change of government has set in motion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After recent revival at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost to the Italian government bonds back critical borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A bailout of Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current EU rescue package.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti said his government should be up to the next election, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that the politicians to give him time to implement the reforms instead than the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti said he would like to politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this only from technicians should be a reference to their concerns in the face of pressure from the financial markets imposed procedure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources suggest that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties the inclusion of persons from political life is complicated.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Read an excerpt from the interview, whose full transcript in the online edition of La Nación.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For your Costa Rica niche fans realised a dream if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what it means for your fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In Costa Rica to play is a dream that is for us.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is only the second time that we in South and Central America, and so far, it is great.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am just once on holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will stay there a few days.</seg>
<seg id="13">For us, it is exciting, our music out there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely; they are the closest possible days before the concert.</seg>
<seg id="15">What does your your most enthusiastic fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you, all these years on our side.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have almost 21 years until we have come to Costa Rica. Thank you, have been waiting for so long, and we are very sorry to have taken so long before we got here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people are even of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is it not a little bit of pressure from your visit?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the greatest shows that we have in the past 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we fit for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">Indeed, we want to play there.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">As you Costa Rica and its waves to surfing got?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Many of our friend, a surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends are always on the surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the outstanding areas for surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have heard about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">With a view to the Tour you giant shows with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Do you have any plans for the event in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">We have never played there, we are also no borders.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want a few songs from each album play and our fans a good and versatile repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">She never repeats your repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I believe that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs can play. Each like another song, so the decision, which we will play is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="34">If we have two or three songs that we no longer have long played into the repertoire, we can maintain our focus better and they come as a surprise to us, because they remind us of the reasons why we have these songs, otherwise they could be forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this Tour celebrates its exporters twenty years of history.</seg>
<seg id="37">If you look back, you find it hard to believe in your success?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, total.</seg>
<seg id="39">First of all, I believe that none of us are presented in a great rock band to play, and over 20 years, which looks like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We are also continuing to this blessing and find it great to still be able to make music together.</seg>
<seg id="41">Let us and we are excited about music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are lucky to be able to go places in the world, which we have always wanted to visit again.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What was it for you, at the birth of Grunge participated actively?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It has always been an honour to this group of large band.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are good with the people of Sound Guard, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising and rather unusual, if a movement from a group of friends.</seg>
<seg id="48">Occasionally, a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups at the same time in the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and feel honoured, part of the Seattle-group.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes we are still together.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Guard at the Tour. We look forward, still to be friends with all of them and it is to our credit, part of this Seattle-Sounds that have arisen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is very unusual for a band like the companies with the same musicians together for so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago to us. This alone is much more time than many band survive.</seg>
<seg id="54">First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to still be alive and we care about each other.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all close friend why musical avenues that each individual freedom to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="56">The other is a familiar and whose music. It could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, konntet their thanks to your success always do what you wanted a.</seg>
<seg id="58">How is a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The way we are grown, has made it easier to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are certainly not too often on Tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">Until you consider that the people because of the music, it reminds you that you are the music and what it has created, must respect without hell-bent a famous rock star. It has never interested anyway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">What memories you have in your other project Mother Love bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think we have very good songs written and at the beginning, it was great.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were a band for three years, until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never issued a record.</seg>
<seg id="65">We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), with the band were friends, when I hear a song or photos, I think of what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work together to laugh and music and football, and many other issues.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The domestic bond Las Robertas are for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">Is it true that she knows their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and the band have chosen for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and the band liked best. That is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live. This is exciting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why does the text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.</seg>
<seg id="72">He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he chooses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Bassist and by whom you got to be affected?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">By so many +</seg>
<seg id="75">Among the first to come to mind include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many that I have the whole afternoon on the Bassisten, I like to talk about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How has it Pearl Jam managed to keep alive the Grunge, although it is not a fad?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When I think about it, the band that I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney, Sound Guard, Nirvana and everyone else who was at the same time, if they still are important, I think it is great, because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album, which might seem a bit lightly, but there are other songs such as The End or Just Breathe as a very dark songs, even though they have something positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both came to me to tears when I heard they played as Ed. There are very dark songs.</seg>
<seg id="84">I believe that if you are older and something drastic happens in your life - for example, if you have a family member or a friend loses, it affects your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs embody the clear for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">However, I also believe that it is a happy person and still dark music.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects, apart from the disputes over the fees with the tender.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The urban tender on 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola again in Barcelona.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now missing Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration on the promotion of their Schmähschrift Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was even in figures with the Central Park in New York in comparison.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and below (Sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The classification Collserolas plays as a natural park with this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now no longer served as an example of Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of Yogibärs.</seg>
<seg id="10">So far, it was when the city in September a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates after Collserola purported.</seg>
<seg id="11">Undoubtedly, a gateway to the concept of a park.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either that, or someone has, gates to the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The tender is not only from the organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste in the lift,.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it is this fact provides the fuel for a rare coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona, think about it, and some university professors who have applied to the project.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It is necessary for Roldán," after the attack on the coast on the "front in the mountains", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, were not held.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We should start from the principle that Barcelona largest park of the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, because it is easily accessible.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, "expresses the architect, for the title of" gates of Collserola "a" lexikalische case ": We must not" as access to a park, but as a limit of areas where action is needed. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol how Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as an "intellectual challenge," the "some risks".</seg>
<seg id="23">Risks due to the "uncertainty, the creation of a public space today brings" after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of the Forum their "swan song".</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is its own limits on what can be developed.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Something is always limit, the next step down", i.e. to exceed it.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [in response to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Modol, which is close to the issue, says simplifies the side of Collserola towards Valle Ana, "can be understood as a park towards Barcelona not" for purely topografischen reasons.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol recalls that there is already a study of Patronat de Collserola which are not "should fall on deaf ears," even though he was grateful to the City, his body has given the opportunity, on this project, "from the first moment".</seg>
<seg id="29">In addition, it says that the proximity of the mountain to the city of Geleitbrief is that it allows the architects of the debate, although his "doubt" to say whether this technical profile launched the multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says, "We architects should only be a tool."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because in the tendering conditions a global view of Collserola lacks: "There were 16 contests in the cross-cutting tender," he says, "on the axis mountains and sea, but there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."</seg>
<seg id="31">That, at least in his case meant that he participated in the 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors also collide.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his view, the city should absolutely guarantee that the Strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length so, a soft transition between city and green zones.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Would the signs that the effective, respected, it would not be necessary, nearly 200,000 blow holes to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of Asphaltbelags if appropriate, the number of blow holes significantly reduced or even completely avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his presentation "blow holes from a technical point of view," he to mark the International Year of Chemistry, he was aware that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte developing similar to the asphalt mix, but greater mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and the incidence of blow holes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He said that the asphalt, the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link, part of which has a high Molekulargewicht - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene together, they give the effective his typical zähelastisches behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Zähelastisches behaviour of Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of nearly 180 ° C as a liquid, at 120 ° C, it is very tough liquid and nearly 50 ° C, while he is fragile at very low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not uniform, but on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations changes," led the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researchers the FQ said, the streets of Mexico City had a flexible effective by a majority of six material classes together, of which the last three asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the top layers would wear a layer of asphalt from small, asphalt gebadeten there and then entrenched stones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each piece this decay class, whether in asphalt gebadet.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the vehicles travel and forces that produced this class provides a good forces in the effective distribution.</seg>
<seg id="13">"If it modified asphalt, would distribute the forces is even better," said the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"On the wear class," he tells us, "will make a final class, the so-called Tragschicht from tiny stones, i.e. from sand, also in asphalt gebadet.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since this class in contact with the car tyres, they need greater mechanical power than the wear and it must produce friction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This effective receives the most forces and distributed the Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is, must be maintained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The weather conditions, in particular, humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be taken into consideration, above all the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of wear class.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the site is wet, filthy water in the class and is just difficult again. This causes a softening of all sections of the road surface and, as a result, the incidence of blow holes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If a blow hole occurs, "he said," will begin the deck class City during the wear class only then will be affected, but the damage was not immediately, but it is a process that at the first sign of proper maintenance programmes should be maintained. "</seg>

<seg id="1">What was the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of the factors that this sector that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia did not.</seg>
<seg id="3">El Valle receives his 14th Miss title.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the award of the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the winners podium, a silver crown and the band, expelling them as new Miss Colombia, on the show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result that night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar in itself, it's Department is already at 14 Miss title and Melina is required by the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, almost in the hands of the crown. The proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The big question today, many are asking is what was missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the result is in line with the decline of a big favorite in every projection had shown that they had all the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing the Queen of the police and the Rostro Jolie of vogue Mejor elected titles, including the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor, as it applies to the decision of the jury, they failed to appoint the first is that the answer to the question "What book has the most impact on you and why?" She of Martín Gómez Carreta Literaria Leamos by Murillo was not convinced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The young woman from Valle del Cauca the author replied:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot, I think quite to the literature, I believe it is a kind of become more civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book, which for most shaped my childhood," The small Prince 'is a very deep book.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the moment, I read "crime and Punishment ', it is a book of universal culture that we all should read: I read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book that' passion 'means.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">One answer, which met with skepticism, firstly because of the term 'more civilised' and, secondly, because it does not specifically said how each of them had influenced their 'book.</seg>
<seg id="14">But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, calm and to feel happy with the outcome, "the universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for all people: Please read a bit of 'The small Prince', it is a great book.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among other things, it is said that the favourite of El Valle ausgebrannt.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favourite, all Beifälle einheimste and in the run-up to all prices was given (gastronomy competition Oster, audience vote on the best handgeschneiderte matches and Reina Madre), "jealous of the other candidates had made what the Queen stresste, therefore not shine on the stage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As we noted in its first presentation in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two lifts in the coronation ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although they both appeared safe, it lacked the strength and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico display.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "como en casa 'in RCN Channel said that the fact that Melina was crowned the Miss," shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, but not Queen. "</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle at the end of the press from the road - an error.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valle the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, which ultimately could not persuade the essence of the National beauty contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">There must be a reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were a woman for the social affairs of their country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty alone is enough for a Miss Colombia. We must look beyond the physical and social sense, insist that they even before the participation in the competition had worked on projects," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There is also speculation that Valle with its defects of Derriere and fibrosis, her in the stomach area noted, had sinned. But this is controversial, because the jury chose it as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina not the best body that it better, "but the problem with the fibrosis belly, which for me, to be honest, hard to say was, put their point number on the last day."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca had the surgery, which they had been subjected to.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should let them correctly.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her body has never been their strong side, and this point she had to pay. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Because of this prize, for the first time by the National beauty contest that arose after the appearance in bathing suit a cruel prediction in the night should be true. It was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize, so they do not enjoy the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina today their rule year, not as the Queen, but as a princess, a position that it offers the possibility of appointing the National beauty contest Colombia in international competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it will be one of the queens, despite its overwhelming outburst of Cartagena escaped the crown was to go down in history.</seg>

<seg id="3">The work of these officials plays a key role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On 4 November was a Lophoskopist of investigative unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man of the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Revolucionarias de Colombia Armadas - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI, had Eliazar González call this week, a man from the Puerto Tejada for 21 years in criminal investigations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career working in communities of Chocó González, where he often five days in the jungle had to go in order to achieve the place where the bodies were that he should identify.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In the week of the use of the so-called Alfonso Cano was Eliazar pointed out, put clothes for at least three days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nothing much awaited him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Friday night, he flew by helicopter from Palmira after Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="11">He knew he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, could be, so he should the ten finger-Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">But with the Untersuchungste when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because this was the images that he had seen in the media, not in the slightest.</seg>
<seg id="13">He had no beard, was dressed as a pawn of the area, no glasses and was very much thinner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But fingerprints don't lie.</seg>
<seg id="15">Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a lamp and a pocket Pflanzkelle Eliazar compared with the fingerprints of the corpse on the Abdruckblatt.</seg>
<seg id="16">He had seen right: It was "Alfonso Cano".</seg>

<p>
<seg id="19">For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali was the recognition that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano" paid, very important.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support investigations into accusations of murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the person arrested.</seg>
<seg id="23">In her arrest many criminals are false identity papers, or they are not.</seg>
<seg id="24">We are taking the fingerprints and are looking for these in the database.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The researchers told us that he is in a theft of a piece of wall had to pull out of a house, because the thief had precisely at this point with his hand when he was a aufgestützt with jewellery and money full gestopften Safe herauszog.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Walls are difficult because their surface for fingerprinting are inadequate, but in this case we have the imprint of the whole hands and the offender, who had participated in several thefts, identify," he recalled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">With the help of fingerprints can also be exonerated or murder suspects.</seg>
<seg id="28">Recently, one death, surrounded by bottles of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="29">The investigation was suspected that a family member tatverdächtig could be, and indeed was a fingerprint on the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although this does not guarantee that the murderer, so it is with the place where the offence was committed in context.</seg>

<seg id="31">A Daktyloskopist of CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen the object."</seg>
<seg id="32">When they appear, a Pflanzkelle or a band on the carriage.</seg>
<seg id="33">The prints are then sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to Personenstandamt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The problem is that there are still many Colombians are undocumented," said the expert from the CTI.</seg>
<seg id="35">He said that not everything is as it in the TV series presented SCI.</seg>

<seg id="2">The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real trouble.</seg>
<seg id="3">The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has prevailed in the autumn, in particular to those activists enough that the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Bureau of the European Commission proposed presidential motion was adopted almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">Under 1001 delegates had just nine voted against ten had abstained from the vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The standing ovation lasted several minutes because of their Interventionserlässen first, Angela Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen from the three Euro-minded finance minister, no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main idea of Chancellor - as well as the Antrage - following slogan: The answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe peace means, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly from the euro."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Chancellor is "time for a breakthrough in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="10">This could be through the control of the European Union, reinforcing the overhaul of the Lisbon Treaty in terms of budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone, and this could be expressed in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote resulted "in order to give Europe a face."</seg>
<seg id="11">However, this is definitely one of the request for proposals approved by Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.</seg>

<seg id="12">Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 rapidly in this revolution some: Groβ Britain is opposed to the cause, and the chief of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.</seg>
<seg id="13">The milestone, however.</seg>
<seg id="14">Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority of the proposal of the weighting of each country in the Governing Board under the weight of individual economies rejected what appears to be an awakening of Germany's position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To reassure the climate within their party thoughtful Chancellor has therefore reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, it has not tried to their Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty to win, which would criticise the arrogant Germany immediately.</seg>
<seg id="16">As far as the Euro-application of the importance of "Franco-German friendship" a clause, Angela Merkel, France is not on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="17">At least not directly.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because this recalls that Leipzig two centuries ago in the heart of a bloody battle.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">After the family subsidies are now sick UMP and government reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux, a family allowance to pay and a speech on this - since 2007, been recurrent theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">To accompany this attack by the desire, the economy is in a tough test, on the other hand, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, wants the majority of workers ill reports.</seg>
<seg id="5">Start with the economic objectives: The government is seeking the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking a sick notification of workers in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In plain English, this means that a sick workers without the approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of their monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Maβnahme which, according to the newspaper, "Les echoes" provoke anger, however, would help to 280 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">And with a different Maβnahme rather symbolic nature go hand in hand: The state officials a unvergüteten Karenztag event for the disease (so far are there for them, in the three Karenztagen Gegensatze in the private sector, no Karenzfrist).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, in the discussion of these issues are also cranked up the majority of the fraud issue, this time on the abuse is associated with Arbeitsabsenz targeted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Checks will be far more important, and furthermore, these rückzuvergüten, if that is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the impact of this news about the reality of fraudulent activity in the areas of ill requests a little unproportioniert.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is, in fact, already the subject of constant observation since 2002 and political offensive operations, the most commonly have borne fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are not sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But first we dwell on the nationwide paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the country were CNAM health insurance fund in 2006, more than EUR 237 million days compensation paid off.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Gemäβ of Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care, the days of compensation in 2008 with 11.3 billion euro 5% of health spending.</seg>
<seg id="17">This figure fell 46% on maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% on Krankheitsurlaube that heiβt 6.2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">And therefore, 2.5% of health spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, on average, only 14.5 sick days.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average of concealing certain differences: Another in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40,000, French workers said, no single Krankentag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another, this time from the health insurance covered study makes it clear that 37% of ill requests in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend not more than elsewhere, inability to work.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2010, the two researchers of the French, the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) led long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001 global Absenzquote (justified) oszillierte away or otherwise, in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud in ill reports is a tiny proportion of undeclared work.</seg>
<seg id="25">With regard to the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 2002, encouraging the legislation means that it controls on sick systmatische reports, the 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the lost 285 of past, short-term sick reports that heiβt in 37,050 cases, "unjustified or too long."</seg>
<seg id="28">The systematic controlled ill reporting cases of more than 45 days in duration was 1.2 million 11% of "unangepassten or unjustified" cases, the heiβt 132,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Overall, this is 169,000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who made an ill.</seg>
<seg id="30">A paragraph that only a weak Ausmaβ compared with, for example, those of undeclared work represents.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the UMP deputies Dominique Tian, author of a published in July Sachberichts regarding this issue, this is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax earnings per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus far more than the Defraudation at last.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian company is living in a state of denial about the death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9% of Canadians are really important, with their doctor to talk about conditions under which they wish to die and making arrangements for this purpose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, in the six experts were involved in a variety of disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine, are interlinked.</seg>
<seg id="7">This body recommends the government to amend the penal code so, in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election is, in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent company EIU, the death of Erdballes quality in 40 countries had compared with each other.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada is placed in the 10th grade, the study noted that "the rate of health care in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to raise the subject of death."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medical care or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so tell us which of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts.</seg>
<seg id="11">And despite the majority of Canadians who wish to die at home, but ultimately die 68.6% of those in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">Across the country, the rate is viewed with 86% of deaths that occurred in hospital in Quebec.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the sensitive question about euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the authors of the report's conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert, no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, to make concessions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But now, according to the experts who have inspected gleichermaβen all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide legalised decriminalising or have no proof that such a decriminalisation Miβbräuche in its application, the practice of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten or non-consenting persons.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, we meet a lot more cases of such violations, particularly in countries where begleiteter suicide legalised euthanasia and not, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report, in a teleconference.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">What maintenance or cessation of resources in patients, the situation is less clear, as the author of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">They also lay in its recommendation list suggests that the criminal law should be indicated that the possibility of funds for a legal opposition have not been as criminal should apply.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts in the field of health care already have reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Council Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health care law, has signed the attitude of the report, among other things, experts as "extreme", as this practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stages have no borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone who lives tired and older than 18 years, another person to ask him in his suicide to help," Deschamps Council yesterday a summary of the report had looked at.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Under Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticised for a number of points, police, judicial and administrative bodies because of the figures that have undergone a policy of reconciliation of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France itself was heading.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recently, the anti-harassment of official foreign students look at the weekend, the Home Secretary had a passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France "no talent, a bricklayer or waiter from abroad was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="4">But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On this issue, there is a wide consensus between right and left.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tone of right-wing side has been dented by Jacques Chirac, the 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, no problem for a country should be," from left-wing side by Michel Rocard, 1990, France "could not accommodate all the poverty of the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference is the level of Groβzügigkeit</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumber was in 2005 on both the right and the left.</seg>
<seg id="9">From both camps were immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is the extent to which the Groβzügigkeit, the immigrants is willing to admit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Francois Hollande is limited in its programme to banalities, say, partnership development will allow it, our "migration problems".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem that could potentially have an impact on the election; but it is economically costly.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the economy Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book, the latest findings on the immigration together (exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the experts about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.</seg>
<seg id="14">Limit immigration would weaken growth and the labour market situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Fears over the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that these threats, the local workforce, particularly the less qualified, to be replaced by pressure exerted on their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows, however, that the immigrants in reality much complementary than when the local wage workers, since they schwerpunktmäβig jobs in sectors that are technically unausgelastet job.</seg>
<seg id="17">The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors, the local wage workers little comment, the better among immigrants working in dynamic sectors where the training is not the labour supply converged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Positive wage effect</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As a surgeon difficulties would have to work in a country where there is a shortage of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between natives and immigrants have a positive effect of Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni peri in this way has calculated that a 1% disabled rising flood of immigrants a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9% only.</seg>
<seg id="21">And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward the immigrants creation and economic growth is conducive (high proportion eingebürgerter immigrants under American Nobel laureates, Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Net migrants also contribute to the social systems, in European countries, for example, on average, for a total of 1% of the total budget.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years after Germany einwandernde person the public budget on average about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of about 150,000 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start of his mandate, the lack of disciplinary issues "with the teeth."</seg>
<seg id="25">They said teeth, which should deter immigrants, however, reached exactly the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="3">It is gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted this event with pomp and circumstance.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 directors, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, Russia and Germany below sea level.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolic way along the tax of Ventils turned what the Russian gas to Western European network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres per year extra Russian gas through a pipeline of 1,224 km from the region of Saint Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, supplied to Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second pipeline, which is a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption -, is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it is already the possibility of building a third transmission route referred to themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion point this enormous Bauwerkes as a victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project was in Poland and the Baltic States highly controversial.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any links course by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) across the continent.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, these two countries will lose some of their power: It is now more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia, by threatening to access to Western European markets to close down.</seg>
<seg id="14">Warsaw, most in the debate, has not shied away from the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new Franco-German and tables pact" in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuβerst.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe has the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">But at the expense of starvation of European energy, because the project a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has finished in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong Gasverbrauche and their gas reserves are becoming exhausted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects to organic way," confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the groβen Gasverträge by political and economic side are important.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of this explains the broad smile of Lubmin number of Gazprom managers in terms of Gaszuleitung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this pipeline is also a prominent technology.</seg>
<seg id="22">The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete shelter, which is intended to protect them from Schiffsankern.</seg>
<seg id="23">It rests on the seabed, in approximately 200 metres depth.</seg>
<seg id="24">In its construction from the Second World War had previous minefields be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">Auβerdem Maβnahmen had increased to protect fauna and flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The pipeline is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: Either through valves or maintenance stations.</seg>
<seg id="28">A Kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have held back from since the Swedes were not keen, a Russian state company on permanent way to match its coasts located.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the event of an accident close down the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," clarified Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">Hole in the event of a leak in the pipeline owned gas in the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">In this case, however, the designers probably regarded as little as Schweiβnähte on a consistency of a leak was estimated per 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The state monitoring of the gas pipeline, both from a submarine robots, the external surveillance purposes from being driven by a place, as well as from a device which circulates within the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">It has the shape of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, will be introduced in the interior of the pipeline and the gas pressure continued.</seg>
<seg id="34">After three full days of moving through the pipeline at a speed of 3 metres per second, the device in his arrival provides detailed information on possible deformations of metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pipeline was designed for fifty years, without the slightest undergo repairs.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is 200 cash to the Zutritts, 100 cash to the exit point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have their forces on the implementation of this project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, the 51% of the shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">Furthermore, the German companies E. on and BASF (ever attached to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and French firms group GDF Suez (ever to 9%).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, and with the construction and operation of the pipeline is commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is located in Zug in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.</seg>
<seg id="43">The company Gazprom, then the entire capacity of their Gastransportes hired out on renewable Twenty-year contract.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how groβ Gasmenge from transporting the real one," clarified Jens Müller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the gas pipeline construction was to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The entire labour costs should be to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, the investment, for example, 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">But the minority shareholders are gewiβ to recoup its expenses, because Gazprom alone the liability risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The pipeline is on a sandy, with pine forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.</seg>
<seg id="50">The 4.5-metre high valves are the Gasaustrittspforte.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of gas before arriving in the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, this terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies verstreichende per hour.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Approximately 19% of disabled people to find a job.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, "the 15th week of work for the disabled."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite a determined public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people always twice the average middle value: Arbeitlosigkeit 19% to 9% of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Discouraging?</seg>
<seg id="6">"No, Éric said Blanchet, director-general of the Association of Adapt" week of work for the disabled "liberal."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The progress made within 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="8">"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to do."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It must be said, however, that for disabled unemployed still many obstacles remain before they get a job.</seg>
<seg id="11">More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no A-levels and there are only 10,000 disabled under the 2.3 million students with higher education qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, the long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled to 38% in the overall average.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult for a new work a rose, and the "heart of the problem is," Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So much for the factual brakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">The underlying implication, the spirit of attitudes, certainly, but slow to develop.</seg>
<seg id="17">One in April by the Association of IMS-entreprendre et for the magazine La Cité study, which surveyed managers have "a weak knowledge levels on the disabled," the "over-represented" was "of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually less well-off."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which enshrined in an Act of 1987,.</seg>
<seg id="19">The latter, originating from the 2008 figures point to a ratios of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We are now in the 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is charged with recovering contributions from companies that violate the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The evidence: The number "fees zahlender" plants, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, and from 59,000 zahlenmäβig at 46,000 (and on 606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"This Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this improvement is also a real insight, especially the groβen firms groups."</seg>
