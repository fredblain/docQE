Europe invented the democracy, remains now to think out the European democracy
Democracy is some valuable goods; also some sensitive goods.
The European continent is supposed to be able to remember on that, who had issue let the entire 20th century after its invention in the Athens before more than two thousand years over the tragedy of the first world war, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonel in Greece over itself.
Some's probably had believed, it rich from to exercise the right to vote, and to be sure on most directly possible type and manner in order to see be victorious the democracy a for all times over its enemies.
One knows since Napoleon" the small" that it concerned a feature of the spirit bearing.
The general right to vote, that represents necessary condition of the democracy, is for this not sufficient condition and can become just as good that" suppression instrument" how it at that time the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed.
No, democracy requires by far more: a public room, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and inspection of the forces, an education, clarification, economic and social partnership spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find us, is an economic crisis, but it is just as very and first of all politics crisis and democracy crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek Wahr-incorrectly-referendum would have had doubly informative character in this regard: once that of the necessity of a powerful return the politics, on the other side however also that the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its impropriety.
This ambivalence should be considered as outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle shifted themselves today, and that the republican soldiers aim, or at least that of them, no longer into the correct direction.
We have nothing to win in order to press on a success of the domestic referendum, which was organized in dependence of the necessities and in wrong sequence.
A free certificate for the European alone ruler or a leap with connected eyes into the void of the nationalistic withdrawal: A choice for the citizen!
No, we want hoe hatchet, but rather a collective task, out of full right, clarified and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time on European level.
There are gives no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one knows in the remaining already no longer, where the list to conclude - there it only a single crisis, and this rules in Europe.
It is entirely Europe, that bends itself the dictation of the markets and the Ratingagenturen, that suffers from its faint and its solidarity deficiency.
It is entire Europe that is humbled on more international plain.
One is disturbed over sovereignty transfer toward Europe - at the same time is it entire Europe that loses gradually its sovereignty, and therewith each single of the nations incorporated it.
The urgency exists therein to give the sovereignty of the people of the leadership of the European project back at the hand.
For it is lain at the entirety whether the Europeans reduce the load of its guilt, of the markets freely make itself and develop can a future by investments.
The exit out of the crisis has decisions on European level to the condition, that does not please will can without total democratic, without leading us very certainly into the ruining.
After this suggestion was fought by Jacques Delors and the socialist long time over, every presses today the European economy leadership in addition.
Agreed.
To imagine but this without political integration and a stronger democracy - like it the citizens floats before -, a renewed folly and a further dead end would be.
We must take a new stage of European construction on us.
In order let emerge in France the republic, needed it the fact to "to create" republican.
The revolution of the interests alone could not would suffice perform here.
This instruction remains further valid.
We must form an on Europe better integrated more economically plain.
This only can be reached, politically seen creates in that one a more democratic Europe, a genuinely European sovereignty of the people.
We need European in order to create Europe.
