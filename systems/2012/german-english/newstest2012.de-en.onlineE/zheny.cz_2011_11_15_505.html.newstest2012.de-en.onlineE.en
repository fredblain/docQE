The worst feminine vices: How stand it with you?
If one requests the men in addition to name some typical feminine vices, they shake without exception some promptly out of the sleeve.
Love women, you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we again happen let a couple Unsitten review, that let seethe the men the blood in the veins?
Purchase that which is sought
Does its spouse reproach them to be purchase addicted?
Must you weekly buy yourself at least a Hader?
Go you shopping gladly and may be it in actions also a little more?
Then it concerns in your trap probably really a weakness.
Many women are themselves its at least aware and try to hold its purchase desire half-way under control.
Does but hand on the heart, which woman it endure already to stroll in search of a well sitting outer clothing only so through a dress business and not to try itself immediately all (in all possible color combination) in the cabin?
Also if the shopping is for most women a hobby, for the men it is often the pure hell.
If they consider already said have yet once, like often it to its man - shelter you once rather outside...
Permanent discontent
Am I "not too thick"?
Would "I have to decrease at least five kilos - should I begin to make" to joggen or gymnastics?
Do I "please you generally"?
Does that occur them somehow well known?
Yes?
Then you belong possessed are probably also to the women, that regular therefrom how they look.
That is by far that you go letting should yourself, but many men react allergicly on that if its woman complains permanently over its appearance.
The stronger sex is itself united - with increasing frequency of the troubles are the women always more incompatible.
Order and neatness at first place
It is a battle against windmill.
Polish windows, wipe tiles and dust, scour the tub - and this at least twice in the week.
Do you scold with its partner because he tramples again once with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you scold the children because the just scoured sink already again dirtily is and because the glass door has at the living room closet already again fingerprints, where yet the polishing so much effort makes?
If you should suffer from this type "Devianz", you should know that one may exaggerate nothing and the order and neatness in family life do not take precedence.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can in the end also the mutual relations and above all the quiet in the family damage.
Sting el
"Dirty gymnastics pairs of pants come into the wash basket".
Do you "want to dress" the old socks really tomorrow yet once?
One does not throw "a wet towel simply on the floor".
If your partner of such a harangue is stopped, you may not be surprised that it that brings on the palm tree.
That is clear meant not bad, it want yet only, that of all its order has.
If the men knew this, the women needed possibly not so much to moan.
Clap and gossip
Many women claps and gossip gladly because becomes behind the back whispered or quite slanders or forges one alliances.
Women are focused now once on relations, therefore they comb gladly such subjects through, like for example - who where, with whom, like and why.
Probably each of us women has a clap little harmless and gossip in stock.
Hand on the heart - that is well own of all women.
That is not to be confused despise however with clap aunts of coarsest caliber, whom nothing and no one is holy, that probably every in its environment and represent that especially for woman collective a considerable danger.
