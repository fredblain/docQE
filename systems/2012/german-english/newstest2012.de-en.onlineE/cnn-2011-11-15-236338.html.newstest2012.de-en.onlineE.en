Urgent warnings out of the Pentagon before possible incisions in the defense being
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta heated the congress on Monday on when he warned before that, that automatic budget abridgments would weaken the national security unseen. Therewith it released a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon thinks out already abridgments in height of 450 trillion dollar in the course of the coming decade, fears now however that further abridgments can become around 600 trillion dollar or more necessary, if the congress can obtain no conclusion in the editions.
"The effects of these abridgments would be devastating for the ministry", wrote Panetta in a letter to the republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
It said, would lead a failure of the congress in the obtaining of a budget agreement what will lead to a so-called seizure, to 23% general abridgments as well as a stop of numerous new projects.
"Such one high abridgment, carried out on such inconsiderate type and manner, would become that of our ship projects and building projects unworkable make - you cannot three-quarters of a ship or a building buy - and other modernization efforts seriously damage", wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would be forced moreover to separate us involuntary from a large part of our civil personnel and because the reduction so quickly would be transferred, must we with at security of bordering probability civilians beurlauben in order to can" reach the goal.
"These changes would destroy the belief of those, uprightly would be received that our military and seriously damage" our alarm readiness.
The abridgments became encounter in the end the battle troops", said Panetta.
"During the wartime units in the anti-terrorist battle through the seizure not directly concerned are, would become the serious intervention into the reason budget the war efforts disadvantageously influence", warned Panetta.
"Personnel attitudes were shortened become, what would become" lead delays in the attitudes and the attitude supervision, that support the war.
"The salaries of the personnel would be shortened, what leads to late payments at wartime dealer and disturbed" would be the legal like also political support.
Panetta answered both senators 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic abridgments on the defense ministry.
"The consequences of a seizure of the defense ministry would initiate" a fast decline of the United States as a leading military power of the world.
"We are vehement against this draconian action", said the senators in a joint explanation on Monday afternoon when they published Panettas letter.
"This is is a result with which we cannot live, and it certainly no that one should" impose us.
"The seizure is not should become" a threat of the national security interests the united place and its entering allowed.
To exempt whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or demands will reinforce, the Pentagon from abridgments, remains to await.
Panetta expressed increasingly blunt the possible abridgments although it was able to gather many years experiences with the budget in the congress and in the white house, before it came at the tip of the Pentagon, and knows that it stands vis-Ã -vis heavy decisions.
On a press conference in the past week, the Minister of Defense painted be forthcoming could a gloomy picture, what - a military with shell, but without kernel.
"It is a ship without sailor".
"It is a brigade without ammunition".
"It is a Luftwaffengeschwader without sufficiently educated pilots".
"It is a paper tiger, an army of the barracks, building and bombs without sufficiently educated soldiers, that in a position are, the mission to fulfill", said Panetta in its opening talk in the Pentagon.
"It is a dispute power, that it lacks at moral and alarm readiness and that is not in a position, to receive" it with potential opponents.
"You lets become" one actually furiously.
In a supplement to its letters at McCain and Graham, Panetta cited creates new details, like reductions "significant strategic risks: Delays in periods of crisis, conflicts and catastrophes, serious restrictions of our worldwide use capacity and intervention capacity, what to an unacceptable risk in future war operations leads".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects of the deletion could fall victim, inclusive those who already were tested and be already in the early planning phase.
To this list, also the battle flyer belongs F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb airplane, the next generation of ballistic U boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground battle vehicle that Army and navy need in order to replace the Humvee.
If one would stop the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save in the next 10 years to 80 trillion dollar, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to the rearmament, so that possible dangers by China and other opponents banned will can.
