The general meeting should find a new chairperson - again threatens a stalemate.
Already almost for five months, the Czech soccer has no chairperson and at the same time threatens that the successor will not be of Ivan Hašek at the tip of the Czech soccer association once after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday well known in Nymburk.
Until today, there is namely yet no unification about that, after which election regulation selected will should.
And without this, no voting is generally possible over the three potential successors.
Three interested parties would like to manage the Czech soccer - Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá Paclík.
In June Hašek of its function resigned whereby it had requested its colleagues in the retirement in addition to agree and to find a strong personality, that could lead the soccer in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old arguments between both association chambers broke out again, that cannot agree on a joint candidate.
This appeared plainly and clearly on the 16th of September when the new chairperson should be selected.
The delegated of the general meeting had come very for nothing into the people house in the citizen of Prague quarter Smíchov, for the negotiation led to no result and at the same time it concerned not only the choice itself.
One was able to agree namely not even about that, is who in the full collection actual stimmberechtigt - only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries equipped with an authority.
In this single point, one obtained at least partially unification why also the recommendation of the institute contributed for country and right, whose opinion would not be after a representation admissible on authority basis.
The disputes around the election regulation last however further.
Also the Exekutivausschuss brought no longer clarity into the thing, in whose sessions - equal, whether orderly or extraordinary - in principle generally does nothing stand other more on the order of the day.
Also if the views changed with regard to the choice a couple of time - the neuralgic point remained the same.
Does the question read: how one should advance in the 3rd round in order to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue concerns the question, whether one in agreement with the statute advance should, or whether an entirely other model found will must", placed you at Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairperson the firmly, that represents the pro soccer in the management.
According to statutory model, that candidate, who receives the larger prozentuelle support in the chamber, wins in the third round, for which he runs for office.
Mähren is nominally ready to go in on the compromise that that candidate wins, who receives the higher number of votes out of both chambers.
The Czech side again insists on the condition that the victor receives at least a two-thirds majority in this prozentuellen voice counting.
"Then have both preliminaries generally no sense more, this mode would become the entire bicameral draft in question place", understands Svoboda the objections of the mährischen side that it would find best, that thereto do not bend election regulation, but rather to select according to valid statute.
Surprisingly also Tomá Paclík agrees that, also if is outlined, that the statutory election regulation of all candidates comes at that soon probably contrary to Pelta.
It is "my wish that most extensive after the statute selected becomes".
"Therewith no absurd replacement variants contrived become, how in the last general meeting", declared of the owners (the soccer club) Victoria of that for the first time runs for office and delimited itself in its attitudes above all vis-à-vis Pelta.
Pelta remains however optimistic.
According to its opinion the new chairperson will be well known in Nymburk and believes he that the candidates in the future will collaborate also constructive.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the soccer EM at the current day would contribute" certainly to calming of the minds.
"If the soccer first on the euphoric wave rides, is also the readiness for the collaboration larger", means the functionary out of Jablonec, that of all three Adepten the largest experiences brings along, and this both on professional and regional level.
Rajchl is there more reserved.
"I hope for a unification, but the situation is unfortunately conflicting".
"That is no thing between the people out of bohemian and Mähren, but there are bend right certain efforts, the directions to own purposes""."
A renewed blockage "therefore is not excluded" in the general meeting.
"I hope however, that the healthy common sense in the end wins", said Rajchl.
Only - much time to the agreement of all sides remains no longer.
Some negotiations should happen nominally directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the Fußballgeneralität will be generally complete to the qualification game.
The charter airplane, with which among other things Dalibor and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, was able to start searched at the morning in Prague because of a technical interference not at all and so one feverishly for a replacement variant to bring a part of the executive committee like one yet yet at the venue of the bar rage away game.
In the end is then yet well the meeting on minister plain decisively, to which it should come nominally on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for school system, youth and body upbringing would have moved the split parties within the largest sport association of the country gladly to a unification.
Much stands namely on the game: national grants that Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech soccer and also the standing general meeting should the that the Czech sport after the finance problems of Sazka the new direction of wise.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of the chairperson because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomá Paclík, that boss of the Pilsner soccer players would have been able to settle a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all its presentations over the new chairperson of the soccer association of the Czech republic, he would not have gotten involved at all with the fight for this top position.
"If there were a good applicant, I would fight for it and forgo" the choice.
"But in the present situation succeeded it not, such an Adepten to find", said Paclík.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Rajchl, is to be prevented it therefore that the alleged favorite of the choice, Pelta at which tip arrives the.
Paclík emphasizes also that it thought to exercise the function of the chairpeople in the case its victory only a year, therefore until 2013, to the appointment the general meeting orderly.
In the position of the chairperson, he would have learned seen gladly one Top manager, who is not entangled all too very into the soccer events.
"With some people coming in question, I personally spoke".
To believe "hardly that some said me, it did not want to identify itself presently with the Czech soccer.
"Such views gladly would have changed", led it on.
Most of everything, Paclík disturbs nominally the connection Pelta's it with the chairperson of the Pilsner of district soccer association novel Berbr, a man with controversial call, who counts behind the scenery as a powerful lobbyist, to influence with the capacity, Delegiertenabstimmungen on general meetings.
For Paclík, it is for this reason unacceptable that Pelta would have the position of the chairpeople in.
"In its victory, the current condition would be preserved on and in the Czech soccer, it would not go at all ahead".
"The support through Berbr, a clever Businessman, would get the soccer doubly badly", emphasized Paclík.
With this it alludes also on that that Pelta's it name fell some time ago in connection with Telefonabhörungen to the ascertainment in a corruption affaire, out of which Pelta followed however exempt.
"I does not know, which prestige a victory of Pelta that (tsch.) Soccer bring in should".
"And how would become we in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA stand there", said Paclík, that its earlier statement, "it would become the Pilsner soccer club sell, if Pelta chairperson would become", but already something calm sees.
If Paclík in the Thursday choice should win, he thoroughly could imagine however a future collaboration with Pelta.
Just as also a further candidate thinks - Rajchl, that Paclík had supported before the general meeting in October, that ended with a fiasco.
"It (Pelta) would be go would become" the first, that I.
"It has large capacities".
"I could introduce" me it well for example as a boss of the national team.
"But I do not believe that it is able, to lead" the association as a manager.
"I stick my nose yet not in matters, of which I would nothing understand", said Paclík, that had provided in September therewith for sensation, that it stood behind the recall of the arbitrator commission with Macela at the tip, that Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík itself maintains, it would feel grown the roll of the association chairpeople.
And has called at the same time on its capacities in the direction of private firms, for past summer is itself it also boss of Pilsen who celebrated with its support in May the first triumph in the league.
"I have the Power in addition to change something in the soccer milieu and to contribute" to one certain cultivation of this.
"Around the influence of certain interest groups to restrict, that in addition tend, disciplineed commissions and calling commissions to influence, what into repulsive situations degenerates", cited Paclík, that makes no Hehl out of its antipathy for example vis-à-vis the Sparta boss Daniel.
As one its priorities it would look at the establishment of the relations between that and the Czech Olympia committee, with whose aid it would become lobbyieren at the political tip politicians for that, that more money flows out of the lottery tax into the sport.
"That is one of the decisive things which the new chairperson should" dedicate itself.
"If it to the taxation of games of chance comes, how the political parties declare, grasp I its argumentation, must it however also plainly and clearly say, where the money goes", said it.
Its connection to the Pilsner club does not look at Paclík either as a Handicap although he himself emphasizes, the chairperson the would must "non-partisan" be.
Pelta again is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the citizen of Prague Dukla.
"That is not exactly ideal".
"It makes my opinion however also not much sense, my shares in the Pilsner club hypocritical on a third person to transmit, around after one and a half years again to return", placed Paclík clearly.
Pelta promised would exclude new statutes the the one stalemate situation in the future.
One of the candidates promised strongly would make itself two days before the general meeting of the soccer association for the Vorsitzendenamt, namely Miroslav Pelta, he in the case its choice for that that the new Statute gets, that in the future disputes exclude over the election regulation from the start.
The functionary out of Jablonec is the Thursday ago negotiation in Nymburk confident and believes, the campaign certainly would defuse itself in a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised already before the not realized choice in September, he wanted concentrate in the case its choice on the national team and the winning of finance means.
He decided liked to help first on the last moment to be involved in the choice before the last general meeting and so it the two-month recess to defend its presentations over the direction of the soccer and to introduce in a wider context.
"People on all levels dedicate themselves to the soccer, they are impatient and expect therefore that the chairperson will be" on Thursday well known.
"It feels that it is highest time, that the association is led by someone, means the man, who is connected above all with the Jablonecer club, that acted however also many years in Sparta and in the Exekutivausschuss.
Also therefore it means that it would control sufficient experiences in order to lead the Czech soccer.
It is convinced that for the current problems with the choice the euphoria is responsible, that at times of Ivan Hašek ruled.
"Unfortunately statutes were approved in the general meeting in June, were not so perfect that how it had supposed everyone.
If they had not permitted different interpretations, we would have had as of September already a chairperson", meant Pelta.
It used just the revision of the most important document of the citizen union as an enticement for the delegated.
I "should become chairperson, I take myself its personally on and am to bear ready personally responsibility if it out" does not work.
"That is a fundamental thing, without that it be not can", maintains Pelta.
In the further, he does not try to delimit himself vis-à-vis its contractors.
Already earlier it had announced, could imagine it a collaboration with Rajchl, that it acknowledges because of its juristic development and good knows it, that its against candidate would be its first representative.
It attacked also Tomá Paclík already long no longer, let that again no dry thread at Pelta.
In the soccer moved he herself already over a year and can refer already to certain successes".
"Its attacks were however reducing and many people were of its choice campaign shocked".
"Also therefore doubt now many its actual character", addressed Pelta its contractor, that would remain well faithful to its Proklamierungen, that it already in September expressed have.
According to its opinion its strongest weapon is the knowledge of the soccer of the lowest game classes, up to the national team.
And this should be the hallmark of Czech soccer.
"I would strive me also therefore to conclude all affaires - of the Causa Bohemians, up to the reverberations of the corruption scandal of the past year".
"Equally after that would become I me on negotiations with the private and national sector fall, around sufficient finance means for the entire soccer to guarantee", said the six and forty year old candidate two months ago.
At that time it promised also that its entrance would mean no personnel cleansings into the tip of the Czech soccer.
"I must me first once with the work contents of all employed trusted make", said it toward Strahov where based on the long anarchy understandably nervousness rules.
In spite of the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the standing general meeting, it believes that the delegated do not go to the Thursday for nothing to Nymburk.
"If actual the single debatable point should be, how one selects in the third round, let's come about that away".
"The soccer needs credibility and that wins it only through it back, if it finally a new Leader has", remains Pelta two days the possibly decisive day ago its functionary career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that that begins to work under it hard
If the previous deputy chairperson Rajchl should be selected on the general meeting on Thursday to the new chairperson of the soccer association of the Czech republic, this would become alleged many people in the association the mood vermiesen.
Rajchl promises namely that one would begin to work in the case its choice hard.
It wants to introduce system changes and responsibly wants to make the members of the executive committee for single soccer areas.
Moreover it promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve the relations to the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the soccer and to continue otherwise the work, that the prior presiding Ivan Hašek began.
"As chairperson, I would like to dedicate" myself the soccer as entire.
Begun of the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, over the national selection, the professional soccer, up to the achievement soccer for the youth".
"Therewith wants I do not say, that I all alone make wants", said Rajchl in the conversation for.
"I am a team player and would like to distribute therefore the competences in the Exekutivausschuss so that each member dedicates" herself one certain to area.
And I will distribute hard tasks, make headway so that the soccer in every segment with mile step".
About that many would not be charmed just because they to criticize, instead of only the work of other to work now even really hard begin must", joined it thereto.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the soccer movement had pulled in deliberation to not to run for office more at all.
"Of me is well known that I work" 20 hours at the day.
"But I must know, that it sense makes and that people behind me stand, that me not incessantly club between the legs throw and every step, that I make, in question place", said he as an explanation why he had hesitated.
"Many people said however that I would not be allowed to abandon, to me because it would become" do otherwise also others.
"That is confidence, that one do not lose may", said it.
Nominally motivates it also to be allowed to continue the work, that it began under Hašek.
"In two years, we mastered a large piece of work and not simply want to throw away" that I now.
"It became processes started, that probably not until a couple of years the validity come and I only unwillingly would see, that it someone stop", it meant and expresses with this its objections that for the case, that the other candidate would be selected himself - Miroslav Pelta, that could return situation into the times before Hašek.
"I believe is in systematic action and that somewhat, what does not bring" Mirek Pelta.
"Behind it, people who would make the soccer so stand above all, that he would be" selected only for there.
One can reproach probably a few things for me, but would be partial not, that I".
"I strive me, objectively to its".
"I wants soccer for everyone, because it then all well goes and not only that selected", noted Rajchl.
It contradicts also the statement, let it be only a chairperson of the Czechs.
"Also if many people maintain the opposite to do" I have really before, the optimum for Mähren.
"For example it is to be considered time whether one should not subdivide the league in a Czech and a mährischen part, whose winners climbed" then respectively into the first league.
"Then could it do not happen, that today only three mährische club in the league play, what especially for the young players in Mähren a problem is", means Rajchl.
Because now also the boss of the Pilsner club Tomá Paclík joined to the fight for the function of the chairperson, Rajchl does not trust itself to estimate its chances that he is selected.
"I perceive a strong support in the Czech chamber, that me to its deputy chairperson selected has and now recognizes, that clear successes behind me stand", cited Rajchl, that also the savings of hesitated millions crowns for unfavorable contracts, that looks at agreement of TV contracts and the negotiations around the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand he gives himself in part the guilt that the association does not pull at a single cord.
While it says of Pelta, "it would be from the start disqualifies, the Czech soccer to new confidence in to help", holds it the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate, who has to offer really something to the soccer.
"No one can question that it has" performed excellent work in Pilsen into only a year.
"Should it selected become, would become it probably the things continue, that Ivan Hašek initiated has and also the personnel occupation in the commissions would become it obviously not basically change".
It would not want to bend there the things certainly to its favor", judges Rajchl over its rival.
