"The few policemen, that my knowledge incorporated became, knew not, that it around the Zuccotti park went", said someone, that anonymously would like to remain.
"The only that knew that it concerned the Zuccotti park, were the high-ranking officials of the department".
A reason for the secrecy was a lesson that had learned the city.
On the 14th of October, officials wanted to clear the park, were awake then however back when hundreds of protester came together, after these had learned of these plans.
Officials of different police units were involved in the operation of the Tuesday, among other things also use commands out of the entire city - hundred shafts of mobile officials that are used normally in highly criminal neighborhoods.

As itself the police toward west through the large disorder at personal things of the protester, among other things suitcase, art lawn and paper bags with dresses, moved, followed its employee of the city cleaning, that canceled, what had been put back.
Some protesters, that refused to go, were dragged after outside. Pictures hereof appeared already short time later on the Internet.
A head kernel of protester related position in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the warehouse in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued its methodical arrests.

The official most prominent on the spot was Joseph J. Esposito, the boss of the department, the official highest uniformed of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, department boss of the criminalists, was also there.
In spite of its presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead" "the operation" how Mr. Browne said.
For the case that they take action, waited a second group of official at the eastern side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar street.
In the Cortlandt streets, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine streets, a block further south, were erected barricade.
