Austria
Entry one" golden household rule" into the constitution
The government present itself in Austria at the power of the sozialdemokratischen/christdemokratischen coalition concluded on Tuesday to include one" golden household rule" in the constitution, in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid also a possible Degradation on the part of Rating agencies in the Top of creditworthiness Austria (AAA).
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann highly personally, that had announced this decision of the exit of the cabinet council, although the public Austrian country guilt is in 74.6%, therefore by far over the criterion fixed by the Maastrichter contract of 60%, however clearly beneath the guilt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"Would be the solvency of Austria not on a blow of AAA on AA + sunk, must we each year three billions of Euro interests in addition pay", argued Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and christian-democrater.
Austria grants also a demand the Brussels summit meeting of the members states of the Eurozone of the 26th of October: The heads of state and heads of the government would have demanded at that time the reception of the reduction of public deficits until end of the year 2012 as well as a return into the public account balance into the constitution or through directive of an equivalent law.
That to this of the Austrian government seized resembles that" German model" because Germany had been the first European country, that had included one" rule" in the constitution.
To the year 2017, the structural budget deficit should sink itself each year around 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP), should not exceed the structural budget deficit of the state the 0,35%-Grenze of the GDP from 2017 whereas the regional countries just as as the communities should show balanced households.
It is the goal of eliminating in the horizon of 2020/21 the household guilt under that through the 60 of %- criterion fixed Maastrichter come off.
