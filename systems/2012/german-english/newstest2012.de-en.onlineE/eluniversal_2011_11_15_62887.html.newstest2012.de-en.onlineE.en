MSS gives notice a research protocol for discovering the gene for obesity on
You social insurance institute of Mexico lead a research project for discovering the gene for obesity with children and youth, who is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (social insurance institute of Mexico) announced that it leads a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity with children and youth under the title "genetics of the obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers in connection with excess weight are supposed to be found.
Miguel Cruz López, leader of the Unidad de Investigación Médica e Bioquímica (department for medical research, focal point biochemistry) at the clinic hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team was constructed, consisting of physicians, sick caretakers, nourishment specialists and social workers.
This team becomes supported Salud Pública (INSP) of specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is participate invited to that in the study. Interested parties can come to the sport fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico where every Saturday from 8.00 clock tests with children and youth are carried out.
It emphasized that the investigation began on the sport field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) and is continued for the 8th of October on the sport field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the East of the state México).
If the goal is reached by 500 to 600 investigation people, the study is continued on the sport field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and is locked on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
It explained, let the goal of the study be the becoming acquainted with of the factors and the roll of the genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and youth to the prevention of chronic degenerativer diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of the diabetes declared it, it would be striven for that three thousand children and youth in the age of six to 14 years with the agreement and under supervision of its parents should fill out nourishment related questionnaires.
Also questions about are placed you its physical activity and its informal illness prehistory to control around risk factors, that could have diabetes or kidney insufficiency as a consequence.
It carried out furthermore that at the named Saturdays the investigation people measured (weight, size, waist circumference), its blood pressure controls and determines would become blood value such as the glucose mirror, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt of the identification of gene in the context with obesity at an early age).
Cruz López emphasized, this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the apprehension of the health personnel of person young over the alarming weight increase.
"The health surveys out of the years 1999 and 2006 yielded that in almost six years the share of obese boy had increased around 77 percent and that of the girls with obesity around 47 percent. Also the overweight-ness dramatically had increased", emphasized the specialist of the IMSS.
It indicated, the search for genetic markers would be established because the genetic story of the population of Mexico would differ of of that peoples other.
It indicated that a (e) mexican (in) in the average to 65 percent would be Indianly More american, to 30 percent More european and to 5 percent of African descent, what would be reflected in the genes, that stand with diabetes and excess weight in the context.
Very generally declared it, that genetics of the obesity would express itself in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) taken to us so that this would be warehoused in the form of fat.
The researcher explained, who would exist direct utility for the investigation participants in a comprehensive investigation of the children, with which assessed would become, whether these showed a degree of overweight-ness or obesity.
It would refer even the occurrence of dark skin folds in the nape and at the interior arm (Akanthosis), that to the probability of metabolism interferences and diabetes in the before stage, examines.
All information confidentially would be treated and would be announced the parents in writing by the physicians. The physicians explain all fair results to the parents and strike them changes of the lifestyle before, that are appropriate to the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained, would give it three basic factors, that are responsible for excess weight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: To spend movement deficiency, that is missing movement in the everyday life, most time of the day before the television and to use means of transportation, to go in place of short ways on foot.
The high calorie reception, that is, an increased consumption at gezuckerten drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger etc.) together with a high fat reception and protein reception as well as the genetics, that is supposed to be analyzed in this research project.
