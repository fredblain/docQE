Portugal very confidently
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento sees with optimism the return match against Bosnia (22:00 clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon toward.
In the away game, the objectivity had been missing both teams.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we become a happy team and above all a happy country be".
