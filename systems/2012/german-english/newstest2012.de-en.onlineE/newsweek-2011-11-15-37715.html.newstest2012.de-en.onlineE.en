Military stands the growing pressure for hard reaching through in rape
In this week, an important hearing decides about whether 28 women and men are not accused because of intervention in a rape before the court martial.
If it should not come in addition, hundreds of complainants stand for the next hearing ready.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when it was raped at night by a soldier colleague.
It was returned 2008 and it just to its barracks in Miramar north in October of San Diego of the supper with a friend when it encountered on a masculine colleague, who carried a 12 pack beer with itself.
It asked it whether it would be allowed to accompany it on a Drink into its room.
"My alarm bells went at", said Lyman.
But the Texan wiped its objections aside.
I thought: "Alas what, it is 19.
It is from Texas", said it.
"I wished, I would have heard" on my belly feeling.
Few minutes after they had gone on Lymans room, the man stepped behind it, pressed it downward and raped it, maintains it.
This week, on the 18th of November, Lyman and 27 wait other present and earlier military employees anxiously for a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which decided becomes, whether a complaint, that they raised against the earlier Minister of Defense Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is allowed, before court.
The complaint maintains that Gates and Rumsfeld against the far common rape within the military and under injury the constitutional right of the soldiers did not advance.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer out of Washington, D.C.S submitted, comprised the complaint originally 17 complainants, who increased however in the following months on 28: 25 Women and three men who maintain everyone, that they were raped or sexually abused by soldier colleague, and that the military neglected it to make available to determine, to convict or an appropriate jurisdiction after the supposed attacks.
Burke says, it would pursue the uppermost military leadership because the problem would begin there.
"The military is hierarchical constructed", says it.
"Who are the single people who are in the position to eradicate the culture reward of that to? The leadership".
Burke says moreover that it contacted for February almost 400 further surviving, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of that all complainants put so to speak its eggs into a basket, become it if necessarily, many further complaints submit, around the pressure uprightly to receive.
The team of the defense for the defense ministry, cited of federal district attorney Neil MacBride, placed a proposal in order to reject complaint.
The acts of the court that exist Newsweek itemize in detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused by present or earlier soldier for injuries, to which it came in the military forces.
Based on a law of the Supreme Court from the year 1950, THE so-called Feres doctrine, sticks the government not for injuries, that are added itself in the active service of present soldier.
"The presumed damages emerged during the military service of the complainants", purports the document.
The defense ministry denies every commentary to this story.
The things changed since the '1950's.
If women are not allowed yet always to the service in the battle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams play attach roles increasingly important by soldiers, especially in the contact with domestic women in the war zones.
The result: between these two getting 150 soldiers, two-thirds of them in battle actions died.
It is at the time that the military is modernized, says Burke.
And it does not stand there in its battle alone: three further complaints except hers are pending.
At the Yale Law School prepares the veterans' legal services Clinic a complaint against the four most important military academies because of presumed support of a misogynistic atmosphere.
Hereof independently veteran gathers the public-spirited Vietnam of America a complaint against the military before, in which one concentrates on the diagnosis "personality interference", that rape victims received to release around it out of the service - an usual procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's it Action network, a human right group.
Your group passed in December complaint against the veteran administration (dt. : Administration of the war veteran) on, in that it its practices discriminating in its contact with achievement claims for people reproached, who indicated to have become sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws was produced independently from one another through a mixture out of senators and representatives of both parties the congress, that offer a row of criteria.
2010 became according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt. : Office for prevention and message of sexual abuse) the defense ministry 3,158 sexual abuses indicated.
Yet most abuses are not reported at all and after the own estimation of the Pentagon, this number considers ca. 13.5 percent of the appreciated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report that was published in March examines also the punishment pursuit rates: 2010 came 20 percent of the grasped cases in the military before court, only half so many like in the civil law.
The complainants in Burkes case describe its attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lymans case, it reported the presumed rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
In this night, says it, became it 11 times asked to tell the details of its rape of a whole series of policemen, physicians and commanders.
It had was found a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of its aggressor, that came from a cut at its arm, in its bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, was listened to Lyman of a judge. During this hearing, it was asked about the sex, that it had spread before that with its friend.
Six people stated as character witnesses in the name of the presumed culprit, who was absolved in the end.
"I remind one me yet well of the day, when the judgment misread became", says Lyman.
"I thought would use, the pains. I raced screaming out of the courtoom".
"You brought remember into the psychiatric department and I me that I came out, when I again, to my commander said me: That was not its procedure. That was my procedure".
Lyman was requested to search for a military psychiatrist, who diagnosed in the end a personality interference and it for unfit for duty declared.
It became release in January 2010 dishonorable so that it receives no support at all.
Whether the complaint, that Lyman and the other complainants submitted, makes headway,, is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of the jurisprudence at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, so it notices in: "In my opinion, they should make headway".
What stands between them and a sentence, is this doctrine, that is criticized, since it was questioned for the first time.
I am for life a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military limps a decade afterwards, for they do not possess the same stimuli and the same deterrence that entails a liability.
It adds: "The chances stand against it... however it is important to it, that it it try".
These things will change only then if good people to fight are ready.
If the hearing does not follow its way, becomes Burke, that lawyer of the complainants begin, with its hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We become the military in this regard further fight, until it reforms comes", says it.
Or until we die, what enters also always first.
