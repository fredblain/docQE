"Coldly and inhuman" : Differently Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Differently Behring Breivik, that man, who stood two crazed rampages, with which in this summer in Norway 77 people were killed, described itself in its first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" of fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway", said he before a courtoom with more than 500 people.
"I raise objection against the court because you received your mandate of organizations, that hate ideologies support and because through it the Multikulturalismus becomes" supported.
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not admit guilt".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he did not want to give "Breivik the possibility to use this hearing as a platform, on that he its views to the expression bring can".
For the same reason, it denied Breivik that a beforehand composed speech brought along, the permission to turn to the end of the hearing at the members of its victims.
Nesheim arranged moreover that the police Breivik retains for 12 further weeks in detention, it four weeks no access to the media has. It said that the authorities exactly will control all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 surviving and member of the victims took at the hearing part.
Some came look in the hope, Breivik into the eye to can, others wanted the confirmation that it remains behind lock and bar.
Everyone took part with the goal that all runs out on a locking up.
"I thought, it causes coldly and inhuman", told a surviving of Utoya the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me, it goes on a piece after I seen the suspect and have" belonged.
Breivik carried a dark suit and a blue necktie and caused during the entire hearing quietly and professionally. He viewed journalists and surviving into the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Reference bizarre in spite of Breiviks, he part of a larger "resistance" movement would be, came the judge to the end that he would not be and said insane, that there would be no proof, that he would have had accomplices.
It does not like to unite please that the attacks of the 22nd of July was apparent the work of a single extremist and that of a group more radical.
Does that but ease automatically the grief and the confusion that an entire nation yet always senses?
"I wished, it would look like a monster, but that does it not", said the member of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if it did" it.
