The threat is tangible
After the disclosure of the "Zwickauer cell", Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.
A newspaper speaks quite about one "bloody ideology" that would revive now again.
The murders at eight Turkish sturdy and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
On this message is reacted in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with anxiety and worry.
For for many Germans Turks, an a long time dead believed ghost returns therewith: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in solo gene in May 1993 there were no comparable force with right-wing extremist background more against Turks.
That there is hostility towards foreigners in Germany, never stood nevertheless in question.
The uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals however sizes whose dimension is yet by far foreseeable.
Does the bloody ideology "live again on"? titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand emphasizes that one of the culprits is supposed to have been a V man of the constitution protection, and appears provides that also German authorities could be involved into the radical right-wing swamp.
Prudently community Germany reacted the Turkish: It reminded one of the weekend with a warn watch before the Brandenburg Gate at the victims of racist force.
First two weeks before community in Berlin had thought the Turkish jointly with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In cheerful colors, living and working together had been produced - as a story of the success.
How a slap the reporting of some Turkish media causes there: The heading of an article in the Turkish Internet platform reads "Germany gift to the fiftieth" "Haber X" that the backgrounds of the murder series reports.
Also the Germany edition of the "Hürriyet" does not let itself take it to pull this intellectual connection.
"It catches on to stink", is named the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes therein that people had been murdered, who would have paid taxes and would have performed with its work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Extremely critically the action of the police and its late search success is discussed in German Turkish Internet forums.
Why it had not occurred already much sooner to the German authorities, to search in right-wing extremist circles for suspects, the authors are surprised.
Many one appears at least rhetorical to drastic means ready: "Here further is been sloppy, remains the migrant nothing other remaining as the self-defense and the armament".
Probably the best self-protection will be" "that.
"Of the goodness of the clarification and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network hangs very strongly the internal peace in Germany from", writes "selenium".
The attacks of Mölln and solo gene in the nineties clarified what means if the internal peace in Germany in danger is.
The photo of the fire ruins of solo gene deeply is anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turk living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and can flow the Germans, that mistrust and distance in right force.
The attacks sharpened however the we feeling on Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of the German politics was criticized at that time above all after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused, who to visit surviving of Mölln.
After the fire attack of solo gene, it sent a condolence telegram at the Turkish president of the state, let itself represent Klaus Kinkel on the funeral service in Cologne however of its Foreign Minister - Kinkel counted at that time in its speech up how many duties the local Turks performed.
Very so, as the value of a person calculates itself after the height of its tax duty.
The present reporting of the Turkish media shows again once how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is into the local rule of law since then.
Next to the efforts of an extensive clarification and reappraisal of the radical right-wing terrorism in Germany, it needs this times open words.
