Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalizeed, such an expert group
The Canadians live in denial of death how out of a report of the royal company of Canada follows
The group explained that governments to place collaborated, institutions of the hygiene and physicians with respect to analgesic treatment around the best analgesic means ready, and this also over the cancer cases going out.
The Canadian company lives in a denial bearing vis-à-vis death.
Only 9% of the Canadians admit die would want and meet actually on that to speak with its physician over conditions, under which it dispositions to this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report the royal company of Canada at which six experts were involved, who are connected on different areas of expertise, among other things ethics, right and medicine, together.
This group recommends the government to alter the criminal law so, in order to permit accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice stands, and to make to be sure with patients, who are looked at as in a position, such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts quote a survey published recently of the independent company EIU that had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the globe together.
Although Canada placed itself herewith on the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical dead care in Canada produced a culture, in which the people have anxiety to cut" the subject of death.
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to analgesic means, report ordered that of the royal company of Canada experts to us.
And in spite of the majority wish of the Canadians to die at home, die however in the end 68.6% of this in the hospital.
Of the entire country here observed the rate with 86% is at deaths entered in the hospital in the Quebec most highly.
In the delicate question regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report to conclusions come, that of the position of the federal government which already has to want no changes at all of the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide of distinguished, arranged contrary to are.
Now however there is loudly the expert who inspected all those countries, whose extension legalizes euthanasia and accompanied suicide or have entkriminalisiert, no proof at all that such an Entkriminalisierung would not stretch into its application, therefore the practice execution of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of unkompetenten or consenting people after.
To the contrary meet substantially more cases of such infraction just in the countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalizeed, how yesterday Jocelyn Downie, cosigner of the report confirmed, in a videophone conference.
"Euthanasia becomes in Canada where it is unambiguously illegal, practice".
"Also accompanied suicide becomes in Canada practice, although here unambiguously illegally", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate the euthanasia
Let's imagine that loudly one in 2010 carried out Angus-Reid-surveys of already 85% the Canadians for the benefit of the euthanasia had itself, because they are of the opinion, this would allow us it people at the end of its journey through life to soften its sorrows.
And 66% believe that the circumstance of a legalization of the euthanasia would not have as a consequence to mediate the message that life of older or hindered people less value.
With respect to the people, who have already an accompanied suicide practice, the questioned represent the opinion to 41% that these should be pursued not criminal.
What concerns maintenance or attitude of the means with patients, represents itself situation as fewer clearly, so the authors of the report.
Just as these in its recommendation index suggest that in the criminal law indicated become should, that the dropping of the means, for which a legal rejection had produced, should not count, as criminal.
The expert group demands in addition that specialists of public health should be educated in the task of respecting a dropping of the means at the end of life, and this without criminal pursuit fear to must.
The group explained that governments, institutions of the hygiene and physicians collaborated with respect to analgesic treatment in order to place the best analgesic means ready, and this also over the cancer cases going out.
Finally the group with respect to the means long-range used already in the Canadian institutions to the hygiene to pain relief or this demands to pull at least in deliberation because these served just as few like the euthanasia in addition to reduce physical pains and this on the same procedures would relate themselves.
Reserve other experts
Some experts on the right zone of public health proposed already reservations with respect to the conclusions of the expert report of the royal company of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health right, has the bearing of the report lower drawing experts among other things as" extremely" designated, suffer would set because these the euthanasia practice in in the final stages no boundaries at all.
"This opens the gates for a situation, in that each, that suicidal and older than a 18 years is, another person to ask, it in its suicide helpful to be", so RA Deschamps that yesterday a summary of the report had looked through.
RA Deschamps emphasizes also, the authors of the report seemed to place the individual responsibility of the single over all other values, that are involved in the social Gewirke of the company.
Now however, says it, would give it" guidelines and obligations in a company".
Margaret Somerville, specialist for health right, expressed also" a strong resistance" vis-à-vis the conclusions of the report, that called it as" per-euthanasia-manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, that is even member of the royal company of Canada, does not dispute especially the report statement regarding the model of abuses in certain countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalizeed, like for example in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
