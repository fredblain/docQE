V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race diagonally through America
Review
The originally carefree trip becomes avoidable, amateurish mistake through a series totally the routine trip to the early layer.
It succeeded to be sure to fulfill the ambitions to a large degree, but what that utilizes already if obviously no one was in the mood to do a little more.
Already before it came on the counters, the new part woke expectations high with the subtitle "The Run".
It promised yet to shift the already aged game series "Need for Speed" again a piece into a new dimension and in the game cash demonstration examples, it seemed to be actually not only an of many Action race game.
We were also curious how the fit passages fall out, in which the head protagonist climbs out of the car and goes on on foot.
But how one it in NFS already accustomed is, is in the end effect of much differently when one had expected.
Certain - quite respectable arcades races are potential it, but altogether the game is lessened of some superfluous mistakes, are present that in this series more or less already a couple for year.
Therefore are it actual no more mistake, but rather sooner sign of an in principle inconceivable laziness the game developer.
The adventure begins very good.
First of all one is introduced into the story, whose principle figure has Jack certain problems of personal character; the single solution seems to be, to participate in an illegal race diagonally through America.
In San Francisco, therefore at the west coast, sits down one at the steering wheel - with the task of being firster in New York.
The reason idea includes an entire row of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided in ten stages and in more than fifty single races.
That means that each race is expedited on other stretch and that the single stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
One has would offer no moment the impression, that game again and again the same.
Many environments yet are expressed in addition to look at lovely although the technical level of the graphics does not go out over that of the earlier parts of the series.
Therefore nothing Weltbewegendes.
But the trip through the desert, through autumnal landscape or highly above through deeply snow-covered landscape cause visually very comfortably.
There and again atypical elements bring a little change into the single races.
In the desert for example one is surprised of a desert storm, that strongly restricts the visibility.
In the mountains again one must pay attention infernal that one is not spilled by an avalanche.
Incidentally quite well sequentially the single races are incorporated.
Pass to be sure only a couple, but it.
One tries a while so to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), has one time to make up (classic race against the stop clock), expects one another personal duel with a single contractor.
And in addition also yet the police interferes, that wants to ruin one the entire thing.
Passages in which Jack leaves the vehicle are a novelty.
At the same time it concerns sooner certain interactive animations, in which Jack escapes before any someone and must help where it the players, in that he presses the correct button in the correct moment.
Therefore nothing complicated.
It surprised to be sure that it gives much in the game fewer such passage, than one expect would become (concrete probably only three).
In the end this is the thing sooner to the advantage, for so this element has at least no chance to become boringly - it belongs in the context to that above said to the elements, that more varied make the game.
The load model steps in the Fußtapfen of the previous parts.
That is, of current view point seen, tears it to be sure no trees from, on the other hand could one do not maintain, it would be bad.
He who seeks realistic simulation, must look around itself elsewhere.
The local load model becomes but an action loaded race load also further very well just although one could find better in the competition.
Until there, all in best order is so far.
Real problems emerge first after certain time.
In contrast to the load model, the collision model O. K is not entire.
Of a game of this type is to be expected hardly that it calculates complicated deformation and collision, but if one has practically before no impact on any an object premonition, how the car behaves, is obviously not all in order.
Typical example: In the narrow outdated or driving past "roves" accommodating car one at many places the other vehicle only easily, in other, almost identical situations comes one however into the hurling and turns wild pirouette.
Or goes the carts immediately to scrap.
Thanks to the remainder type system, that continues to be sure nothing from, from annoying is it always.
The remainder type are solved so: if one has total damage or lands far to one side of the stretch, throws one the game back at the last criterion of the stretch.
Only - in every race one has only five remainder types.
If one emptied it, all goes at the beginning loosely..
The remainder type are not therefore sooner something akin to a remedy, for the case that somewhat does not succeed, but thereon left should itself one rather.
Sometimes helps helps however not even the remainder type, there nothing other when the critical section out of the head to learn.
Expressed unpleasant is that the same things happen often at the same places.
One must pass through many curves for example on entirely specific type and manner, fits otherwise one simply not through.
Elsewhere one meets at the corresponding place of "civil" car always in same configuration, equal whether one comes firster or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
That is especially in situations annoying if one sees, that the contractor passes by before one playing at two accommodating car, but until one arrives even there, the vehicles are already in such a position that one must bypass or brake it.
And it is equal when one arrives there, everything is conceived namely so that it comes to this situation always thickly before your nose.
The contractors have even further advantages.
In the entire game, there is a couple of places where one is overtaken always at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without consideration on the moment.
At the displaced, this is to the conclusion of the game on the long bridge, that one happens in against direction.
The contractor must come overtake one here obviously on devil out.
And if it is then already once before one, it takes one naturally the visibility so that one goes there at the beginning the own car a couple of time in Klump.
Clearly - the game wants to make is one simply more exciting and more exciting however this intention so clear that it one quickly the joy in the game vermiest.
And that is a shame, for in spite of simpler load model, the game is altogether quite entertaining and in places also so aktionsgeladen that one knows almost no longer, where one the head stands.
And in principle is is equal, what "guilt" on that - the draft with fifty unique routes, that arrangement of the races in a manner that no boredom can arise, or somewhat entirely other...
An unusual idea is also the vehicle change in the course of the races.
One may not survey at the same time the gas station at the stretch, for just here one can change the car although in most cases the car suffices, that one just has.
The cars are subdivided in three categories.
The sports cars are suited well for the municipal areas, the strong American saloon cars for the straight freeways and exotic super sports cars for the technical trips, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game story goes also the tasks mode (challenges) - therefore the races in the single localities that one knows out of the story.
Here there are not only medals, but rather to win also experience points for the own profile, that is joint for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
In order to arrive at the higher driver level, different objects must be opened begun: by the car, up to the Backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected simultaneously with the Online function Autolog, that among other things the own obtained results with which other player compares and provides also for further collective functions.
A situation in the last race of the story is one of further incomprehensible blunders.
Here one comes namely with the car into an U-train-tunnel (on my account) where one long races (on my account) in the dark on the rails.
On the Tacho, figures between 150 a look comes 200 km/h (on my account), but there all at once of behind a SUBWAY and goes one uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorship, we will fight probably yet long about whether that was a Blackout of the game fashioners or whether the authors consider us to be so stupid.
The technical side is is nothing overwhelming however at least the visual overall impression in most cases quite impressively and here and there even brilliant.
More all the more annoyinger is that in some exciting moments the picture repetition frequency becomes itself slower and this sometimes rather dramatic.
That concerns however nominally the accidents with larger number of involving where one a continuous FPS utilizes anyway nothing.
The tone reproduction is so far O. K. and the Soundtrack is taste thing.
Address in the exertion to a scale possible as wide as only of rather young audience, emerged a Soundtrack a lá "by everyone something" - however who buys itself such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are mixed sooner.
If the game would not be lessened by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have been able to maintain with the breast tone of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in the last years.
But so the game causes somehow unfinished.
At for itself a class pleasure, but one should be prepared on that that one these mistakes with the Power of airport floodlight prick into the eyes.
