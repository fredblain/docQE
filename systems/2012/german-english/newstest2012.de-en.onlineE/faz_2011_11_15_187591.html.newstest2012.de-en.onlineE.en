The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The adventurousest bank of Europe does not sit in Italy or France, but rather in Switzerland.
The UBS went in the finance crisis almost bankrupt and slides since then of a crisis in the next.
Now it should arrange a German.
So it not certainly had thought itself Axel weaver.
After its spectacular departure of the tip of the German Federal Bank was acquaintance become in July that it would begin 2013 a nearly just as spectacular new job: Supervisory board president of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel weaver was happy publicly, praised Switzerland whether its beauty and the UBS whether its newly won solidity and let fall friendly comments over the future colleagues.
"The UBS created" the Turnaround.
"I please me on the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
Yet already in September became clear that all would come very differently.
A dealer of the UBS in London had gone around all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billions of Euro verzockt.
UBS chief executive Oswald Grübel, a not only in Switzerland of praised bank, had to go.
The supervisory board president of the UBS counts since then also as struck - and ask everyone: When does Axel weaver come finally?
Already became well known that weaver may advise the bank of February 2012 at.
It receives and the supervisory board chair already in May - not first in 2013 how the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel weaver, that becomes hard.
It is no bank, rather economy professor and central banker and certainly compel would have had a training period.
With a blow, it accepts then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, that proved just now once again, that it earns a long time the title scandal bank of Europe" "largest.
For the UBS is on the one hand tremendously - until recently was it the largest asset manager of the world - and has slid on the other hand for years of a scandal in the next.
Nothing, seems it, remains the once so proud Swiss bank saved.
It began in the finance crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent call.
The image of the concealed and solid, but also ausgebufften of Swiss asset manager it had combined with ambitious goals: It wanted to become an entirely large number also in the Investmentbanking.
So the UBS 2007 administered on the one hand more money of being able to do customers with 1.6 trillion dollar than each other bank of the world.
And on the other hand it was advanced as an investment bank into the league of the largest banks of the world.
That made impression.
The bank former and later long-time bank professors in Zurich Hans violinist tells: I placed" "my student the UBS at that time always as a pattern of a good bank.
"From current point of view one asks himself: How was I able to be mistaken only so"?
It was mistaken powerfully.
In 2007 became for the first time obvious that somewhat proper in the UBS sloping ran.
Middle of the year resigned chief executive Peter Wuffli surprisingly, that counted until there as more highly more intellectual and just as brilliant bank.
A few months later one suspected why it had gone.
The Investmentsparte of the bank had itself with verzockt Subprime paper and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder that, the UBS announced an increase in capital in height of would say and would write 13 billions of franc.
For that it found still would have actually investors, to be sure which, over that of many an until shortly before the nose gerümpft: an opaque Asian country fund from Singapore and an Arabic country fund that was concealed so, that one did not learn once its name.
Yet that was only the first blow.
It came in April 2008 more badly.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, supervisory board president Marcel Ospel, 2006 yet of that at the second-best paid supervisory board of Switzerland, stepped back.
The catastrophe followed in October 2008: The UBS stood in view of its misinvestment in the finance crisis before the breakdown and had to be rescued by the country.
The national bank bought the UBS for hesitated billions of problematic securities, the Swiss confederacy gave become could six billions of franc for a compulsion change loan, over that it co-owner of the bank.
The entire Switzerland was shaken - then it noted how dramatic it is for a small country, if it harbors so large banks.
In the end the balance sum of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphics).
"Once again could we the UBS do not rescue", says bank researcher violinist.
At the first catastrophe, the second joined.
Already few months on that capitulated the UBS in the tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of being able to do customers, that had defrauded if possible taxes by means of the bank.
Moreover it agreed a payment of 780 million dollars to - as a repayment of unjustified profits out of these businesses including punishment impact.
Therewith well known the UBS more or less openly to have helped in the tax evasion.
Simultaneously it lost been was something, that for time immemorial its capital in the competition around rich customers: the Nimbus of the discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss was bank secret no longer that.
The resignation of chief executive and supervisory board president followed it.
And the Exodus of customer moneys.
So the bank had lost its credibility in both central company divisions within less months: in the Investmentbanking through the false speculations and in the fortune administration through the aid to the tax evasion.
And straight as it again somewhat quieter became, thought just than one, would manage now the UBS it already again, follows there this unfortunate dealer story: A single dealer verzockt 1.7 billions of Euro before the bank notices, that somewhat sloping runs.
And it becomes obvious: With the risk management in the Investmentbanking, it does not work out obviously still.
"With the case Adoboli has one assess must, that itself the risk inspection too little changed has", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the bank institute of the University of Zurich.
Also the head of finance of a large German bank is certain: "The problem of the UBS is that they has not" the risk inspection in the handle.
At the same time it had been yet exact the idea of the caution, with which the Swiss was begun bankers long time ago, to become hats of the large fortunes of the world: no all too large risks, for that security for the money - the world liked to collapse also on the far side of the Alps republic once.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become landed the symbol for imperturbable reliability how and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich fits yet to the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Züricher railway station street, that leads of the central station out of directly to Lake Zurich, that will frame of the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the store rents belong to the highest in Europe.
One finds jeweler such as Tiffany's it here between Swiss tradition businesses such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss has resided here banks: of the national bank over the palace of the Credit Suisse up to elitist private banks such as Julius bear.
One enters the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble disguised, stand before that thick leather armchairs, next to the bank Logo a large reference sign to the "safe".
The UBS knows, what the customer seeks here: Security.
Both Swiss displaced this idea of the Swiss bank large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however sometime - or betray how the boss of a small Swiss finds private bank.
It would not like to read its name rather in the newspaper, makes in the end it, like all Swiss bankers, also with both large banks of businesses.
The UBS had become much too large, finds it - above all in the Investmentbanking where moreover the hinge Saxons would have spread out.
The Swiss would have there nothing more to say.
"And if yet, they adapted" itself a long time to the customs of the hinge Saxons.
Actually it was gave the Anglo-Saxon Investmentbanking that changed the UBS, its profits first high and then the debacle: No European financial institution lost so much money in the Subprime jungle like the Swiss large bank.
On the 15th of October 2008, the catastrophe became visible.
"At that Wednesday concluded the government coalition of the small seven million country the largest rescue operation in the story of its nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in its book of "the UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billions of Euro of allowed the politicians in order to rescue the large bank standing before the bankruptcy.
How was it able to come in addition?
If one speaks with Swiss banks, they see the problem above all in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 merged themselves two of the three Swiss large banks to a powerful group.
A bank emerged was, that already in the fusion to largely for the small Switzerland - and always further grew.
At the same time helped that both different precursors banks of the UBS supplemented itself: one pass, but sleepy bank with the focal point fortune administration in Zurich and a poorer, but already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalized investment banks came favorably at much money, with which they were able to turn a gigantic wheel.
Two names are connected with this ascent of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 group bosses of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, at that time chairperson of the supervisory board.
"I thought always, Wuffli and Ospel would be a dream team", says bank researcher Hans violinist.
"Wuffli, the Hochintellektuelle, modest, that much of models and statistics understands worked up here has" itself, and Ospel, the belly person, that of the bank scholar until very above.
But Ospel had depended to the end on Wuffli.
And Wuffli had made a decisive mistake at the end probably: "It thought, its models would be the reality", says violinist.
"That is a tragic case".
Tragically, perhaps.
Is clear: Insolence came before the case.
Colleagues of the UBS remember clearly the management Meetings, on which group boss Wuffli issued again and again the same slogan: Knock Goldman special it of the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the earth.
It cited the "League Tables", that results tables, that documented the success of the banks of that time.
There the UBS wanted, after very above.
Some steps already had succeeded its.
In the foreign currency business and in the share trade, it played very above.
Management consultants who were delegated emphasized however a weakness: In the international interest business, in the bank language "Fixed Income", would give it a powerful distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has spaces in American mortgage products.
In order to close this space, UBS proceeded into an adventure, that cost it almost the existence.
Hungrily after growth, invested both the bank itself and a before its established Hedgefonds into American Subprime plants.
It developed to a powerful machine, the securities on American mortgage credit packed and passed along - at the same time however also even risks retained.
When other banks sought a long time the exit.
"Yet in the summer 2007, when the American real-estate market in flames stood, has the UBS there bought", says bank expert violinist.
So largely the euphoria, so deeply the case.
A manager after the other had to go when the attempts fell out to clean up more hard than thought.
Posts in the UBS became the sling seat and are shaky until today.
He who leads the large bank now, has a nearly impossible job.
It must find a strategy for a bank, that all nearby business models are missing come.
Bank researcher violinist has already an idea: End with the Investmentbanking, concentration on the fortune administration, return to the Swiss roots.
Very so far the bank does not want to go to be sure (yet).
But the Investmentbanking strongly should shrink, so much is now already clear.
At the coming Thursday, the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to introduce its future strategy.
Italo Swiss old the 51 years was thought actually only as a temporary solution when the bank separated itself surprisingly by predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile he prevailed: It should lead durably the businesses of the UBS, divided the Züricher bank on Tuesday with.
Ermotti wants to cut back the investment bank on the state middle of the nineties.
It paints 3500 places.
That not however will pass.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
With what does it want to earn money?
Those are certain now already asks themselves the questions, that Axel weaver.
Publicly he says would seek himself until now only, he with his wife first once a dwelling in Zurich.
Next year.
