21 house in Vienna
The moved pavilion
Of Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture story with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Fair pavilion of Brussels 1958 obtained prices, became in Vienna the museum, stood empty and degenerated.
Now it will reopen as a display house.
If by more in more a more modern more manner post-war architecture is enthused, of clear forms, glass halls, courageous would swing and believe in are new building materials, that typical for that the technical progress, is the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl of tails for the Brüssler World Fair 1958 an appropriate and famous example.
Schwanzers pavilion got at that time the Grand Prix d' architecture for its easily and floating causing steel-glass-construction.
The building counts until today as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
It made the architect so well known that that constructed pavilion also in the next World Fair of Austria.
With its legendary BMW four cylinder house plus bowl-like next to building in Munich, it became 1973 in the end internationally famous.
Its as pavilion planned temporarily display building one had set up garden to the World Fair in the Swiss in the Viennese south railway station, had rebuilt and opens 1962 therein a museum of the 20th century - the "20 house" was named it.
Suited was the building however neither spatial and technical as museum - no walls to the hanging the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building has stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect rebuilt Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion, is named he now "21 house" and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening opens the museum Belvedere to which the house belongs, there the first display - a windfall in every regard.
Put through has Agnes Husslein Arco, that became 2007 new director the Austrian gallery Belvedere, the new beginning.
Husslein Arco, graduated art historian with notable career among other things in the youth as an Eiskunstläufererin, later in Sotheby's it, that Guggenheim museum and as a foundation director of the museum the Salzburg modern, put through the reconstruction emphatically with politicians and Denkmalschützern, it procured public means and private sponsor moneys and determined the utilization.
Except present art should be issued the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba by the of the same name foundation, should be a café and a bookshop there, and an office house had to be constructed in addition.
Severe supervision, small budget
For the execution, Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.
Not only, because he rebuilt Joseph Olbrichs sec meal ion in Vienna sensitive, and expands and won had the competition, but rather because he studied in tails at the technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for it an "enormously important place", at which he had looked at "almost each weekend" the displays.
It knew the original design, and it knew the problems of the building that lost already in its transfer to Vienna and its repurposing at generosity and lightness.
In the present reconstruction, there were far larger problems: The building was "an energy sling", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were exchanged, were used optical fiber reinforced insulating glass and replaces the glass roof by special security glass.
Cold bridges steel girders were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled covers were rehabilitated.
Two first floors brought place for the new utilization, a layered light ditch between house and street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the easy tail pavilion.
The originals outside doors remained, that painted is house in the old reddish brown rustproofing shade.
And the movie theater hall is even yet very exactly so how it was earlier.
And that of all under severe supervision of the monument authority and with small budget.
"Often must a material found become, that well is and approve is and also the historical preservation office pleased", Krischanitz says and shows on a ruppigen ground in the first floor there.
In spite of all compulsions, problem and rebuilt is the building flexible and easy remained.
It would be difficult been with the pavilion, "that from Brussels came therefore", said Krischanitz recently, a typical „Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte".
So an architecture stands "always at the incorrect place" and wanted awake" nevertheless "a correct consciousness.
In this case, the 21 is not house however at the incorrect place, for a city structural windfall entered: Around the Swiss garden around just the "central station quarters" newly planned totally emerge, with office and dwellings.
And another windfall yet will enter perhaps: The 21 house could get strengthening of one other Krischanitz building, for the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought hears the Berliners temporarily art hall, and how one, negotiated it already with the city around a neighborly location in the Swiss garden.
