7 Lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve jobs that this week in a theater was shown
After death of Steve jobs on the 5th of October some compared it to Henry Ford and lifted at the same time the technology genius as a large modern inventor forth.
What Apple fans find however perhaps informativest in the most young again discovered job interview, which became in this week before special film demonstrations on the important markets entstaubt, is how very this creative head understood business processes and work flows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even appointed hip pi, but he was did handicrafts also a meticulous organizer, that enthusiastically at charts - a man who believed, that many managers suffer from "an illness of the thinking", "that a really magnificent idea 90 percent of the work settles... [however] There is an enormous quantity at craftsmanship between a magnificent idea and a magnificent product".
1995 developed quaked Cringely the series of TV "triumph the specialists with no other interests" over the departure the personnel computer. And it sat more long than an hour with jobs together, in which they led one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At this time had passed as a 10 years since jobs had been pressed out of Apple. And he worked looked already hard at its new computer business NeXT, and forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part was used by Cringleys interview in specialists with no other interests, he says that the copy model of the interview were absent from the delivery.
First after jobs death one discovered a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director.
This easily revised film material forms the base for the 68minütigen film "Steve jobs: The lost interview", that this Wednesday and Thursday comes into the country marks theaters.
For someone, who is for that well known that it detests detailed interview, appears jobs here surprisingly enthusiastically in the explanation of its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly reflectively.
In the course of the interview, it comes four times to longer recesses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds pondering in which jobs weighs unambiguously its thoughts and is striven around accuracy.
There is also moments, in which jobs comes' Perfektionismus too days, if it reacts apparently impatiently to Cringelys questions and to go in it anschubst, more quickly on subjects or subplots of larger importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone received appears the lost interview somehow uncannily farsighted if job values, what other businesses its opinion make correctly or incorrectly and its own vision to the future the computer represents.
It is a thing to read posthumous assessments of the career jobs'. To see but jobs here as the desirous dreamer, who is on the leap to the grandeur, is somewhat very differently, originally and inspiring.
It has a vision how the things could be and be should.
Shortly after it had carried out this here everything, it pulled loose and made it.
A fast view of seven remarkable sequence of the lost interviews:
How it learned to lead a business:
"During the entire years in the business I ask always: "Why do you do things"?. And the answer that you always get is: "Oh, so it simply is made".
No one knows why it does, what it does. No one in the business thinks really detailed about things.
I assessed that.
Jobs continues its efforts from to streamline the accounting in Apple.
Astonish, recorded became developed like costs - usually began one with "standard costs", that on bare supposition there numbers became and that then with "deviation" adapted became - it an automated factory that guaranteed, that the business costs could be determined into the smallest.
How the pope ridiculed became:
Jobs tells of that "Blue box", that it constructed with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one was able to sneak in into the telephone company and long distance calls was able to lead for nothing.
Over the device, much was written already, but jobs enthusiasm when it describes the Blue box as an act of the Selbstbemächtigung, is contagious.
It describes how Wozniak and it would test the box, in that they use a chargeable telephone, a call of active and then of an AT&T-network in another combine while they possible grind through so many satellites such as.
"We sent things a half dozen once around the globe and if one into the telephone grölte, came it a minute later in the telephone next door again out", tells jobs giggling.
"We were young and we learned that we ourselves can construct something, the trillion of dollar at infrastructure in the entire world control can".
We both, we much did not know, but we were able to construct this small thing, was believe that can control a gigantic thing, that an incredible lesson and I not that it would give without it Apple.
Jobs passes on of a glorious stroke, that Wozniak and it nearly had drawn-off, when they called middle in the night via Blue box in the Vatican and wanted to speak with the pope, during it so well it Henry Kissinger could imitated.
Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned middle in the night, in order to speak with the American diplomat, must loose laugh both before the pope himself came at the telephone.
How it into the technology fell in love (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called) :
At the age of 12 years, when it searched for spare parts, in order to construct a frequency meter, it searched Hewlett in the directory for Bill and called it on.
Shortly after its 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer a part-time job in Hewlett pack Ard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the single business, that I had seen in the age, and it formed my views about that, what a business was and like good it its colleagues treated".
Later became jobs of one of the HP colleague, that visited the research laboratories of the business in Palo Alto, where he saw produced became" "the first desktop computer, that ever.
It was as large as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown scissors tube and I enamored me into it.
I would climb in HP as a teenager towards the top and would hang on this machine and write programs for it.
How one innovations improves:
Repeatedly in the interview speaks jobs about how one invents spontaneously new products.
Already early in its career when it incorporated some platinums, was asked it of a customer to assemble the entire computer.
It worked with a period allowed for payment of only 30 days and must both think out the assembly and the extradition of the finished devices.
Later in Apple, he remembers the problems, that he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remind one me of decisive arguments... You schrien on that it would last five years [around a mouse to construct, that $ 300 cost would become] and I stood me, went out and found a manufacturer".
We later had ninety days a mouse that we were able to construct let for $ 15. That was incredibly trustworthy.
Over large businesses, that diminish:
Long before it let Apple revival, predicted jobs the ways, on which so many industry giants with its visions in stumbling ridden and the control lost of its shares,.
Say we "work, you in IBM or Xerox, therefore you make a better copier or printer, well and"?
They possess the share monopoly, therefore the business is no longer successful.
Verkäufe and marketing make lead it more successfully, therefore [are it such people], that in the end the businesses and the product with which the people are pressed out of the decision-making.
The product genius, who led to this monopoly position, will have no draft of the people, that regarding good products vs. bad products, eradicated - craftsmanship necessarily.
That happened in Xerox...
Xerox would have been able to possess the entire computer industry.
One more largely would have been able to be ten times, would have can the Microsoft of the '1990's its...
They caught the defeat of the victory.
Over innovation as an art form:
"It lies a lot of craftsmanship between a magnificent idea and a magnificent product... if one this magnificent idea develops, changes it and are awake".
One learns much over its subtleties.
One must undertake votings, determined things, that one cannot, but electrons, glass, robot, factories.
One must notice himself 5000 things, join these drafts, and it everyone...
In the end it runs out runs on the taste, it on that out that one tries, with the best thing, that people created, apart sits down and tries then to join these things to that, what one makes.
Picasso said that good artists copy, magnificent artists swipe.
We are always shameless in the stealing of magnificent ideas.
Part its, what magnificently made Macintosh, was that the people who work there, musician, poet, artist, zoologists, historian were, who are accidental the best computer scientists of the world.
If it had not been the computer industry, they would create in other areas fantastic things.
