If wound have eyes: How researchers observe you on Facebook
Before it became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Behring Breivik was differently only an of many boys, who sent its Anti immigration opinion Online.
On Monday Breivik that stood had to have committed in a crazed rampage in Norway in July, with which 77 people were killed, its first public hearing before court.
Although Breivik alone may have acted, it is by far not alone in the cyberspace: It spent much time to its attack before its computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalist, that radical right-wing groups support on sides of social network.
After the tragedy of this in the summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
Yet how does one find it?
That is easily - one must log on only with Facebook.
"We assessed, that it was not heavy, to them to come", says Jamie Bartlett, the head author of a most young appeared report of the British idea factory DEMOES over the digital populism in Europe.
Data personal Facebook ambush is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett that the researchers must use simply the advertise tool of the side to determine around its desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - so like it marketer for years have done.
Bartletts team found a half million fans of radical right-wing groups throughout Europe and adjusted it then with Adds on, but instead of linking itself with a new volume or a new diet product, invited the Adds users to a survey, in which after its development state, its bearing vis-Ã -vis force and the estimation of its own future asked became.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and its colleagues in a position, more were to be questioned than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without that they must would have left also only once its office.
"It is a quite new research method", says Bartlett.
Some of the results surprise hardly. Online promoters of radical right-wing groups are usually young, man-like and be angry about the immigration.
But in a type of surprising twisting, "that, that more sensibly combine its Online activism with an Offline activism, are, more democratic and less violent as that, that remain" sit behind its computer screens.
Only an example is DEMOES work how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and politics scientist use the side in order to study all, of health questions up to company trend such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
Users active with more than 800 millions, who add in the average three of contents per day, "data generates Facebook supernova" a Forschungsboom that the amount of the scientific works with the name of this side in the title in the last five years let climb around almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beautiful of Facebook is the fact that one can study through this side people, whom one does not reach normally with its Clipboard on the street.
"If you earlier tried to question people of the British national party, to identify" was it very heavy, it.
"You must first the party inform and that would have them never access grants", says Bartlett.
"With Facebook, that of all falls away - you go directly to them".
Others say that the side offers a possibility to recognize and to solve social health problems.
A current study of Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and its colleagues found out that students, who discussed its full intoxication on Facebook, tend, significantly more strongly to the Problemtrinken than students, who were quiet over this subject.
Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example accustomed adviser, who supervise side and help a student, posts if this too many status updates.
"You can a problem do not solve, if you it not recognized have", said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko author and leader of the Child Health, Behavior and Development by the Children's it Research institutes in Seattle of the washington Post.
"We did not find differently found become were" a possibility to identify endangerd children, that.
Facebook taps moreover permanently the data of its own population.
The data team of the side has statistics over the relation status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout at the between choices 2010 and one nationally good fortune index generated (where primarily statements uses became, on that only Facebook access has - master of the digital freedom know for some time, that the side its large data treasure trove for other research purposes accessibly make should).
Yet the users of Facebook do not know that the side observes it, whether they want that now or. Around with a friend, who is removed thousands of miles to be able to play Scrabble, permitted one the side the own personal data pass from.
But what do if the users of Facebook part of a survey become, of which they not know yet once something?
While researchers have guidelines exertally determined, how they gather its data Offline, is permitted Online everything.
"I believe not, that many users generally over the fact thought have, that a researcher its profiles study could", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in the London Knowledge lived, to a study from the year 2006, in which he examined the public sides of students on Facebook.
"What concerns it, concerned it only it and its friends".
Then there is yet the question of the methodics.
Even Offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is to be known impossible how many of the statements in a user profile and in contributions are true.
"What one on Facebook says and what one outside of of Facebook makes, are two totally different things", says Selwyn.
Therefore Selwyn thinks in spite of its years as a technology researcher that a Clipboard and a pencil are yet always the best research tools, that everyone can use.
"It gives no replacement for that, into the real world to go out and with real person to speak", says he.
"Social research must attend to the social - and a lot of social life finds yet always Offline instead of".
