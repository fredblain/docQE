Fire story:
The innovator IBM steps into the second century of its existence
If one wanted to search for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most exactly, this would be well the word "longevity".
For the wide public, IBM is that synonymous for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern business although since its foundation already a century is slipped away.
The base to this longevity its first boss put already - that Thomas J visionary. Watson sen.
Already it represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems let easily solve themselves if the people were ready to think a little.
Its slogan "Think!" became so the trademark, around which life of the future giant should happen, (and simultaneously to the title of the proprietary periodical, that one in IBM already in 1935 to publish began).
This was also the base of the business culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us out of IBM this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement toward the future.
IBM survived and was also therefore an entire century successfully because it faithfully remained to its principles and back did not frighten before that to change all other all around.
That permitted us to transform in the course of our first century, the technologies, the business and also the company.
We hope, create that we in the next hundred years yet more", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the business out of occasion of the anniversary.
Thought out system
Watson operated already social care of its employed in the thirties years - in similar manner, like the entrepreneur in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had paid vacation, an insurance as one of the first American employed through the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as a work garment and a thought out remuneration system for best innovator and dealer.
Just as contrived are also the long-term relations of IBM with its customers.
The business was from the beginning brilliantly in the talent support - as one of the first firms worldwide lifted IBM each discrimination on - and accordingly was able to choose itself.
In harmony with this antidiscrimination strategy, also the present plan, the Palmisan is alternated becomes at the tip by IBM in the next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty.
That is took in already thirty years in IBM there, previously it the position of the Vetriebs-, marketing boss and strategy boss.
IBM makes so-called Online brainstormings in the last years, out of which many future strategies and innovations maturely.
No wonder - there are is busied ideas enough, in the business almost a half million people.
An institution with good call
Your imperturbable position in the business guarantees the business a strong image and according to this interior and outward.
"From the beginning had IBM sooner the draft of an institution, than a bare technology business", said Economist the professor of the Harvard businesses School and the author of a beech over IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is no technology business, but rather a firm, the business problems with the help of of technologies solve helps", joined George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research thereto.
How the business itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be on the market only presently or to form it through this presence directly.
IBM - in because of the countries of its Logos informally "Big Blue" named, is grown up in a century to one of the largest businesses of the world.
It is one of the most multilateral technologies businesses generally - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation achievements in an incredible product width - from servers to there to the nano technology.
Of all technology business of American IBM possesses were priced most patents and already five of its colleagues with the Nobel Prize.
To its best known inventions, for example bank vending machines, credit cards, finance wap, stroke code or also the diskette belong.
With ca. IBM was 220 billions of dollar stock exchange value (market capitalization) this year the second largest technology business (same after Apple) whereby it overtook for the first time since 1996 Microsofts.
The view ahead
All products and innovations did not encounter the taste of the customers of today - unfortunately were for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the Online services Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, therefore may one itself not emotionally at the past bind", means in addition Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem to build its reason wall on different platforms - and if they do not function to leave it also again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft that in principle with its operating system Windows stands and falls.
Promising technologies
At the profits of IBM take part involve in largest mass of services, software and hardware itself to respectively one-fifth.
At the same time was represented yet 1990 hardware with a more than fifty percent share in the strongest.
Since 2000 IBM little profit sold invested assets throwing off in the value of 15 billion dollars, in which same time it however 58 billions of dollar of technologies seminal into the purchase.
In this Investionen, IBM continues also after 2008 when the modern finance crisis swept for the first time such as a storm over the world.
Also here IBM remained the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson faithful, that middle in the large world economic crisis its investment circumference increased.
Previously it seems that the business overcomes IBM the current crisis in spite of.
The value of the IBM shares increased since 2008 rockets-like around 120 percent and the net profit of the business are awake kontinuell.
The business slogan of IBM reads: everything can be changed - only the values not.
Also therefore may be expected that this flexible giant masters also the next crisis.
IBM story: Of the cheese tailor to universe flights
The company established one hundred years ago in New York IBM (internationally business Machines) had at the beginning a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording corporation.
It received originally concerned the name IBM first 1924 - it a brand-name label for an agency in Canada and South America.
The fusion of four businesses, whose story go back into the 80 to years of the 19th century, put the cornerstone to the later company IBM.
They possessed technologies such as for example the famous Stechkartenuhren to the registration of the work start and -endes.
To the architect of this new business, Charles Ranlett Flint, that had also the chair in the supervisory board until 1930 in, became.
And it was Flint, that the boss of the rival company Thomas J. Watson adjusted so that it this helped in the direction of the business.
This Leader placed then even the founders of IBM in the shadow - on Watson's it ideas is based until today the invincible culture and identity of the business.
Watson led the business until 1952.
IBM, began how already the name betrays, with the manufacture and the sales and marketing of all possible machines for the trade - of sausage and cheese tailors, up to cash registers.
In the first four decades, in which Watson led the firm, it doubled its revenues on nine million dollars and the business expanded gradually on all continents.
Watson was for the firm so indispensable that it sat entire for forty years in the boss armchair, first then became it of its son, Thomas Watson junior removed.
Under whose direction IBM began to work at the development of artificial intelligence and developed also the first programming language.
In the '60's technician and computer of IBM of the NASA flights in that helped all to lead - to the mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of the person to the moon.
Meanwhile IBM in 1964 developed the first computer family with same computer architecture - the row IBM system/360.
A classic PC, that determined the computer standard of that time, came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
IBM later sold twenty years its computer production at the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand it bought however the consul aunt part of the business PricewaterhouseCoopers and climbed with this fully and entirely into the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high value-added on.
The strategy, that itself IBM in the last three years pays is the draft "Smarter planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies in smart manner in not yet once planned areas, for example also to the improvement of the situation in the traffic and in the city administration.
In the trade sector, IBM introduced recently the platforms "Smarter commerces", that should help the dealers to lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong story also in the Czech Republic.
IBM established already 1932 an agency in the at that time Czechoslovakia - as a generally first country in central Europe and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM operates among other things also a strategic Outsourcing center in Br√ºnn.
The headquarters for central Europe and Eastern Europe settles in Prague and here is also a Top researcher team of world level that with the technology of the voice recognition is concerned.
