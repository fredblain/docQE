In accordance with the statements of PREP, the difference between the first and the second place amounts to in the choice of the governor nearly 27 percent whereby 879 voices were not counted out of altogether 6074 yet.
The possibility of the single counting of the ballot is this year in the choices in Michoacán a reality, for in accordance with the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place amounts to in the governor choices nearly 27 percent whereby 879 voices were not counted out of altogether 6074 yet.
In this sense, the president of the Consejo general del Instituto Electoral has de Michoacán (IEM), María de loosely Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, remembers that just once at the past 9th of November the choice place had dismissed a row of regulations to the harmonization of the local directions with the reforms of the states in choice matters.
It would be remembered that Michoacán had adapted neither its political constitution nor its choice law yet its law over the choice justice to the reforms dismissed by the congress, so that these had not stepped in this choice round effective. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the country indicator within the time periods planned for that with the argument still to have objections on the other hand.
On the 9th of November, the colonel of court Mexico (SCJN) decided the voice of the country delegates to the constitution reforms over the constitution complaints submitted by the local legislature and judged as "invalidly and illegally" because this would not be right the to "to conclude about that or to insert" a veto on the other hand.
María de loosely Ángeles Llanderal declared in an interview over the possibility of the single counting of the voices that thanks to the acceptance of the guidelines through the Consejo general del IEM now the possibility would exist, that the local choice authority could count out the ballots partially or completely.
So that cannot under the following conditions in one or several choice packages contained voices partially counted out become the results in the protocols agree unanimously; the protocol over the voice counting and -calculation does not exist act moderate not or it is in the possession of the chairperson of the choice committee or it gives obvious mistakes or alterations in the protocols.
Moreover the entire counting of the completely filled out polling cards can result then if there are a difference between the presumed winner and that that stands on the second place,, that same or more slightly than an one percent is, prefaced lies at the beginning of the session a specific proposal of the party bzw. coalition chairperson before, whom the second of the named candidates is.
The voice counting can result also in its entirety if after conclusion of the orderly calculation assessed becomes, that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate is on the second place same or more slightly than an one percent, prefaced lies it a specific proposal of a representative of the party whose candidate second became, before. In this case, the choice packages that were stopped a partial counting would be excluded.
Worth mentioning is that the choices are in Morelia in the same situation, where in accordance with PREP the difference between the first and the second place amounts to nearly 0.16 percent, although the voices were not counted out of 129 of altogether 923 choice protocols yet.
