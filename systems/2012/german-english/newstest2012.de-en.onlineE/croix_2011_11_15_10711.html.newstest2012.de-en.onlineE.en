Why does the unemployment rate of more hindered more employed remain on so high level?
Approximate 19% of the hindered people are on search for a job.
Today that begins" 15th week of the work for hindered".
In spite of a purposeful public politics, that was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate is with hindered people always doubly as high as the average average: 19% contrary to 9% Arbeitlosigkeit of the entire population.
Discouraging?
"No, so Éric Blanchet, general director of the union emphasizes aligns Adapt, that the" week of the work for hindered"".
"That within of fifteen years progress obtained are considerable".
"At that time the unemployment rate was not double, but rather triply so highly".
"Nevertheless much to do" remains yet enormously.
It must be said however that for the hindered unemployed further numerous hindrances remain, before they get a job.
More frequently it encounters the older: 37% are older than a 50 years (17% in the average).
They control a slight qualification level: No graduation examination and it have be 80% of them only 10,000 hindered under the 2.3 million students with higher development conclusion.
In conclusion also the long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in the hindered vis-à-vis 38% in the entire cut.
In short there are so many criteria that impede a renewed work entry, and that that "kernel of the problem form", so Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, a 1992 established union who is helpful business there to recruit hindered employed.
So much to the objective brakes.
The unspoken, the spirit bearings, that remains develop further itself to be sure certainly, but yet slowly.
A study carried out in April by the union IMS Entreprendre for the periodical La Cité indicated, the questioned managers have would be "a weak knowledge level regarding hindered", that "over-represented" "of people in wheelchairs, psychically or intellectually Minderbemittelten".
Result is that the private businesses with more have than 20 colleagues another far way before itself, around the position goal of 6% hindered employed, which became festival written in a law by 1987, to obtain.
These last-named, from the year 2008 coming numbers refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
"We find us now in about 3%", reports Pierre Blanc, general director of Agefiph, the organization who is delegated therewith to collect contributions of business, that neglect this law.
The proof: The number" fees more paying" business sites has just as as the sum of the deposited sums between 2007 and 2011 diminished itself, and to be sure of 59,000 on 46,000 (and of 606 on 480 million Euro).
"The law of 2005 which contribution increase plans, created a strong pressure on the businesses, explained Pierre Blanc".
"But this improvement expresses also a real insight especially at the firm groups".
According to the ministry for work, only 59% of the business sites between 20 and 49 colleagues hindered employed, business with 100 to 199 colleagues busy on the other hand 82%.
