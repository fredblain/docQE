EU ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of Negativisten and Euro skeptic
"The contract of Lisbon brought" the balance under the single institutions perceptible out of the Lot.
I would not have expected, flare up that such a hard war".
"It becomes five, six years last, until itself the wave smoothed and itself all at its new roll accustomed have become", began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador in the European Union, quite sharply its presentation at the juristic faculty.
How seriously it takes the motto "intelligibly and openly over Europe", it showed already in the first part of its presentation, in which it succeeded you to describe the single organs of the EU and its mutual relations on a such manageable and intelligible manner that it so many a lecturer of the juristic faculty of the Karl university can would have envy therefore.
Woman Vicenová praised at the same time also the new permanent chairperson of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"Originally criticism became would be loud, he inconspicuously - a gray official, who had not grown such a roll, but I must say, it has all the breath cunningly how well he took on the thing.
"It is a person who brings it ready to listen twenty-seven member countries patient, to communicate with them and the presentations clear above all therefrom has how it should go on with the EU.
The new position of the high representative for foreign matters and security policy explained it then as an answer to the question: Who is that actual - the European Union? Should which number I call"?, therefore as an important step to the unification and better legibilitys of the EU politics vis-à-vis countries, e.g. China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our Ölmützer Quargel
Woman Vicenová dedicated lived herself also the agenda, in accordance with that the European Union, lives and thought to live in the near future.
It designated the Czech chair of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the finance crisis and the gas crisis and would have arranged also the summit meeting for eastern partnership.
The case of the government during the chair designated it as a large Negativum, that strongly had damaged the image of the Czech republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has presently all hands fully to do.
With the words of the ambassador said, went it not only in the chair, but rather also in the subsequent crisis, that is overcome until today not yet, quite hectically to.
And there yet the seven-year-budget of the EU must be approved, what the thing makes just because of the current economic situation much complicated.
Whether it becomes a slim and thrifty budget, which branches of the economy receive precedence, which countries more and which fewer promoted become - all this stands now on the order of the day.
The ambassador reminds one also of its own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligibly over Europe".
"If I somewhat do not like, are it grayish shorthand symbols, foreign words and specialty jargon that no one understands.
How I actually should know as a citizen whether one devises in Brussels really crooked or round cucumber and differently large bananas or whether actually someone wants to forbid us the Quargel.
It would have used the ground of the EU also gladly in addition in order to got more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of that two or different speeds in outlook
The Czechs in the call stand in the opinion of the EU ambassador, to be Euro skeptic, who perceive more the negative, than the positive sides of the thing.
More all the more annoyinger is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
On that many factors guilt are not, among other things also the restraint of our candidates whose inabilities to write, motivation letters and finally also the weak support of the Czech side.
Except the successful Czech chair, it lifted also the power and collaboration of the Visegrad group, that so-called. V4 forth.
"You believe me if a pole or Ungar to me comes and is a Slowake in the vicinity, mean the Frenchman next to me: "He, what sticks its there the heads together - is that already again your V4?" and there makes a rather sour countenance.
Woman according to Vicenové the EU in the future expect above all hard rules for the budget politics of the member countries.
As much more honest, than a "European federation" it looks at the draft of a Europe of that two or quite different speeds.
"We the countries of the Eurozone and the countries have here to one side of the Eurozone.
"We have have the Schengen room and we already the institute of a strengthened collaboration".
"For the first time was said that only the countries should collaborate, that want it and that that do not want it, should quietly to one side of stand".
"There will be more and more such institutions, runs out what in the end on a strong" Europe of the different speeds"", expects woman Vicenová.
In this regard, it lauded discussed will must also the roll of the Czech republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the execution of the principle, according to that all subjects with effect on the entire EU by all member countries and not only by the countries of the Eurozone.
