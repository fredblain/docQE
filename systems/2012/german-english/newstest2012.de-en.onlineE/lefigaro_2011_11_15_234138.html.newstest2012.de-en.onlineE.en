The world of the republican presidency candidates
Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry avoided compete in Simplifizierung and ignorance regarding China, Iraq as well as the aid position for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America not lead a complex world with simple to say around: naive ideas?
If one listens so to the republican presidency candidate, the voters could get almost this impression.
Since some days let avoided Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and its comrade-in-arms its thundering explanations as well as its Statements regarding that focal point traditional republican, repeatedly disclose.
Over China, the Iran and the Israel aid fall - frequently in keinster manner bolstered - slogans.
That with respect to the appointment of the "Grand Old party" most highly in the course standing Romney avoided threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse it that" currency manipulation" - leading subject in an America, that through the migration of entire branches of industry to Asia on that excited is -.
Stupidly run if this should imply the initiating of a trade war, said it.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and only candidate, who seems to have a matured vision of, untied themselves nearly with respect to its behavior flattering the emotions the air.
It had called to a strong, but constructive conversation exchange with Beijing (also the current bearing Obamas).
But Huntsman is not granted because it stagnates in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's it likeness
Romney had praised also military blows against the Irans if the sanctions should fail to the Stoppung of the nuclear program.
"If I selected would become, command I the Iran restraint", had tinted it.
Obama "is re-elected, they get the bomb".
It promised Israel aid reinforced military and accused Obama to have remained vis-à-vis obligations indebted to this partner.
A disgraceful act ignorance to the show the entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest placed candidate, carries for its part.
Recently it called would try in addition to give the Chinese military threat Kontra, there Beijing" to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to let at the same time the fact eight that China has been already since 1964 in the possession more militarily atomic weapons!
To be the Texan governor Rick Perry, that Israel supports and military blows against the Irans demands, for its part, in addition ready, to take the American army in Mexico against drugs cartels in service.
That of Obama 2009 prohibited recourse to vis-à-vis terrorist Michele stream man was advocated also of Cain, Perry as well as the candidate ions.
One far is removed of John McCain, the republican candidate in 2008, a heavy-weight.
The current presidency contractors toward, Reagan had had also simple presentations and had won the cold war in spite of all that.
They call in memory that also Obama selbstein amateur would be and had to give water into its wine, what concerned the subject anti-terrorist.
They persist to right on the fiasco of its naive dialogue with the Iran, the hasty deduction its" boy" out of Iraq, its irresolution in Libya what brought in it also the call of the weakness.
This Anfeindung is to be sure not very so unconstrained.
The population appreciates am turned off has sooner the positive balances of the national security under Obama, that store.
Since Iraq, she is wary of military interventions, that lead to the Erlahmen.
And Obama surprises more appropriate in that it argues, America economically would have to be reconstructed in order to awake its lead to new life.
