Massenschlachtung on a personal plain
Perceptively and generous Peter begins book new Englunds "beauty and frights. A story of the first world war, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of head people, that goes one too heart.
Here a tip, how one advance could: Cut out this side carefully and make it to your bookmark.
They will become acquainted with these people in Englunds romanhafter story very well. And these head people will function as your GPS when lighthouse in this few moments in which you are lost like Englunds men and women in the fog of the war and are robbed your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is moreover the new permanent secretary of the Swedish academy that determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
It wrote an unusual book, that it does not describe incorrect as an "a work of the Anti story".
It contains only few names large, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassador, racing reporters or discussions over tactic and equipment.
It is fewer a book about that what happened, explains it, but rather sooner "a book about, how it was". It is about "feelings, imprinting, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and frights" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, of schoolgirl and botanists up to mountain climber, physicians, ambulance driver and office employee.
Some of these people become heros.
Some become war prisoner, lose limb, will displace or die.
Each of these life flickers on like the Votivkerzen in a church, some come thereto while other extinguish.
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.
It corrected had been moreover the presentation, the first world war only the devastating position war at the west front.
"Beauty and frights" hikes with expert view over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkan Peninsula, the east front, Mesopotamia, east Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, bee baskets fall celebrates, one Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an unsolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war inundates life of these people such as a natural disaster how a hurricane Katrina that smells after Kordit.
Imagine, you are hears a woman who is with its children at home, and canon fire in the distance. Do you remain or seize the flight?
Who comes generally?
Hardly anyone understands, what is happened or is waged war why this generally.
"Missing facts", assesses Englund, "became with suppositions, acceptances, hopes, anxieties, quick ideas, conspiracy theories, dream, nightmares and rumors revamped".
"Beauty and frights" follows single people such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard stump, a young German ship sailor.
Your stories were taken main memories, letters and other already published material.
Your life reports can be frightening or seizing, but they are extremely living in Englunds of the aggregation losing in details of small moments.
Many of them are itself about deficiency and stopgaps.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, it tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement".
"Coffee substitute, incorrect aluminum, incorrect eraser, paper associations, wood buttons".
It tells more of the replacement meal in Germany.
It describes "meat that made out of pressed rice and in Hammelfett baked became (and finally with an incorrect bone out of wood served became), tobacco, that was made out of dried roots and dried potato scarves, shoes, that with wood sole were".
There was how it notes, "837 registered nourishment replacement means, that in the manufacture of sausage permits were, 511 registered coffee replacement means".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes its own pressure to the wildness and says over the war: "One feels that that is in spite of all that, what to sit planned was sooner for men than in the armchair, to do with the evening newspaper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand, and so, as would mean such a facade civilization and as would give it no barbarism behind the own strengthened and covered shirt breast".
Reversed recognizes a British soldier that he probably die and no one would take therefrom notice or would be concerned therefore.
"If one of the thought, itself to sacrifice, distance takes, would like one think, that this before an audience happens", writes it.
Instead of its it is became" as terrible as "a convicted man, that in the secret hanged.
Other observations are about the old Europe, that falls apart, and over new types of the terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest", writes Englund, "a war between the factories".
It catches the arrival its, what it names "a new species in the Bestiarium of the yet young century" : Measure murderers turned and ideologically convinced "the words in the measure suit who slaughters while he sits" behind a desk.
People behave gives on unforeseen type and manner and it just as frivolous behavior such as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect itself at a prostitute with a venereal disease, in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression its can in the trade with Gonokokken pus discovers become, for soldiers bought and itself on its genital greased, in the hope, so into the hospital to come", writes he.
"That that really were doubted rubbed it into the eyes, what led in addition, that they were" blind the remainder of its life.
In this translation out of the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englunds poetry becomes pliant and yet unobtrusive and fits itself perfectly at its human task on.
In dozens of small scenes, it catches unleashed the type and manner, like the war "in unique manner uncontrollable powers: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate".
The people begin to ask themselves why its leaders bring it for fighting.
The best books over the first world war were was usually sooner falsified like Paul Fussells "Great and modern memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "in the west nothing new" as extensive history books.
Englunds volume joins an unorthodox renown hall.
Its book has devastating that end of which I read ever in a non-fiction book.
I yield it no longer.
But it is, would have snatched away us as it with its book this side with the head people before the nose and ignited with a match.
