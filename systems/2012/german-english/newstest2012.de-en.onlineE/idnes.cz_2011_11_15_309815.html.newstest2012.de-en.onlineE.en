Maintain pro - a stylist must be also a good psychologist
In the initiating article about how stylists learn, had moaned I a little that that was a little too much material for the beginning.
There I did not suspect in the slightest, what yet comes.
Presentations of three pros out of the industry, that garment of problematic figures and a seminar about how that runs "on the place".
It yet more badly should come.
The more closely the test moves, all more the more more information and practical tasks are forthcoming us.
But also if the course takes place every Saturdays and Sunday, it fully is covered nevertheless.
This time we debated with director Alena (at the course takes no single man part) how one dresses a woman, who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And those are nevertheless that of us.
The one have boy stick are a too short neck, the other one too figure without orderly curves and again others cozy.
It is the thing of the stylist to conceal wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or the necessary curves do magic forth.
We got dresses also tips, like one a woman type such as Jennifer Lopez - therefore with large breast, wide hip and narrow waist - lovely and figure emphasized, without that it causes all too provokativ.
If for example the difference between waist and hips is so large, that the skirt or the pair of pants really does not fit, one should let himself at least a piece after measure tailors.
One not certainly will regret that, for well sitting clothing is simply prohibitively expensive.
In such a tailor-made skirt, one feels namely much better, than in one of the pole, that slips continually highly and, in the waist stands off, etc.
Jungenhafte figures can permit themselves again to carry garment with folds, billowing, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
In this quantity of information and figure types, I am happily that I have an entire week time let go myself all thoroughly through the head.
And nevertheless I have anxiety that it to is not to be created in view of the applied homework almost.
Each of the course participants got allotted namely a Promi, contrive should for the Outfits suitable it - day garment and evening gown.
At the same time we should consider the present appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I should "dress" Miranda Kerr, know that you possibly out of the campaign Victoria's it Secret.
In the interior, I rejoice, for that is for me personal much better to dress than for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, that increased recently probably at the hundred kilos, (well good, that is a little exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments out of periodicals or should seek on the Internet, print out and process subsequently graphic.
In the "Moodboard" how the entire result is named, should come then our entirely personal style and our relation to the graphic formation to the expression.
It is namely very important, also to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.
The stylist pulls the Models namely not only purely physically on, but rather also the so-called product site in the journals (after concrete specification, for example trend purses, coats, etc.) forms.
Therefrom told us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that first on Sunday.
That is that a stylist must have a good entire overview.
The Saturday presentation filled with information about figure types was spiced immediately by three visitors out of the industry:
Of the stylist Jan Pokorný, of the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and of the fashion photographer Ben.
Jakub remembered us that fashion illusion is and that should be a stylist able to exploit this.
And sent in stylist is able to do to work with a single garment piece on entirely different manner.
The magic word is named variability.
So one can lived carry for example a trenchcoat how over the jeans, therefore like a T Shirt or coat, one can carry it however also on the naked body, can dress paragraph shoes in addition and carry it as a dress.
It passes to roll up the sleeves or the collar and immediately the entire Look sees very differently from.
"Plays therewith", emphasized it.
Most came lain me however the following advice: "First perfectly must know" its the rules.
"First then may it it injure", said Jakub.
Finally becomes clearly why we must study all these theorems, what one with what combine can and why, also to me if one gets to see other in fashion journal frequently entirely.
Of fashion shows very to are quiet.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know now that a stylist must have prepared much more garment variants, than he in the end photographs.
Therefore one must be prepared for a Fashion story with ten sides (sprich ten Outfits) on that, at least fifteen to stylen.
And also, that the garment looks on the photo in combination with further accessory sometimes very differently, than in reality.
With all that, one must calculate therefore in the formation of the Outfits.
That image and Styl settle sometimes the half of the success, that confirmed us also Jan Pokorný.
There one needs himself only once madonna to look at a not exactly brilliant singer, out of whom image and marketing made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, one stands reserves the services of a stylist sooner vis-à-vis.
Also confessed consider personalities this frequently to be out thrown money (the essential matter is, that I something would bring, like I there would look is secondary).
And if already someone lets herself of us stylen, we should calculate therewith that it or it forces us with large probability an entirely other (smaller) size, when it or it needs in reality.
Then one needs subsequently only to googlen in order to assess with security that the popular press writes, the corresponding Promi would have again to or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday at the heart, to believe not that a stylist to focus himself only on the fashion and needs "to assemble" then the Outfit.
In its work, he must communicate above all with the people, must be that he stylt and he a crafty psychologist.
People estimate, stand without itself anzubiedern and to its opinion.
"If any manager orders us in order to sight its closet and in order to supplement pretty pieces, can clear and say we its not the entire closet - my God, that am yes terrible".
"One must at least a couple of things commendable find, to which one recommends, what one in addition carry can", says Mario.
It showed us also very concretely, what must include such a so named "place pocket".
Therefore so a pocket that one carries one at the waist zuknöpft and in that all necessary proprieties with itself.
Except such clear things, like scissors, Abroller to that hair distant or security needles it does not abstain also such utensils, like a nylon thread (therewith helps the stylist in the photographing of products, like purses or watching out of), special Clips, with which behind the clothing is snatched up, if it is to largely (pin or other clamps are prohibits, therewith the material broken goes) and naturally vicinity thing.
So that we however not only must listen, but rather also somewhat practically try can, learned we how one really lower glues shoes.
Also in the photographing in the studio where the floor is even, one can damage the sole, not to mention that outside.
O we glued and glued ourselves...
With the scissors, one may not touch the shoes once so that one does not damage it.
Therefore one must really sent advance.
Mario delighted me in that it praised my "creation" without restrictions.
The mentioned skill is namely not straight my strength.
All this was only the fraction of that what we got to hear in at the second Wochenend continuation course.
One clearly became in the meantime to me - on professional level to dedicate itself to the Styling, is no children's game.
