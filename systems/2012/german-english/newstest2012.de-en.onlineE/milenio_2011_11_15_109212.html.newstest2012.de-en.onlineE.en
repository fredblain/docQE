The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President Italy tomorrow in order to introduce this the new government, that the crisis, that led Italy at the edge of the economy breakdown, that should offer forehead.
A communication out of the presidency palace announced appointed meet would become, that that on Sunday Monti on Wednesday with the president of the state, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm the formation of a government.
It is assumed that it will introduce a cabinet put together by a majority out of technocrats, although yet clear is not, when the new Prime Minister will begin its office.
Monti said, it would introduce the president of the state the results of the conversations with the political parties to the formation of a government.
"I would like my absolute confidence into the capacity of our country, with these difficult times finished to become, strengthen", said the former EU commissioner the journalist.
Monti did not confirm goes specifically the formation of a government, but out of its commentaries forth that the hindrances are overcome.
That "frame now well is demarcated", joined it thereto.
Monti created it in less than three days to form a government, that is much less time than normal. In the meantime Italy against a political and financial crisis, that drove the costs for the guilt into an intolerable height, fights.
The new government led by the former EU commissioner Monti must dismiss a hard austerity package, that was demanded by the Euro politicians, in order to recover the marred confidence in Italy.
The pressure to that hurries, grown stronger that weighs on Monti, yet through the fluctuating market condition, as a result of which the Italian government bonds were burdened for 10 years with 7 percent interests. That corresponds to the state, with which Greece and Ireland saw forced themselves, to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria announced the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said would support" we this government after all powers.
We believe that this government is the last chance, so that Italy comes out out of this need situation.
The chances of success Montis considerably were enlarged through the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, that had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe, that the exertions of the professor Monti in addition determines are, good results to induce", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-to the right-party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is talked things out essential, for until now many of its members against a government existing by a majority out of technocrats, that just forms Monti.
Support of the parliament
The new government of Monti requires a strong parliamentary support to the conversion of the probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance against its exertions or the out hesitation of the reforms could cause again a devastating attack of the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks exercises would be with its reference, a failure Montis a catastrophe, also pressure.
Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, labor unions and entrepreneur associations as well as with youth organizations and woman organizations.
Tuesday evening is supposed to be locked the session round.
Monti was appointed this Sunday of Napolitano, that started an extremely fast government change as an answer to the crisis.
After short sigh of relief toward the end of that last week when well known became, that Berlusconi would resign, reached as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister the costs for the Italian government bonds again critical boundaries.
A rescue of Italy with a country guilt in height of 1.8 trillion Euro, would be too much for the present EU rescue screen.
Monti said, its government would must to the next choices, that are held off presumably in 2013, last, in spite of the predictions that the politicians will give it only time to the conversion of the reforms to prefer in place of the choices.
Monti expressed, it would include gladly politician in its cabinet, but the large parties exist on that that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to its objections in view of the of the pressure of the financial markets imposed procedure.
Political sources refer on that that the mutual mistrust and the disagreement between the parties make the inclusion of people out of the political life in a complicated way.
