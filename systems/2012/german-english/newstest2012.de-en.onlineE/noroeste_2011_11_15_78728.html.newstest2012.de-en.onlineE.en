The colonel of court Mexico (SCJN) shwas will must the constitution complaints, that were submitted by the senate and the house of representatives against the presidential directive, and on the basis of that the switch from analogous to digital signals of 2021 on 2015 embarrassed, based on missing eight voices, that are required to the law attack, back.
A minority of four ministers, under that also the president the colonel court, Juan Silva Meza, was would have the view, the Präsident Felipe Calderón its responsibility not exceeded when he published the law decree with the details over the switch on the terrestrial digital television.

These matters, emphasized it, "made the actions of the entire system required, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction through the country of included it a group of features, that the constitution into the hands of the centrally national government would put".
It called into the memory that many countries already would have carried out worldwide the digital transposition, and to be sure over the government, although it over highly specialized arrangements of ordered.
