North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline north Stream, that passes on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects the western Europe directly with Russia, was set in operation.
It should gas for an equivalently of 30 million households deliver.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with brightness and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, under that four heads of state and heads of the government, attended last Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under Orchesterbeschallung and in Feinschmeckerbuffet the inaugural of the new gas pipeline north Stream, that interconnects Russia and Germany below sea level directly.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, that Russian Präsident Dmitri Medwedew, the French prime minister François Fillon as well as its office colleague mark Rutte out of the Netherlands have symbolic would prove the tax the valve jointly turned, which conveys the Russian gas into the west european network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billions of cubic meter of additional Russian gas are supposed to be delivered by a first piping of 1,224 km lengths, that connects the region Saint Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, to Western Europe per year.
A second piping, that allows an entire delivery of 55 billion cubic meters gas - that equivalently the French entire consumption - is supposed to be placed end 2012 ready.
And one lets be discernable already the eventuality of the building of a third direction on self stretch.
For Gazprom, the timely and point exact completion of this enormous building such as a victory causes.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic countries.
The north-Stream-pipeline will enable namely a direct gas delivery to Germany, and to be sure under avoidance of each line course through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the country way.
For this reason lose both countries a few of its power: For it, it becomes now more difficult to exert pressure on Russia in that they threaten to close the access to west european markets.
Warsaw, most strongly in the debate engages, was not before that back shy to compare the north-Stream-pipeline to a "new German sowietischen pact" in involvement at the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means, politically seen is that the subject sensitive.
Western Europe won an even higher provision security through the approval of this Russian project.
This however on costs of a debility of European energy because the project struck a breach between west European and east European.
Russia brought it in hardly five years ready, its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and that pass to put through western countries, that show strong gas consumption and whose gas occurrence draws to a close.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery, that us on organic type and manner connects", confirmed are important François Fillon in the inaugural of the gas pipeline in that it referred on that, in which straight the gas contracts also of political and economic side.
All this declared the wide smile of the Gazprom manager represented in Lubmin in great numbers with respect to the gas pipeline.
The building of this gas pipeline is also an exceptional technology.
The lower water pipe consists of steel with concrete casing, that should protect it against Schiffsankern.
It rests on the seabed, in approximately 200 ms depth.
In its building had to be avoided out of the second world war dating mine fields.
"About hunderte mines as a precaution had to remove or destroyed become", gave Jens Müller, speaker of the company north Stream, on.
Reinforced had to be seized to the protection of the fauna and Flora.
The direction is a long snake out of metal, heavily like 242 Eiffeltürme, that is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither through valves, yet maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible took therefrom distance because the Sweden were eager few on that to see establish themselves a Russian country company on permanent type and manner on height of its coasts.
"In the case a loss by sea close we the gas passage in less than a minute", specified Jens Müller.
In the case a leak, the gas present itself in the gas pipeline escapes therefore into the air.
This case probably is looked at of the designers however as only few because that was estimated to be a constancy by a leak per 100,000 years.
The national supervision of the gas pipeline becomes both guarantees of a lower water robot, that is driven to external Observationszwecken by a lake ship out of, how also of a device, that circulates in the interior of the gas pipeline.
It possesses the form of a cigar, a meter of diameter, is introduced the piping in that in and moves away through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of the locomotion through the direction in a speed of 3 meters per second, delivers the device information most exact in its arrival about possible deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was conceived subjected become in order to function for fifty years, without so much as the slightest repair to must.
The gas circulation is guaranteed very simply through pressure.
This amounts to 200 cash at the access, 100 cash at the exit point.
Five companies united its powers to the realization of this project.
The direction leadership remains however in the hand of Gazprom, that holds 51% of the shares.
Further the German companies are incorporated here E. ON and BASF (ever to 15,5%), just as as the Dutch gas university and the French firm group GDF suez (ever to 9%).
These five companies formed a business partnership, that names itself north Stream and that is delegated with the building as well as business of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland where the taxation is especially favorable.
Gazprom rented then this company the entire capacity of its gas carrier, and to be sure on verlängerbaren twenty-year-contract.
"Gazprom becomes for the entire capacity pay, equal like that honestly would transport gas quantity precipitates", specified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline building was protected to 30% of stockholders as well as to 70% through bank lending.
The entire cost of labor should amount to itself on 7.4 billion Euro for both pipings.
For GDF suez the investment sum amounted to for example 240 million.
The minority stockholders are to be overtaken here themselves however its expense again because Gazprom carries alone the liability risk.
The gas pipeline steps at a sandy coast stroke wooded with jaws in Lubmin out of the Baltic Sea to light.
Valves high the 4.5 meters form the gas retirement gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and further indices of the arriving gas before this is forwarded into the German gas pipelines.
For last Tuesday this terminal with a million cubic meter of Russian gas is supplied per slipping away hour.
In full capacity, these would be 3 million cubic meters per hour as well as 6 millions per years 2012.
