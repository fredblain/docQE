Energy politics:
Facts should win over dogmas
If a subject exists that on basis by short-term views or on the basis of emotions treated will not may, this is certainly the energy politics.
Availability and costs of the electricity influence the buying power as well as the competitive stature of the businesses in direct.
It is sensible to take a choice meeting to the occasion, to think about this subject as well as over the position of the atomic energy.
The debate will carry only then fruits if it probes the entirety of more economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed option.
The Frenchmen should underpin its opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billions of person are on this planet, the demographic evolution pushes a doubling of the electricity demand to the year 2050, should forgo must not an enormous share of the world population a vital element.
Simultaneously one must soften the shortage of the fossilized resources in order to be able to produce further steadily electricity, without forgetting the compelling necessity to the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions, a subject disappeared out of the ecological debate,, in order to struggle against climatic.
The accident of Fukushima changes no this parameter.
Therefore blebt Germany further in its decision isolates to forgo nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, that subjects its decision of the necessity, of finding a substitutionsfähige replacement source, yet in Switzerland, that intends just once only nuclear power plants of the last generation to construct.
Finland, Poland, the Czech republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil in order to name only some countries, pursue its projects on the other hand further with determination.
The United States concluded would paint take on their part after Fukushima to incorporate its park a further unit, in that it the work shut down after the atom accident Three Iceland again in operation.
Also if the model directed, German on renewable energy sources is placed occasionally as an example, reality contradicts however the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will find expression in form of an increase of the electricity price, a dependence reinforced energetic by the increased recourse to import gas especially of Russia, a climb of that of CO2-Emissionen caused by gas power plants and coal power plants.
The entirety of these unpleasant effects noticeably will make itself already within less months.
The case Denmark gives occasion for meditation.
Denmark is on the one hand European table leader with respect to wind power, out of which it relates 30% of its electricity, on the other hand the country of one of the strongest users of coal and gas is used, alternating with wind power; aufgrunddessen are its CO2-Ausstösse as well as its electricity price respectively around 65% and 50% higher than the average value corresponding European.
Thanks to the constancy of our energy politics, our neighbors pay one in contrast to our French households around 40% higher electricity calculation.
Because the energy price in the globalized economy represents a key roll of the competitive stature as well as a Stabilitätspfand of the industry on national ground, the französichen businesses have an advantage based on the most favorable electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction regarding the nuclear power would stretch therefore a strong growing of the energy price after, what let say become the noble about the Reindustrialisierung of our country and the defense of the buying power the illusion.
Surveys yielded that that would be a price to pay that the majority of the Frenchmen just as few ready is how it lets recognize resistance against the principle of this energy source.
Let's imagine us that the energy politics of our country enabled it to construct a branch of industry jobs direct and 410,000 induced with 125.00.
Based on its strong export character, it brings an enormous quantity of specialized small and middle-class businesses on the international markets and makes this of jobs innumerable to creators.
If France should grasp the decision to get off of the nuclear power, would fall victim that a this KMU, and the annual 6 billions of Euro at capital goods export and atomic energy export would dwindle more and more.
Which electrician would delegate an EPR conceived for functioning on sixty years if the decline of its maker is preprogrammed?
To solve around the energetic equation one must clear that there is just as few a like a devil work a miracle means to the production of electricity.
That of the firm Areva developed, CO2-armen solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy witness of the complementarity of the energy sources.
To received the highest possible security level uprightly an absolute imperative is for the nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent inspections in already existing works such as for example at the building in Flamanville.
Whose work teams, that made itself based on its professionalism a name, are of the security presentation just to possessed.
Within 50 years, the kernel industry experienced three serious disturbances.
Only a more only, and to be sure in Three Iceland would paint, entered under normal operating conditions; so it passed without consequences for person and environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama through reactor construction as well as unendschuldbares, human failure was conjured up.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident never was evoked by two natural disasters existence size, that caused death of several ten thousand people.
The kernel industry will pull its apprenticeships just as out of this accident how it had done according to this both preceded.
As a fruit of this procedure as well as a cooperation of the security authorities the French and German operators and designer of nuclear power plants, represents the EPR a design, that enables it robustness vis-à-vis such phenomena.
Because it is considered under the electrical engineer as desirable, to build a nuclear power plant, a building stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift at the competition of Areva and EDF in that one would let them clear track to tear the lead in the unavoidable nuclear power development at itself.
It is indispensable and legitimate to search for the best Energiebouquet for our country, however it would be irresponsible, emotions let dominate dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate, the just as economic, social and financial situation of our country determiniert.
