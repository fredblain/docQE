Athens lets arise again doubt
Papadimos says, that dismissed would become savings measures, but the conservatives will sign no written agreement
With the risk premiums driven into the height of the peripheral countries and extend making uncertainty Greece gets lost itself also further in the maze that out of the large European guilt crisis leads out.
The impression that the "consent" of the new Greek transition government is sooner a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political powers, is covered slowly through facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, referred yesterday on that, that there would be no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the days arranged hundred in its appointment would be possibly too short for its conversion, assured of the leaders of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that he support the new savings measures and in no case its demand of new choices to the planned date, that 19th of February would turn back.
"The most important task of this government is the conversion of the decisions, that on the summit of the 26th of October encountered became", assured Papadimos yesterday the opening of a parliamentary debate, that will reach tomorrow with the confidence vote for the new government its highpoint.
A package with 24 programs to the employment support, to the reform of the Disziplinarrechts for official and new measures against the tax evasion the first initiatives are.
Nevertheless Samaras communication does not clear the doubts about its bearing: "We have would obligate us to the support of the transition government, but otherwise to nothing".
The conservative leader went a step too far with its challenge of the EU and the IMF, that organism, that that 8000 million that Athens must urgently necessarily, entsperren. It placed clearly that it would approve of no declaration of obligations over the fulfillment of the savings measures.
But the European commission, that yet always is irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, strengthened yesterday again, at its demand is not to be shake: The economy aid would not sign if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties became not as soon as possible" sign "an agreement of unambiguous written.
The speaker of the Department of Commerce, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika would return to Athens "very soon" in order to discuss with the new government, "what kind of payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8000 million Euro "necessary would be" although there is yet no final date.
The Greek Kn√§uel still has threads for a while.
