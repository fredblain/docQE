Terrorist front understands itself, of which Sahara until to Nigeria
Paris is disturbed over the relations between al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The already long relations standing under suspicion between the terrorist group al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday the Algerian Abdelkader Messahel itself had confirmed that Algier would have now about that" certainty attained".
"The type and manner, with that both organizations advance as well as the relations of the secret services point at a clear collaboration there" to go declared it without further into the detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The ascertainments over the kidnapping taken place in the last January of these Frenchmen in the Niger days had promoted interfaces too.
The Antoine kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers the Aqmi de Léocour and Vincent Delory should have been killed at the subsequent day to the same time such as several of its abductors on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators claim to have found several telephone chips in the ruins at the use place, that belonged to the terrorist.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the led phone calls leads to several interlocutors, who are stationed in Mali, in the Niger as well as in Nigeria.
According to radio France international (RFI) the investigators interest especially the numbers of these interlocutors: A number leads himself to a Nigerian, who long time in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, that cradle of Boko Haram had delayed; the other leads to a man, who counts as the Aqmi and the sect nearly standing.
"This is a progress, one must await however doubtless more unambiguous records before one can" speak about a strategic collaboration between Aqmi and Boko harem.
"It is to be sure conceivable".
"One knows since years, that the sect financial and intellectual support of relates and that this itself increasingly actively shows", softens the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo off.
In these last months, these had become more and more" support achievements" in its course obviouser, carry just as the talks as well as the operation modes of Boko harem, that point out now the consulting of suicide attempts as well as the use of explosive materials more complexly becoming always, that the same handwriting like that, that were used by Aqmi.
The international partnership in order to begin in Washington, exerted since this moment pressure on Abuja so that one takes into account there for the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have the grouping in the deed long time over as a partnership of Illuminaten considered, that no special attention would have to be given.
Fast success
That in 2002 in Maiduguri in environment of a mosque, a school as well as the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf established Boko Haram - what in Haoussa so much meant like" the western upbringing is a shame" - pursues the erection of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the amalgamation learns rapid successes.
It politicizes herself and claims strict compliance of the shariah while that intervene its activists incorporated in the battle against the godless central government.
The activists have first of all churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
2009 the activists of Boko Haram with its reinforced attacks against the commissioner's offices appeared especially on.
The reaction on the part of Abuja is however usual like indifferenziert.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
The Mohammed Yusuf taken in captivity is killed in the prison.
As a result the sect becomes visibly more radically and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas acknowledged it an attempt in Jos, that 80 human lives demanded, then to a further in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram is shown the guilt of a suicide attempt, happened that in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its type.
In August the local seat of the United Nations to the priority international target runs.
The development of a terrorist axis in Africa, that should lead of Mauretanien over Nigeria until there to Somalia, disturbs since then all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Nigers occupied, that Somalis of al Shabaab in Kenya operate, Boko harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week hatta Alain Juppé on the occasion of a conversation with Präsident Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko harem warned and appeared ready" to announce all references".
