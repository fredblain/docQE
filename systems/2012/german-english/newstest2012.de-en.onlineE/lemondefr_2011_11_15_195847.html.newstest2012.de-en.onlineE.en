What does the fraud represent in offensive messages?
After the family aids, UMP and government take now the offensive messages in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy will become on Tuesday, that 15th of Novembers in Bordeaux arrive, in order to search for a family aid cash register and to propose a speech over that - already since 2007 always recurring - subject of the battle against social fraud as well as economic dependence of the country.
In order to accompany this attack, that comes from the endeavoring to subject the economy in a hardness sample, on which other side represents however not more little precursor of an axis of the right presidency campaign, the majority wants to concentrate on employee offensive messages.
First of all with household economic goal: the government the introduction of a fourth Karenztages envisages before consideration of an offensive message with employees in the private sector.
On well German this means that a sick employee would lose the wage without permission of the specific firm of four days, therefore therefore at least 15% of its monthly income.
To conjure up one that according to the daily newspaper" harvest echoes" wrath threatens help would become, however in addition to bring in 280 million Euro.
And that with another rather symbolic character along would go: to clear the country official an unvergüteten Karenztag in the illness trap (until now gives it for it, in contrast to the three Karenztagen in the private sector, NO Karenzfrist at all).
In the meantime these questions in the discussion stand, kindles the majority also of new the Betrugsthematik whereby this time on the abuse connected with Arbeitsabsenz aimed becomes.
"Inspections substantially will be more important, and in addition are this to refund, if this demanded becomes", warned Xavier pray edge on Sunday, the 13th of November before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
How also in other cases the effects of this message seem with respect to reality of deceitful actions in the area of the offensive messages a little unproportioniert.
This is in the deed already since 2002 objects of permanent observation as well as more political offensives, that carried most frequently fruits.
The Frenchmen are no longer more frequent sick as people other plotted in Europe.
Let's linger however first of all in the nationwide figures.
Loud the country health insurance company CNAM more were paid in 2006 than 237 million Euro day settlements.
The day settlements in 2008 with 11.3 billion represented the economic research institute and documentation institute of public health Euro of 5% the medical expenses.
Under this sum, 46% regarding motherhood vacation as well as work accidents and 54% concerning sick leave, that 6.2 billions of Euro fell.
And accordingly 2.5% medical expense.
In 2010, on the average only 14.5 sick days were accrued the Frenchman vis-à-vis the 17.8 days per years 2009 according to a study of the Alma Consulting group.
An average that glosses over certain differences: another, in 2007 of monster. com, website for career planning, publishes became, showed up that 75% of the 40th 000 questioned to have taken French employee indicated, no single sick day.
Another study grasped this time by the health insurance places clearly that 37% of the offensive messages in 2010 of shorter duration were than a 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and and 11% about that to three months.
Compared to tend its European neighbor the French employees therefore no longer as elsewhere to disability.
One in long-term study led 2010 by two researchers the French, national center for science research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global Absenzquote (illnesses or other established) oscillated, and to be sure in France between 10% and 11% contrary to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the united kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in offensive messages represents a disappearing slight share with respect to the illicit work.
Regarding the fraud, only a weak is reached here.
The confirmation of the legislation since 2002 has entailed that there are systmatische inspections in offensive messages, that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for education and continued education of technicians and engineers) assessed under 1.5 million inspections that 13% of that 285,000 of the realized, short-term offensive messages that were in 37,050 cases", unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled offensive message cases of more than 45 days duration one counted under 1.2 million 11% at" maladjusted or unjustified" cases, that 132,000.
Altogether this makes therefore 169.000"ungerechtfertigte" cases on several millions employee who made an offensive message validly.
A figure that represents only a weak vis-à-vis for example that one the illicit work.
According to the UMP delegate Dominique Tian, author of a special report appeared in July with respect to this question, represents this between 9 and 15 billion Euro tax profit loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost at day compensation, and therefore substantially more than the Defraudation in last-named.
