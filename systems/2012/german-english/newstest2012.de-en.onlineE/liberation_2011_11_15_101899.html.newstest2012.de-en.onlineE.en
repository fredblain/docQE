Is immigration load or chance for the economy?
The immigration politics led under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized out of angles multifarious - overload by police organs, court organs and administration organs based on a politics subjected to the numbers, compatibility of this politics with the status one "country of the human rights" how France itself had entitled itself.
Recently the annoyance arranged against foreign students by official side had stamped the newsreel, had announced the Secretary of the Interior incidentally (see Libération of the 23rd of May), compel would have that France" no talents, mason or waiter out of foreign countries".
But this politics became only rarely of the economical viewpoint out of analyzed.
Over this subject, a long-range consent between rights and left rules namely.
Of right side, the tone was struck of Jacques Chirac, represent might that 1976 had explained, that" the 900,000 unemployed, under that over 2 million immigrated labor forces, no problem for a country", by left side by Michel Rocard, that 1990 had represented, France" the entire poverty of the world could not receive".
Only difference exists in the degree of that
The fear of the invasion of the national ground through hordes of Polish plumber was divided in 2005 both of to the right and of to the left.
Of both warehouses, the immigrants were perceived as a load for the economy and the French company.
The single difference exists to admit is in that just that that one vis-à-vis the immigrants willing.
Francois get countries is restricted would permit in its program to banality, that refer on that, based on partnership development it to solve our" migration problems".
This presentation of immigration as a load when problem, can affect possibly the choices; however is it economically costly.
How the economy experts imagine us Ian gold and Geoffrey Cameron in a work appeared recently, that the newest insights regarding the immigration summarizes (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our world and wants Define Our future, May 2011, Princeton University of press, 352 S.), existed under the specialist a wide consent with respect to the positive influence of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
To restrict the immigration the growth would weaken and would damage the labor market situation.
The fears vis-à-vis the influence of the migrants are based on the presentation that these threaten to replace the domestic labor forces, especially that more slightly qualified, in that they exerted pressure on its wages.
The experience shows however that the immigrants in truth are substantially more complementary than as the domestic laborers, because they exercise occupations in sectors, that are job technical not at full capacity.
The slightly qualified immigrants work work in sectors, that domestic laborers excite few, the more qualified under the immigrants in dynamic sectors, in which the education is not adjusted the work offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as as a surgeon difficulties have would become to work in a country, in which a lack rules of anesthesiologists, this complementarity causes also a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs between domestic and migrant on wages and domestic labor market situation.
Giovanni Peri calculated on this type and manner that a 1 %- iger climb of the immigrant flood would induce a with included, long-term increase of the real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without consideration of the fact that the variety brought in by the immigrants of the idea creation as well as the economic growth is beneficial (high share of naturalized immigrants under American noble prize winner; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBAY and Yahoo became of immigrants established).
The migrants contribute also net to the social systems, in the European countries on average about in a height of 1% of the entire household.
The world work organization appreciates for example that a person immigrating at the age of 30 years to Germany brings in the public household in the average over its lifetime a net contribution (revenue minus editions) by about 150,000 Euro.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to induce the missing intersections to start of its mandate" with the teeth".
These purported teeth that the immigrants should deter obtained however exactly the contrary effect.
