Development of the trip prices since 1989
Until 1989, it gave in the travel agency at that time only five allowed national: Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of sold at that time above all solely trips into the socialistic Eastern bloc countries, into the west might at that time only selected.
And so Czech tourists traveled at the Baltic Sea (into the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), into the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the peninsula rummaged at the black sea), to Bulgaria and Rumania at the black sea and to Hungary at the Balaton.
A light exception was the period of 1962 to 1972 when one was allowed to travel also to Yugoslavia, hit Yugoslavia a per western course and therefore the trips strongly were restricted to Yugoslavia.
A large paradoxically those socialistic times it was that it was not permitted once citizens of the Eastern bloc (therefore also the Tschechoslowaken) to travel in the frame of the socialistic countries freely.
If a citizen of that wanted to travel for example individually to Poland or quite into the Soviet Union, he did not need were in addition a so-called invitation letter, otherwise Individualreisen possible.
Already at that time the travel agencies also trips offered into the west, had to take one however gigantic snakes in purchase or spend the night also in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, and/or at least "good acquaintance" in the travel agency have.
Also so the thing had not run yet long.
That so-called. Foreign currency promise - the condition for a departure into the west - was given only "politically dependable" people - the other were allowed to travel not at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was would have been impossible namely no free exchange cash currency, without foreign currency promise it therefore to find the necessary finance means (western currency) for a trip into the west.
The from afar most Czechs of spent therefore its vacation in the inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought themselves chateaus innumerable and Datschen - a habit that lasts until today.
A trip revolution of the Czechs followed the samtenen revolution of 1989 on the foot.
While until 1989 a vacation in the GDR or in Bulgaria were the measure of all things, the Czechs in the past year 4.5 million of its foreign vacation spent into countries of the entire world.
A powerful paradoxically, whose one is aware himself today not at all more, the fact is that one was not able to travel into the presently most popular vacation country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the at that time Yugoslavia.
Same of the start of the '90's of the past century at the foreign currency duty was canceled into the neighboring west european countries, what evoked a powerful wave of short visit above all to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken were not able to get long time of its trips into the west simply enough, everyone wanted to have been at least a couple of day there.
So the Czech vacationers slept in trips to Paris in the tent in the park, for who would have had at that time already the money for a lodging in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature in trips abroad of Czechs was at that time a with canned food, beer and hard sausage etc. of full thrilling trunk.
A further important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchange cash Czech crown - after decades finally freely were able to shop itself our tourists the western currency.
Our life level and hereby also the average salaries increased, what flowed 1997 into a further important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands after trips, the travel agencies began to prepare trips after 1997 regularly through charter flights by what means the flight trips to negotiate thanks to the possibility, bulk discounts, in comparison with the past incredibly reduced in price.
The Czechs had end of the '90's, with exception of the USA, already foreigncurrencyless payment traffic with all advanced countries of the world, what made the traveling even simpler.
To a further interesting moment in the story of the "postal service samtenen of" holiday traffic it came in 2000 when thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight was dispatched into an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then annually direct charters airplanes with Czech passengers in far fly removed sunny countries; this year one flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations on.
At the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually into exotic countries!
A further important moment in the epoch, that our "postal service marked revolutionary" development, came in the year 2008.
On the 17th of November 2008, the visa duty canceled the USA for Czech tourists by what means our country joined definitively under the advanced countries of the world.
In 2008 spent the Czechs for the first time more than the half of its vacation abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in its story they gave inclusive of the costs for a single vacation stay at the vacation place more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head from.
