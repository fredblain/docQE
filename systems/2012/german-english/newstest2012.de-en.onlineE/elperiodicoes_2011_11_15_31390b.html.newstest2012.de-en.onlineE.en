Park or mountain?
The architects are seen of the quarrellings over the honorariums with the announcement agreed.
The municipal announcement over the 16 gates opens the debate over the significance of Collserola in Barcelona on the new.
Middle of the '1980's, to the highpoint of the Corporación Metropolitana disappeared in the meantime de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration its lampoon over the support by Collserola.
The pamphlet described the mountain as a gigantic park in Barcelona city.
It was compared even in numbers to the Central park of New York.
With the downfall of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many became again the upper limit of Barcelona, for the capital Kataloniens belongs to the few, that does not spread out in north-south-direction, but rather towards the top (mountains) and below (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a nature reserve plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central park served now no longer, but rather Yellowstone with wild pigs in the roll of the Yogibärs.
One was so far when the city issued in September a giant announcement, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates after Collserola.
Undoubtedly a gate refers to the draft of a park.
That either is so, or someone intends to place gates on the country.
The question stands of even: Collserola, park or mountain?
The announcement is not only from organisational point of view, but rather also with regard to a reflection over the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a rekurrentes subject, on which two members of this old resident box can fall back, who meet in the procession.
And exactly this fact offers the material for one of the rare agreements between that, what three architects think from Barcelona about that, and to some university professors who applied themselves on the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The announcement is appropriate.
For Roldán "is it necessary" to speak after the attack on the coast over the "front at the mountains" as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, that was not expedited over the green apples.
"One should come from the principle that Barcelonas is largest park the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex", judges the architect, for which the title of "gates of Collserola" rescues a "lexical trap" in itself: One may not imagine it "as accesses to a park, but rather as a containment of zones, on which acted will must".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with city structural experience, regards the suggestion as one "intellectual challenge" that rescues "some dangers" in itself.
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty, that the formation of a public room nowadays with itself brings" after the experiences out of the '1980's that had its "swan in the area of the forum song".
The first fear is the own containment on that, what may be cultivated.
"Something to limit meant always, the next step to determine" to exceed i.e. it.
"One must think about new city structural planning instruments, for the present [reference taking on the plan general Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead" to a real catastrophe.
Modol, that complies narrower with the question, does not mean simplified, the side of Collserola that goes toward Vallesana, "can than a park understood become, that in direction Barcelona", and to be sure out of purely topografischen reasons.
Modol does not remember that it gives already a study of the patronage de Collserola, that "on deaf ears knock should" although it gratefully would be to the city administration, that it gave its group the possibility to assist with this project "of the first moment at".
Moreover he notices in that the vicinity of the mountains to the city is the escort letter, that enables it the architect to participate in the debate although he expresses its "doubts" on that, whether this technical profile the established multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the correct", says he) guide should "we architects should only a tool be".
Bayona indicates that the answer would be complex to the question in the heading of this article, there in the announcement conditions a global visibility of Collserola false: "It became 16 competitions in the cross-section written out", says it, "on the axis mountains sea. But there is observes no along cut perspective, that the zone in its entirety".
That led at least in its case in addition that it participates in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise the program and the definition of a project would collide for a gate with that of the architect of the gate beside it.
According to its opinion the city unconditionally should guarantee that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length so, that a soft transition between city and green zones emerges.
