Intelligent crows spread out in cities
In many places sowing crows count as a "problem birds" : Yet out of the cities, the highly intelligent animals can be banished by far more, maintain experts.
The one like would like to get rid of it, that others it very quickly: Crows have belonged for centuries to the cityscape, but in many communities, resident troubles heap themselves over dirt and noise of the animals.
At the same time a means against the "problem is birds" not yet in visibility.
Sowing crows would be to gotten out of the cities no longer, said experts in the first crow symposium in the east Frisian Leer.
There specialists prepared out of the entire federal territory over possible exits.
They seek alternative in the cities
Conservationists attributed at the same time the problems in cities also to the country flight of the especially protected sowing crows: The chemistry use in the agriculture destroys increasingly the traditional habitats.
The hunt, increasing development and that cases of typical brood trees made the birds life heavily.
Crows stand under environmental protection.
There are sowed large colonies with more than 600 brood couples among other things in the westphalian, in the northwest among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen as well as in Leer.
There a disputed project to the abundant killing of crows in the district had provided 2005 for negative headline.
Critics had the catching of the animals in Vogelfallen and the killing with club as especially brutal designated.
"The normal expulsion, the frightening away, brings nothing", assessed the city plans and landscape plans Werner Klöver out of Leer.
Way inject nest with water or said trees fällen, would have often undesirable consequences, also the environment experts Manfred emperor out of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals of soft from, large colonies split itself and distribute itself at other places".
Let Vergrämung be only as an exception at hospitals, age homes or schools conceivably.
"We must live with them, we get it no longer away".
Without the surrounding countryside, the problem in the cities could not be solved, meant mayor Wolfgang waiter out of Leer.
Let a combination be conceivable out of frightening away of the animals out of sensitive living areas and curl offer in order to establish it at other places again.
"Information chalkboards instead of chain saws" the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta OF Maria Jürgen advertised on the other hand for a completely other contact with the animals: We can bear" "a pimple in the face in the end best self-confident.
Jürgen had established with the Ascheberger crow scholar path in Schleswig-Holstein, at which reference signs inform about life of the highly intelligent sowing crows.
The project would be supposed in the meantime already of tourist.
Also to the criticism of the noise of the birds, an own opinion had Jürgen: "There a lot of communication, that is have itself much to say".
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Sowing crows use not only remedy in order to come at a delicacy, but rather place its tool as a remedy even even here.
Behavior researchers of the university Cambridge tested recently at four sowing crows how far the intelligence of the birds passes.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they must bring a scaffolding with stones to the collapse in order to arrive so at a moth larva.
Without much training of recognized it purposeful, which size and form must have a stone, in order let collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the smart crows had to solve then a kniffligeres problem.
In a vertically set up cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds were not able to reach its prey.
To be sure the researchers had left them wire pieces.
From that all four animals formed a hook, with whose aid it then the bucket at the handle out of the tube of fished.
This succeeded three of the four sowing crows even on attempt.
