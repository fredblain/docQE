Mass slaughter on a personal level 
Einfühlsam and generous begins Peter Englunds new book, "beauty and horror: a History of the First World War, told in nineteen Schicksalen" with a long list of protagonists to heart. 
Here is a tip, as you could do: cut off the side of caution and make it to your readers. 
They are the people in Englunds romanhafter narrative know each other very well, and these protagonists as your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments, in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and are deprived of their illusions. 
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist. 
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature. 
He has written an unusual book that he was not incorrect as "a work of history." 
It contains only a few big names and big contracts or famous battles, and there are hardly any ambassadors, reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment. 
It is not so much a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." it is of "feelings, ideas, experiences and sentiments." 
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less concealed men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, drivers and office workers. 
Some of these people are heroes. 
Some prisoners of war, lose limb will be crazy or die. 
Each of these lives flackert such as the Votivkerzen in a church, some, while others lapse. 
Englunds book differs from the usual history books. 
It also corrected the notion that the First World War had just been the devastating war on the West Front. 
"Beauty and horror" with experts on other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa. 
The soldiers are covered in this book baskets' celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen is an insoluble problem. 
This is almost from the beginning of a very moving book. 
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, which smells like Kordit. 
Imagine that you are a woman who is home with their children, and cannon fire is heard in the distance, and I urge you, or you take the flight? 
Who is at all? 
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all. 
"There is a lack of facts," Englund says so, "guesswork, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories abound, dreams, aufgemöbelt Alpträumen and rumour." 
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard, a young German matrosen. 
Their stories were mainly memoirs, letters and other already published material. 
Your reports can be frightening or poignant, but they are very vivid in Englunds the details of verliere nden collection of small moments. 
Many of them act of omission and Behelfen. 
The story of a German schoolgirls told him: "Substitute, everywhere." 
"Kaffee, false aluminium, false gummi extremist groups, wooden buttons." 
He tells us more about the dinner in Germany. 
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and Hammelfett (and most recently was served with a false bones from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes, which were besohlt with wood." 
There was, as he noted, "837 registered substitute foods that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee." 
Some stories act of honor and bravery. 
An American acknowledges his own drive for ferocity and says about the war: "We feel that this is, after all, what was planned for men rather than to sit on the Lehnstuhl, with the evening newspaper or the bestselling book and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so, as a façade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and besch were brust hemd." 
Conversely, a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and no one notice or will look into this. 
"If the idea to sacrifice themselves, we would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes. 
Instead, it is so terrible as "a condemned man, who was hanged in secret." 
Other observations from the old Europe, which falls apart, and on new types of terror. 
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories." 
He starts the arrival of what he called "a new species in the Bestiarium of the new century," says: "The word and ideologically convinced mass murderer in the suit, the poor, while he sits behind a desk." 
People behave in unexpected ways, and there are also appears behaviour such as Heroismus. 
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute being infected with a venereal disease, in order to escape the frontline service. 
"The grotesque expression of what can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals, in the hope to come to the hospital," he writes. 
"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eyes, which meant that the rest of their lives were blind." 
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is sleek, but decent and fits perfectly with its human task. 
In dozens of small scenes he starts the way, as the war "in a unique way, entfesselte uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred." 
The people are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders fighting them. 
The best books on the First World War were often more distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Gallery Memory" or Romane such as Erich Maria Remarques "is nothing new in the West" as a comprehensive history books. 
Englunds band is an unconventional black hall. 
His book is the most devastating of which I have ever read in a book. 
I admit that there is no longer. 
But it is, as he would have us with his book this side with the protagonists in the faces of weggeschnappt and lit with a match.
