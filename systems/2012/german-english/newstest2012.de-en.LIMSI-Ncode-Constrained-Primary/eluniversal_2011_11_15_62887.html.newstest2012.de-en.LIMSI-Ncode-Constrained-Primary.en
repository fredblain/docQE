MSS has announced a research protocol to the discovery of the gene for obesity 
Mexico's Social Security Institution is leading a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and adolescents, which will be supported by specialists of the IPN. 
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Institution of Mexico) announced that a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found. 
Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, focus on biochemistry) at the clinic, Hospital de Especialidades del Centro regions Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, pflegern health, nutrition specialists and social workers has been built. 
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Italian de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). 
The public is invited to take part in the study, interested parties will be able to IMSS sports venues in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8am tests will be carried out with children and adolescents. 
He stressed that the investigation on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) and began since the 8th October at the sports venue of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the federal state México) will continue. 
If the goal of 500 to 600 individuals is achieved, the study on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the main urban bezirks) continued and Morelos (in the north of the main urban bezirks) concluded. 
He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. 
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said it would seek three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires. 
They are also questions about their physical activity and their family vorgeschichte disease risk factors, diabetes or kidney failure could have meant to control. 
He also led to the aforementioned Samstags investigative subjects measured (weight, size, taille size), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as the glukose level, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt the identification of genes associated with obesity in childhood). 
Cruz Lopez stressed that the investigation would take advantage of the health workers concerned about the alarming weight of young people. 
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in less than six years the percentage of obese boys to 77 per cent and the girls with obesity had increased by 47%, while obesity has risen dramatically," emphasized the specialist of the IMSS. 
He admitted that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population of the differences in other nations. 
He admitted that a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65% in the average indianisch American, to 30 per cent of European and African descent to 5 per cent, which is in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity, reflects. 
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity, the inability of the surplus of energy (calories) burned, so this will be stored in a form of fat. 
The researchers said that the direct benefit to the research participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity. 
It would even the appearance of different skin faltes in the neck and on the Innenarm (Akanthosis) on the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage. 
All the information would be kept confidential and the parents notified in writing by the doctors, but the doctors tell the parents all measurements and propose changes to the lifestyle, which are appropriate for the prevention of diseases. 
Cruz Lopez said that there would be three basic factors for excess weight, obesity and other chronic diseases are responsible: physical inactivity, which means a lack of movement on a daily basis, the most time of the day to spend before the television and use of transport to go on foot rather than short routes. 
The high caloric intake, which means an increased consumption of gezuckert beverages and Kohlenhydraten (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high fat and protein, as well as genetics, which is to be analysed in this research project.
