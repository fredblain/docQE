The world according to the Republican presidential candidate 
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, disturbed by simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, as well as the provision of aid to Israel. 
Can a krisengeschwächtes America is a complex world with simple, not to say: stupid ideas? 
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate, the voters could almost get that impression. 
Over the past few days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and their supporters in their thundering declarations and statements on foreign policy, traditionally Republican priorities, said repeatedly. 
China, Iran and the Israeli aid - often backed up in any way - slogans. 
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the top of the course Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and the "currency manipulation" - the leading issue in an America that the migration of industries to Asia strongly prefer not to blame. 
Stupid, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said. 
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China, under Obama, and the only candidate to have a mature vision of foreign policy, it seems the emotions almost about his schmeichelnden behavior strangled. 
He had a firm, but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current stance of the Obama). 
But Huntsman will not be heard, because he is stagnating in the depths of public opinion polls. 
Reagan 
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to talking about halting the nuclear programme. 
"If I am elected, I zones in Iran," he was on hearing. 
"If Obama is re-elected, they will get the bomb." 
In addition, Israel has stepped up military aid promised and Obama accused his partners on commitments to be guilty. 
The businessman Herman Cain, the second most plazierter candidate, in turn, has a shameful unkenntnis display. 
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat against him, because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to be the fact that China has already been in place since 1964 in possession of military nuclear weapons. 
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, backed by Israel and calls for military action against Iran, for its part, is to be prepared to do so, the American army in Mexico to combat drug cartels in service. 
The Obama 2009 prohibits the use of torture against suspected terrorists was also of Cain, Perry, as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann advocates. 
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight. 
The current kontrahenten president, Reagan also had simple ideas, and despite all that won the Cold War. 
They recall that Obama is an amateur and had to pay water in his wine, which was the subject anti-terrorist. 
You rightly insist on the failure of his naive Zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which he also has the reputation of the weakness. 
However, this Anfeindung is not quite so straightforward. 
The population is more positive assessment of the national security under Obama, Bin Laden has switched off. 
Since Iraq they asserted against military intervention, which lead to clog up. 
And Obama surprised more by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt in order to give its leadership to new life.
