The CDU proposes that the EU president to be elected by general vote 
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November was in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, with no real problems. 
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but has prevailed in the autumn, especially for those activists to make government policy regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax. 
The resolution proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously. 
1001 delegates had only nine voted against, 10 abstained. 
The several minutes of standing ovation on the basis of which Interventionserlässen at first, Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, were left by the three European zugeneigten Finance Minister no doubt open. 
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the Antrage - the following slogan: "The response to the crisis is" not less but more Europe ." 
It is not simply because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro." 
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe." 
This could be the control of the European Union, reinforcing the overhaul of the Lisbon Treaty on the budget policies of the countries in the euro zone, as well as it could, however, in the election of the President of the European Commission based on universal vote result "in order to give Europe a face." 
But in any case, this is one of the proposals approved by Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. 
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: big britannien is opposed to the cause, and the flagship of the CDU think to know that Nicolas Sarkozy, of the same opinion. 
But the milestone has been laid. 
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority the proposal of the weighting of each country according to the Executive Board rejected the weighting of the individual economies, which is obviously a strong position in Germany. 
The calming effect on the climate within their party considered Chancellor has therefore references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl stepped up, but it has not tried to Congress on costs of the "small" or the European countries are in difficulty to win immediately criticize the arrogant Germany. 
As far as the resolution of the importance of the "Franco-German friendship" devoted a paragraph calling on Angela Merkel, France is not on the plan. 
At least not directly. 
Because it reminds us that Leipzig two centuries ago was at the centre of a bloody battle. 
In fact one of the zuhöchst the humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army.
