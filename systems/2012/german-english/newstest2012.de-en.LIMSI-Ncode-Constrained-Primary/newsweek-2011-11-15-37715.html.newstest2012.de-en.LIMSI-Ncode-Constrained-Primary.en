The military is growing pressure to crack down on rape 
This week, an important hearing is to decide whether 28 women and men for failing to intervene in a rape to be charged before the military court. 
If it does not happen, there are hundreds of prosecutor ready for the next hearing. 
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a colleague. 
It was in October 2008, and she has just returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from the dinner with a friend when she met with a male colleague, a 12er pile of beer. 
He asked them whether they should accompany a drink in her room. 
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said. 
But the Texanerin wischte put aside their concerns. 
I thought: ' Oh, what he is 19. 
He is from Texas," she said. 
"I wish I would have listened to my gut feeling." 
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans room, the man behind her, put her down and raped her, she said. 
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials fearful of a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a complaint against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court. 
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers are tackled. 
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, DC, the complaint was initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but in the next few months rose to 28:25 women and three men, who all claim that they are soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, convict or a proper administration of justice after the alleged attack to make them available. 
Burke says she has the top military leadership, because the problem begins there. 
"The military is hierarchical," she says. 
"Who are the individuals who are in the position, the culture of retribution to eradicate the leadership." 
Burke also says that since February nearly 400 other survivors contacted, many of them part of future complaints could be. 
Their strategy: instead that all claimants will lay their eggs in one basket, if necessary, they file many more lawsuits, in order to maintain the pressure. 
The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject a complaint. 
The files of the court, the week before, detailed defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military is not current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for violations, which occurred in the armed forces. 
On the basis of a law by the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres-Doktrin, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active service soldiers. 
"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiff," the document says. 
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story. 
Things have changed since the 1950s. 
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction lies in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts. 
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with indigenous women in the war zones. 
The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in hostilities. 
It is time that the armed forces will be modernised, says Burke. 
And it is in their fight not alone: three other lawsuits are pending. 
At the Yale Law School, is the veteran ' Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere. 
Collects small independent non-profit Vietnam veteran of America's a complaint against the military, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," which received rape victims to dismiss them out of the service - a standard approach, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group. 
In December the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration (management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who have been sexually abused at the service. 
Nine laws have been independent of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties presented to the Congress, which will provide a series of clues. 
In 2010, according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Office for preventing and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defense reported 3 158 sexual abuse. 
But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and after the Pentagon's own estimate takes into account the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19 000 cases per year. 
The report, which was published in March, also examines the legal trends: in 2010, 20% of registered cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law. 
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma. 
In Lymans case, they reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack. 
On this night, she says, she was asked 11 times, the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and Befehlshabern to tell. 
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed. 
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex she had the assault with her friend. 
Six people said as a character in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted. 
"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman says. 
"I thought the labor would use. I ran screaming from the courtroom." 
"They brought me into the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander: this was not his trial, and that was my trial." 
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiater, in the end, a diagnostizierte personality disorder and declared them incompetent. 
In January 2010, she was sacked dishonourable, so that it receives no support. 
Whether or not the complaint, the Lyman and the other claimants have submitted is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of jurisprudence at the George Washington University Law School. 
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward." 
As far as between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since, for the first time it has been called into question. 
I am a critic of the Feres-Doktrin. 
The military lags a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, which entails a liability. 
He adds: "The odds are against them... but it is important for them that they are trying to do." 
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight. 
If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with their hundreds of other plaintiffs start for future cases. 
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says. 
Or until we die, whatever happens as the first.
