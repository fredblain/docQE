Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas in Europe 
The gas pipeline Nord Stream, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe directly links with Russia, has been put into operation. 
It is gas for the equivalent of 30 million households. 
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and ceremony. 
More than 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast of Orchesterbeschallung and feinschmecker buffet attended the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream, Russia and Germany under the sea links directly with each other. 
The German Chancellor, Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolic joint turned the steering wheel of the channel, which the Russian gas transported into the Western European network. 
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a pipeline from 1 224 kilometers in length, the region St. Petersburg links with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, will be delivered to Western Europe. 
A second pipeline, which has a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012. 
And it is already the possibility of the construction of a third route. 
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this vast edifice as a victory. 
The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed. 
The Nord Stream pipeline will provide a direct gas to Germany, avoiding any Trassenverlaufs with third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the land. 
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of its power: it is now more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to Western European markets. 
Warsaw, most closely involved in the debate, has not shied away from the North Stream pipeline with a "new deutsch-sowietischen pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939. 
This means that the issue is politically very sensitive. 
Western Europe has the backing of the Russian project won an even greater energy security. 
This, however, cost of starvation of European energy, because the project has caused a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans. 
Russia has managed in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong Gasverbrauche and whose gas reserves are becoming exhausted. 
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us together in organic way," said François Fillon at the opening of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the big Gasverträge are also important for political and economic side. 
All of this explains the broad smile of the Lubmin many represented Gazprom managers in terms of Gaszuleitung. 
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a prominent technology. 
The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete casing, which is intended to protect them from ships berth. 
It rests on the seabed around 200 metres deep. 
Its construction had evaded previous minefields from the Second World War. 
"Some hundreds of mines have had to be removed or destroyed for safety's sake," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream. 
We also had to step up measures taken to protect the fauna and flora. 
The leadership is a long queue of metal, hard as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither outlets or maintenance stations. 
A monitoring platform was laid off the coast of Sweden, but the project developers have backed away from it, as the Swedes were not eager to a Russian civil society in a permanent way to settle their coasts. 
"In the event of an accident, we are Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," Mr. Müller clarified. 
In the case of a leak, the hole in the gas pipeline gas in the air. 
This case comes from the designers, however, seen as unlikely as the approaches to the consistency of a leak was estimated per 100 000 years. 
The state control of the gas pipeline will be both guaranteed by a Unterwasser-Roboter of external purposes is controlled by a Seeschiff, as well as by a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline. 
It has the form of a cigar, attaches a metre in diameter, will be introduced into the interior of the pipeline and might move. 
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of three meters per second, provides the device in his arrival the most accurate information about possible Deformations of the metal. 
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years, without even the slightest repair. 
The Gaszirkulation is quite simply guaranteed by pressure. 
This is more than 200 cash for access to 100 cash at the exit point. 
Five companies have combined their efforts to implement this project. 
The administration, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares. 
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF affiliated (15,5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez (9%). 
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which is charged with the construction and operation of the pipeline. 
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax system is particularly favourable. 
Gazprom then this society has rented the entire capacity of its Gastransportes and renewable 20 year contract. 
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how large the real volume may be transported," clarified Mr. Müller. 
The financing of the baus gas pipeline was 30% of shareholders, as well as 70% backed by bank loans. 
The total labour costs should be 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines. 
For GDF Suez, the total investment, for example, 240 million. 
However, the minority shareholders are likely to recoup their expenses, since Gazprom alone bears the liability risk. 
The gas pipeline is a gritty, Kiefers forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea. 
The 4.5 metres high values are the Gasaustrittspforte. 
Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the arriving gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines. 
Since last Tuesday, this terminal with one million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per hour. 
This would be in full capacity of 3 million cubic metres per hour, as well as 6 million in 2012.
