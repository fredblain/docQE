The threat is real 
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media cast doubt on the German rule of law. 
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which is now auflebe again. 
The murders of eight Turkish and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background. 
This news will be in Turkey and the Turkish people in Germany reacted with fear and concern. 
For many Turks, returns with a long totgeglaubt ghost: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with right-wing extremist background against Turks. 
The fact that in Germany, there is xenophobia, however, was never in question. 
The right-wing extremist network, however, reveals proportions, whose dimension is still far from predictable. 
"Is back on the bloody ideology?," the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "turk." 
The newspaper 'Sabah', however, stressed that one of the perpetrators has been a V-Mann of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities might be involved in the far-right quagmire. 
Besonnen responded to the Turkish community in Germany: they remembered at the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence. 
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish leaders in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish anwerbe agreement. 
The cooperation was orchestrated in gaudy colours - as a history of success. 
As a slap in the face, because the reporting by some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the umpteenth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which cites the background of the murder. 
The German version of the 'Hürriyet' it is not thought to be linked. 
"It starts to stink," reads the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci. 
He stressed that people had been killed, the taxes paid and their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had done. 
It will be extremely critical in Germany's Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their discussion later success. 
Why the German authorities have not been invaded much more in extremist right-wing circles to search for suspects, the authors were surprised. 
Some shows at least rhetorically committed to drastic measures: "Will continue to be done carelessly, the migrants do nothing other than the defense and the armed forces." 
"This will probably be the best protection." 
"From the goodness of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium." 
What does it mean if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks demonstrated by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s. 
The photograph of the ruine fire of Solingen is deeply embedded in German and Turkish memory. 
Because no other event showed the Turks more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence. 
However, the attacks schärften the sense on the Turkish side. 
The mistakes of the past are not repeated 
In the Turkish press was particularly criticized the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl, refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. 
After the arson attack in Solingen he sent a message of condolences to the Turkish President, at the funeral in Cologne but represented by his Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel was then in his speech on how many charges was provided by the local Turks. 
Quite so, as berechne the value of a human being, according to the size of its tax revenues. 
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again how deep the distrust of many türkes since then in the abandonment of the rule of law. 
In addition to the efforts of an extensive investigation and reassessment of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs frank words.
