Boeing has a record of 18 trillion dollars in country 
Airline Emirates ordered 50 gängige aircraft from the Boeing 777 with an option for 20 more aircraft. 
In addition, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a deal worth more than 1 trillion dollars. 
It is really a rare news that a company gets about 50 pieces of its products. 
But it is a big business, if the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the list price for these 50 aircraft as a whole with a record total of 18 trillion dollars. 
It is also unusual for the client of Boeing, the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders. 
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East in the next 20 years 2 520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars are needed. 
Boeing announced at the weekend its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 gängige Boeing 777 Jets. 
The request came from the airline Emirates from Dubai. 
The airline also has Boeing announced 2011 at the Dubai Air Show, an option on the purchase of 20 more planes, the total list price of 26 trillion dollars. 
On Monday, then did, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, fuel consumption and the comfort of passengers vastly improved. 
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars. 
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, expert of morning star. 
"The quality of these special customers is very high." 
Many airlines in the Middle East are in possession of the oil producing countries. 
So they have not only the money to pay for the planes, but rather is a rise in oil prices, which usually hurts the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so damaging, because the country is at a higher price. 
This is important, because they are less than other airlines tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, when oil prices rise, Dihora said. 
"You have a natural hedge," he said. 
The appointment of Sultanate reinforces Boeing's leading position in the market for large aircraft and helps the Airbus competitors SAS to keep in check the supremacy of the A350. 
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus has announced that it would postpone the launch of the biggest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER. 
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence, after customers asked for a higher burden and scope. 
Boeing shares rose by 1,5% to 67.94.
