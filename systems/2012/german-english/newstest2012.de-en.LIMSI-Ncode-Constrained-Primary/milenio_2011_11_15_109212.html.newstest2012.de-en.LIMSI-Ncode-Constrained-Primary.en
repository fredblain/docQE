The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic bruchs. 
A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday appointed Monti on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, would meet to confirm the government building. 
It is expected that a majority of the cabinet made up of technocrats, although it is still not clear when the new prime minister will take up his post. 
Monti said he would give the president the results of the talks with the political parties to form the government. 
"I wish to express my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former Commissioner of the journalist. 
Monti has not explicitly confirmed the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome. 
The "framework is now well established," he added. 
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal, and meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis, the cost of debt has driven into an intolerable level. 
The new government led by the former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a tough austerity package, which was demanded by the eurozone politicians to regain the shattered trust in Italy. 
The pressure to rush to Monti, compounded by the volatile market situation, following which the Italian government bonds for 10 years were burdened with 7% interest. This is in line with the state, in which Greece and Ireland have been forced to apply for the European rescue package. 
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian employers' association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government on all sides." 
We believe that this government is the last chance, so that Italy can emerge from this emergency situation. 
The chances of success to Monti's have been through the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign because of the crisis on Saturday, increased substantially. 
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are designed to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party. 
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members opposed to a majority government consisting of technocrats, particularly the Monti. 
Support from Parliament 
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unbeliebten austerity measures. 
Opposition to his efforts, or the delay of the reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets. 
The Italian association of foreign banks, with his suggestion that a failure to Monti's was a disaster, is also under pressure. 
Monti began on Monday with his discussions with political parties, trade unions and employers' associations, as well as with youth and women's organizations. 
Tuesday evening, the round is supposed to be completed. 
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, as a response to the crisis an extremely rapid change of government has set in motion. 
After a brief revival at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the cost of the Italian government bonds reached critical limits. 
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be too much for the current eu-rettung screen. 
Monti said that his government had until the next elections, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that the politicians give it time to implement the reforms will only be preferable to replace those elections. 
Monti said he would like to see politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedures imposed by the pressure of the financial markets. 
Political sources point out that the mutual suspicion and disagreements between the parties, the inclusion of people from the complicated political life.
