ADB urges Asia to help in the rescue of the euro zone 
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank ADB) calls on India and China to save the euro zone to assist in its heavy debt crisis, in order to avoid a long-term downward trend, which will slow down the growth of the economy in Asia. 
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world, "everything in your power" must do in order to ensure the recovery of the currency bloc, either by the International Monetary Fund or by directly to speed up mutual agreements. 
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), the "dispassionate" look at the problems in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leadership and European resources through Asia to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy helps. 
"We are all in the same boat." 
"Everyone is so helpful that Europe can help out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. 
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune." 
"If China and India can help, then by all means." 
Europe's monetary union was in the past few months in a severe debt crisis. 
In the past few days Italy's interest costs rose to dangerous, and the Prime Minister, both from Italy and Greece have resigned. 
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls, the leading emerging countries must unite to support the euro zone. 
Mr. Nag said that any support in Asia will be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the eu-rettung Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - the European partners will offer greater bargaining power in Asia. 
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro zone, as the domestic economy is suffering from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows. 
"No one wants to see that the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent," he said. 
"We are facing great challenges, and we must maintain a high growth level." 
"It is not an option, it is a task, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women." 
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans, even if they are facing major economic challenges. 
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult, the 1.2 billion people in India to sell aid for Europe, of which more than 800 million out of $2 or less a day in their lives. 
"At some point they will find that the Greeks retire 50 and holidays are spent on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said. 
Lee Howell, executive director of the World Economic Forum, asked why India's reserves should be used in Greece, the numerous and well paid employees to keep in the public sector, with jobs in bad geleitetet losses einbringe nden institutions such as the railways. 
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the euro zone "significant knock-on effects" on the whole of Asia. 
The ADB forecast an economic growth of 7,5% in Asia for the years 2011/is now facing "the risk of division" because of the threat from Europe. 
He said that vulnerable emerging markets "contingency plans" should prepare themselves for a downward trend and a significant outflow of capital to protect their partnerships.
