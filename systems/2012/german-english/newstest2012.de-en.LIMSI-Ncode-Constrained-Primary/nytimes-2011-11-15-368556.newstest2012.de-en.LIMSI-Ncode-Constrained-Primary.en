Union of carers will take legal action against the city because of layoffs 
The union, the hundreds of school managers, who last month lost their jobs, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as layoffs because of their disproportionate influence on the schools, which teach poor students, are not necessary and discriminatory. 
The lawsuit is probably the last chance the union, county council 37, in their efforts to reverse the layoffs, is still open. 
Six hundred seventy-two school workers, child care coordinators and other staff members with the lowest paid employees of the city and were on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, the trade union leader and political revenge have described that last year the city access to a health care fund, the working groups, had refused, with which the budgetary gap should be closed. 
This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities. 
At a hearing of the council said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, in the last month, the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June. 
A member of the council shot back and told him that spezifiziere had nothing in the budget that the school aid workers would be laid off. 
Officials from the City Council 37 said they had warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced. 
The complaint is Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education listed the city as defendants and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of whom are nonwhite or Latin American women, like most of the aid workers who have lost their jobs. 
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city was not the case, and therefore could not comment on their individual claims. 
According to a draft copy of the New York Times, the union has been on the number of redundancies at the schools concentrated in the slums of the city, in order to support a complaint about unequal treatment; they claim that poor schools have lost more workers, because they are chronically underfunded. 
It lays down that, while there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side and TriBeCa, 17 school workers in District 23 in ville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 workers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were dismissed. 
With the loss of five of the eight school workers in the public school in Harlem, 36, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood betuchter parents can organise the donations to offset budget cuts." 
P. S.: the budget of the 36th Distrikts this year was cut by 3,26 percent, but it also lost money when the city of its calculation method for the extra funding for any urban vine changed. 
The union also complained that the head of the high schools by the language in a memo were headed in the wrong approach, which authorized the release of the care coordinators. 
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess" (German) in the United States usually the switch of a teacher from the payroll describes a school in a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office. 
"Sechsundsechzig care coordinators have been laid off," says the draft.
