Europe has invented the democracy now remains to rethink the European democracy 
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive commodity. 
The European continent should remind themselves, who after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, of the Gulag, but also of Franco in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece. 
Some believed that it will be enough to exercise the voting rights, and direktest possible way for democracy for all time to win over their enemies. 
You know since Napoleon "small," that was a feature of the spirit. 
The general election law, the necessary condition of democracy is not sufficient condition and may well be "repression," as it was then the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said. 
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of forces, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction. 
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and, above all, politics and democratic crisis. 
The change of heart of the Greek Wahr-Falsch-Referendums could have been doubly interesting character in this respect: the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the unsettling feeling of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit. 
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated. 
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction. 
We have nothing to gain, in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which, in accordance with the requirements and has been organised in a perverse sequence. 
A free ticket for the European single ruler or a leap into the void of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen. 
No, we want hacke lit, but a collective task, from right, clear and steady, an election and democracy, this time at the European level. 
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, in fact, no longer where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe. 
It is all over Europe, which is bowing to the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which is suffering under his powerlessness and his lack of solidarity. 
It is all over Europe, which is humiliated at international level. 
It is concerned about sovereign transfers towards Europe - it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and so that every single one of its affiliated nations. 
The urgency is that the national sovereignty of the leadership of the European project. 
Because it is situated on the whole, whether the Europeans will reduce the burden of their debts, free from the markets and can introduce a future through investment. 
The exit from the crisis has made decisions at European level to the condition, which cannot be taken without a complete democratic legitimacy, without us quite sure to lead to destruction. 
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, it was about fighting, and now everyone is pushing the European economic governance. 
I agree. 
But this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as they have in mind - that would be a renewed foolishness and another impasse. 
We need a new stage of European construction. 
In order to create the Republic in France, it took the Republicans to "create." 
The revolution of interests alone was not enough here. 
This instruction remains valid. 
We need to have an economic level better integrated Europe. 
This can only be achieved by a political, democratic Europe, to create a truly European national sovereignty. 
We need Europeans to build Europe.
