Athens casts doubt again 
Papadimos says that the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement 
The risk premia in the level of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece strays even further in the maze that leads to the great European debt crisis. 
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more likely is a response to pressure from Brussels as a genuine belief that the political forces that is slowly backed by facts. 
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the 100 days have agreed on his appointment may be too short for their implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that he supported the new austerity measures, and in any case, his call for new elections on the planned date, 19 February, will be back. 
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions that were made at the summit of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government will reach its peak. 
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first steps. 
Nevertheless, Samaras acknowledges the doubts about his attitude is not enough: "We are committed to supporting the interim government, but otherwise nothing." 
The Conservative leader was a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body of the 8 000 million Athens urgently needed entsperren, and he made it clear that he did not pledge would approve of the implementation of the austerity measures. 
But the European Commission, because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum is still irritated, yesterday reaffirmed its demand was not changed: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "a clear written agreement as soon as possible" to sign up. 
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" would come to Athens to discuss with the new government, "as for the payment of the sixth paragraph" in excess of 8 000 million euros "is needed," although there is still no final date. 
The Greek tangle has yet for a while thread.
