The mission ended, Congress prepared to Libya 
Ultimately, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington have to agree on the riots in Libya. 
Everything which was necessary to do so was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference. 
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations decides the Senate a resolution, which the chairman, John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), with Libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage" praises. 
"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, who have started with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry. 
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties." 
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the debate. 
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or condemnation of the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO. 
In June, Kerry and McCain, a resolution which restricted the use of military force authorized by the United States in Libya. 
The law has been in the Senate rejected by a broad fringe of both parties, and there was no vote. 
But on the same day, this bill in the Senate, the House also approved a decision to cut funding for US operations in Libya. 
As a result, the US-Mission got into a kind of legislative fege fire - with a Congress that may have been angry enough, Obama's approach to criticise, within the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to him once the rug from under our feet. 
Then there was the indecision of Congress overtaken by the events. 
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. 
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. 
Now, the Senate may be ready to act. 
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulated the people of Libya for their enormous courage and their extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners, who support military operations to protect the people in Libya, for their exceptional courage and professionalism." 
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy." 
Will the new measures the full support of the body responsible for foreign relations or they will divide the legislators, as did the Act of June? 
The latest version of the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (indiana), the spitzen republikaner of the committee. 
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he has so far been the final version of the new law had not yet seen. 
According to Capitol Hill, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislaturperiode of the Republicans and some Democrats. 
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area in time to vote in the Senate or Congress. 
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they tried often enough. 
Lattes amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments, which were presented to the Congress and include a whole range of issues. 
Some are double - the same law was also presented both the Congress and the Senate - while others differ only slightly. 
There are only in the Senate at least 15 versions of the haushaltsänderung compensation and a further dozen "federal spending under control." 
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly rookie with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they are such a measure "written." 
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress will vote on an amendment to the budget adjustments. 
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change. 
In addition to the budget, some members want to see the number of provisions that members of Congress can present limit, while the Republicans, José E. Serrano (New York), the limit of two terms of office of the president wants to lift. 
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments, which, among other things, the right to guarantee a good education and health care. 
One amendment, which prohibits a marriage of equal gender, as well as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring presentation. 
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws, when two drittel of the states they reject. 
For example, how to propose the changes so much faster than in the past few years. 
In the 111th Congress, legislators 77 such changes, 110; Congress 66. 
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly more than 150 amendments proposed every two years, according to the figures, which the Senate Library is available. 
But they were not much more successful than today. 
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress already in 1789.
