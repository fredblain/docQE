Portugal is very confident 
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism about the return game against Bosnia (22:00) Tuesday in Lisbon. 
The Hinspiel had two teams lacked the objectivity. 
"At the end of this 90 minutes, we will have a happy team and, above all, be a happy country." 
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine. 
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his Nationalelf, for which he is responsible for September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship. 
For Portugal, which means only 90 minutes in the Beatitudes. 
But there is a match to play, and a abzuservieren opponent, and Bosnia. 
In view of the Hinspiel (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the die has not yet been taken. 
Portugal dominated for more than an hour clear the game, but the team was not able to cause the important mark, which would have taken the pressure off her. 
"This is a good result, but there is a certain amount of risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor." 
Back home, however, in her bright erstrahlend Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced, before an audience, which also is likely to be hot in the game, even though the game, of course, was announced as a "very tight," said the optimistic, but lucid Bento. 
"We expect a very close match, but we are fully convinced, to be able to gain the upper hand," said the 42 year-old Portuguese coach. 
"We continue to have a 50% chance in the Euro 2012 to be" watered down, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz. 
The draw on Friday in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to reach a goal and win. 
A draw is the Bosnians, who is also a gateway, has already been enough. 
"This is a good result, but there is a certain amount of risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor," Bento regrets. 
"We will be able to compete against a team which has great technical qualities and possesses players with many individual qualities," he added. 
As has already been in Zenica, the Portuguese have already started to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians, "they have no time for reflection." 
A good idea, under the condition that it will be implemented this time.
