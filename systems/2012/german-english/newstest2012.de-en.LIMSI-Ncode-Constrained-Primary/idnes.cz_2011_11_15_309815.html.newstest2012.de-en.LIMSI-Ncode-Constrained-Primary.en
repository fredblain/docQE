Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist 
In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn, I had a little bit of gemeckert, a bit too much substance to it was the beginning. 
Since I was not aware at all, which is still. 
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how the "place." 
It is expected to be even worse. 
The closer examination, more information and practical challenges are before us. 
But even if the course is held on Saturdays and Sundays, yet it is well documented. 
This time we discussed with the director Alena (the course is not a single man), as it attracts a woman who has not been a perfect proportioniert figure. 
And that is, after all, most of us. 
Some people have a short neck, the other a young figure without proper trends and others are mollig. 
It is a matter of Stylist, broad shoulders to conceal optical, to extend the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern bends. 
We also got pointers about how to make a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a large bosom, wide hip and all slim waists - beautiful and attracts figur stressed, without being overly provocative. 
If, for example the difference between Taille and Hüften is so great that the skirt or trousers does not really fit, should be at least a piece of schneidern. 
This will certainly not regret, because good clothing is simply unaffordable. 
In such a tailor-made coat you feel much better than in a bar, go high and verrutscht Taille absteht, etc. 
Young people can afford, in turn, clothing with wrinkles, baus, Applikationen, embroidery or Raffung to bear. 
With this amount of information and figur types, I am glad that I have a whole week, I will do everything thoroughly. 
And yet I am afraid that in view of the assigned homework is almost impossible to achieve. 
Each of the teilnehmerins rate was allocated a Promi, for which it is to come up with suitable attire - clothes and evening. 
In doing so, we are the current design, the fashion style of the star and his Figurtyp. 
I am supposed to Miranda Kerr, " " you may be out of the campaign, Victoria Secret know. 
I juble inside, because for me personally, this is much better, for example, than Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, in recent times has grown to more than 100 kilos (' oh well, that is a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez. 
The garments we always envy in magazines or on the Internet, first and then represented graphically. 
In the "mood board," as the outcome is known, then our very personal style and our relationship with the graphic design. 
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings. 
The Stylist models not only physically, but also makes the so-called product side in the Journal (after a specific target, for example handtaschen, Mäntel, etc.). 
They told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník. 
But the first Sunday. 
This means that a Stylist must have a good overall picture. 
The filled Saturday with information on Figurentyps was tempered by three visitors from the industry. 
The Stylist, Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben. 
Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion and Stylist should be able to take advantage of this. 
And eingeschickter Stylist with a single piece of clothing to work in very different ways. 
The magic word is variability. 
This can be such a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but can also bear on the naked body, to attract sales of shoes and wear it as a dress. 
It is enough, the sleeves and the collar hochzukrempeln, and the whole Look is quite different. 
"Does that," he said. 
But most came the following advice: "First of all, you know what the rules are perfect." 
"Only then can they violate them," said Jakub. 
At last, I understand why we need pauken all these doctrines, which you can combine with what and why, even if you fashion journal often gets to see quite different. 
Not to mention of fashion schaus. 
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a Stylist much more clothing variant must have prepared than he ultimately photographed. 
So you have to be a Fashion story with ten pages (e.g. ten attire), be prepared for at least 15 stylen. 
And the clothes on the photograph in combination with other Accessoires sometimes looks very different than in reality. 
All of this must be expected in the form of attire. 
The fact that image and, a sometimes make up half of the success that we also confirmed Jan Pokorný. 
Since you need only look at Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer, from which image and marketing a world star. 
In the Czech Republic, the services of a rather reserved Stylist. 
Even celebrities often think this is wasted money (the main thing is that I am, as I was of secondary importance). 
And if anyone can be stylen from us, then we should expect that he or she very likely a whole heap of other (smaller) size than he or she needs in reality. 
Then you need only turn to googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press, writes back to the appropriate Promi or decreased, and so on. 
Jan and Mario set us on Sunday not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the clothes "to assemble them." 
In his work, above all, he needs to communicate with the people he stylt and he must be a shrewd psychologist. 
People judge without anzubiedern and his opinion. 
"If we have a director appointed to sift through their clothes cupboard and to complement fine pieces, then we cannot get rid of the whole storage cupboard and say, my God, this is terrible." 
"We need at least a few worthy things, which recommends what you can do about it," says Mario. 
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "job" must include. 
So a bag of Taille zuknöpft and which carries all the necessary Proprietäten. 
Apart from such obvious things, such as scissors, hair removal or security nadeln Abroller they also contains such Utensils as nylon thread (a Stylist helps the photographing of products, such as handbags or avoid) specific clips with which the clothes will be accelerated if it is too big (electric nadeln or other Klemmes are prohibited, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug. 
This means that we must not only listen, but also can try something practical, we learned how to get it right. 
Even in the case of photography at the Atelier, where the floor is, you can damage the shoe base, let alone the outside. 
We have o klebten and klebten.... 
With the gap, we must not even touch the shoes, so that they are not damaged. 
So we really need to be sent. 
Mario delighted me by my "creation," praised without restrictions. 
The aforementioned skill is not exactly my strength. 
All of this was only a fraction of what we hear on the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs. 
One thing is now clear - to address the Styling at professional level, is not an easy task.
