The "Empörten" call on the authorities in New York 
Hundreds of demonstrators huddling in tents on the zuccotti Square. 
A large proportion of the clearance order came after he changed his location in a nearby park. 
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street on Tuesday urged the authorities of New York when they tried again with a court warrant to enter the Manhatten-Platz after dawn had been removed from the room and had tried a different place in the Big Apple to fill. 
Hundreds of demonstrators huddling in the zuccotti Square, in which they are with a court warrant, the "Empörten" once again allowed tents at this point, to gain access to, meanwhile, had a different part of the movement of the clearance order and occupied a park further north in the city, where it came to nine arrests. 
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to campen on the place, we find ourselves in a different place, and the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with petitions and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the movement "Ocupy Wall Street." 
Bray was pointing out that the response of the "Empörten" on the evacuation of their tent camps, directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York had been ordered to court, where Judge Lucy Billings was an injunction banning the forced evacuation of the place and the protesters authorized the tents. 
It also occupied the "Empörten" a new park, which is at the crossroads of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entrance to the holland Tunnel, the New York and New Jersey, and is the property of Trinity Church. 
They were able to place at least one hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray can give no precise figures, but he assured the Efe news agency that he had seen several journalists in handcuffs. 
The organisation said it had hundreds of people joined at this stage, in which a delegation of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and had arrived with the police for mediation. 
In the meantime, the zuccotti (a site on private property) closed in anticipation of a court hearing is scheduled for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the light grey held evacuation is to be analysed. 
Some of the demonstrators through the square wore photographic copies of these court orders and distributed them; they gave them even some police officers, the place where "some small clashes" as a result, Bray said, which indicated that some police officers, protesters were beaten. 
The court ordered the authorities to ban members of Occupy Wall Street to remove from the room, as well as the use of "laws, which were adopted after the occupation, and to prohibit the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had already been used to return to the park." 
Mayor Bloomberg is clearly in front of the press, which as a result of this court orders the reopening of the place for the public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted, and the demonstrators, he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to return to this place with tents and sleeping bags. 
The mayor defended himself in his grey conducted evacuation of the zuccotti grounds, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and the decision was made because the demonstrators "contravened the law." 
Bloomberg said he would have given the order to the evacuation of the place, because it "was transformed into a place where the people were not protesting, but to break the law and, in some cases, in order to harm other people" because "threats have received some shops" and the surrounding community bangten "to her life." 
"The evacuation of the dawn was sickening and shows that Bloomberg is essentially on the protection of financial interests and not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers," the spokesman added the movement of the anschuldigte mayor "does not respect the freedom of press." 
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" were informed that they thought about it, "significant actions" to be organised for Thursday, along with local organisations and trade unions in the two months, the protests have been ongoing since 17 September to commemorate.
