Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defence 
Defence Minister Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken the national security unnoticed, so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the war zones in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts. 
The Pentagon is already making cuts in excess of 450 trillion dollars over the next decade, but fears that further cuts to 600 billion dollars or more will be needed if the Congress can reach no conclusion in the spending. 
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. 
He said that a failure of the Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% across-the-board cuts, as well as a halt numerous new projects. 
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a reckless way that would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot three quarters of a ship or a building to buy - and other serious harm modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators. 
"We also would be forced to take involuntary to separate a large part of our civilian personnel and, given that the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians, in order to be able to achieve the goal." 
"These amendments would destroy the faith of those who maintain our armed forces and seriously damage our preparedness." 
The cuts were eventually hit the combat forces," Panetta said. 
"While the war quotas in the anti-terror campaign are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference would adversely affect the war effort in the budget," Panetta warned. 
"Recruitment has been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, support for the war." 
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, which will lead to late payments to dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted." 
The two senators responded Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Department of Defense. 
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power." 
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she Panettas letter published. 
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on us." 
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United hurry up and whose commitment should not be allowed." 
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase the pressure on a budget compromise or step up demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen. 
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, despite his many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces difficult choices. 
At a press conference in the last week, the defence minister, painting a bleak picture, which could face a military shell, but without heart. 
"It is a ship without sailors." 
"It is a brigade without ammunition." 
"It is a geschwader without adequately trained pilots." 
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers who have the ability to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon. 
"It is a military force, there is a lack of morality and alert, and is not in a position to absorb it with potential enemies." 
"You can really be angry." 
In an annex to his letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global commitment and response capacity, which creates an unacceptable risk in future military operations." 
Panetta said that some of the biggest projects the removal could fall victim, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early planning stage. 
This list also includes fighter planes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new aircraft bomb, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new litt oral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee. 
If the further development and testing of the F35 stop, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 Dollar billion, but its supporters say that it is an important next step in the build-up, so that possible threats posed by China and other opponents can be averted.
