More controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be revised following threats by delayed US-Genehmigung 
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to slow down in the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and environmentalists, reassured that the pipeline based company is trying to plan the project new, so that we can return to normal. 
Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area is being diverted to the sand hills of Nebraska. 
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliament building in Nebraska. 
Alex Pourbax of canada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course. 
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course would be reviewed, the area of sand hills in Nebraska, as well as the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large water supply, meide. 
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, on Fox News. 
The new environmental review, which the Foreign Office has ordered, may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision. 
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision is a function of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support. 
The 1700 mile pipeline in Canada was linked to the Gulf of Mexico. 
It would be 700 000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to pump the refineries in Texas. 
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states. 
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20 000 jobs. 
But the Nebraskas lawmakers, who oppose the plan, weigh up the laws, a departure from the region in the sand hills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation, to enforce. 
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the chief accountant of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues. 
One is whether a lobbyist, who was recruited by canada, Paul Elliott, the 2008 adviser of Hillary Clinton was in a conflict of interest. 
The other is whether a company, which has been charged with carrying out the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected with canada.
