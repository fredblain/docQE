Moleskine, a notiz marker. 
From an Italian company about 15 years ago created Moleskine would now back a new style to the letter. 
It has a flair for adventure, candlelight with the letter came hours. 
The notiz book of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with his black square cover, his elastic, eierschalfarbenen sides, such as aged over time. 
The Moleskine notiz book, as it is known today, however, has been created in 1997. 
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at that time, a distinguiert designer notiz book on the market. 
Maria Sebregondi, then special adviser to the company, is charged with the roll-out of the new product. 
The notiz book was a traditional production technology, called the Mole inspired (mole skin) start, which describes a Baumwollack, for example, will be used for a salary of Polsterb√§nken. 
This kind of notiz book was among writers and travellers. 
"Moleskine has an old and almost forgotten subject to revive until the twentieth century avantgardistischer artist was regarded as a legend," explained Maria Sebregondi, now a brand coordinator at Modo Modo. 
The success is one. 
Between 2006 and 2010, sales will increase by 26% and establish itself with a paragraph of 12.7 million piece. 
This is a far cry from the usual production in the first few years, in which only 3 000 notiz books were conceived.

It is difficult to prepare a phantom image of the buyer, as the notiz book as well as businesspeople as well as students and professionals. 
Moleskine is the image more cosmopolitan, cultured and intellectual customers. 
The small Italian company, which in its early days was among 12 workers, now employs more than 100 employees and has been in place since 2008 on two offices; one in Milan, the other in New York. 
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores and on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small Boutiques of city centres and to impose its identity. 
"We have the spirit and followed his new desk needs, despite the recovery of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi. 
This cultural trait which is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand exposure called "Detour (route) ," in which architects and artists their own notebooks. 
In August, the company at the Locarno Film Festival is also a cover with leopard models on the market. 
Moleskine benefited from his success and the cultural Zeitgeist and common sense to diversify its products: bags, diary, pen, computer... the brand, the whole range of articles. 
A success, there are some begrudgers brings to the plan: in the autumn of 2006, Modo was Modo from the investment fund SG Capital Europe, bought the current Syntegra Capital, and suggested that a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
