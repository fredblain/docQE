As a lie revealed 
A glance at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies in daily life.

The leadership of Penh State is accused of the President's, since it has allegedly withheld reports, according to which a retired football coach boy was sexually abused. 
In the past week has been heard about an open microphone, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy and US President Barack Obama claimed that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. 
Lies destroy careers and shaking countries.

The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair. 
And then, of course, no one forgets that it has seen the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered when he during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky lied. 
Stories about Schummeln in school and college tests are widespread. 
There have been incidents in which teachers have laid down their student testing, so that they themselves well in their performance reviews dastanden. 
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and Schummeln. 
How much deception we see? 
As studies show that we are lying every day between 10 and 200 times. 
There are many, but these lies are lies. 
Another study shows that strangers each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting. 
To detect lies, or "lie detection" is a learning is important for every person, and that both personal and professional reasons. 
Far from being a social game such as, for example, in which it is the goal, "you!" is the Enttarnen of a deception, a serious knowledge based on scientific data over the past six decades have been collected at prestigious universities, which had carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology. 
As a result of the research is that most of the old myths about which lies were revealed. 
Look in the eyes. 
You stottern, stammeln, suffused with and not always zappeln. 
As a result, we should not conclude that these liars difficult to identify and treat. 
A Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth by giving him something about the structure of the claim that the fine talk, learn about issues and timing. 
I have spent several years, the scientific findings of the comprehensive and steadily growing field of study in exposing, and it is clear that the Enttarnen of a deception is a modern ability, which is easy to learn and help us find in our complex world, especially if the closing or the questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibilities. 
Good liars are very good to other people, to arouse their interest and to control their own emotions, and they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others. 
Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertiert people are more likely to lie than introverted men, that men are more often "driven" lying spin than women whose lies "to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people anlügen their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies"). 
We also know that if a person has been exposed as a culprit, while others feel less guilty, this person to have lied. 
As you can see whether or not someone is lying? 
First, by watching the normal behaviour of this person. 
This is what is known as "Baselining," the starting position. 
It is a point of reference for the subsequent assessment of changes. 
Keep a close eye on the attitude, the smile, the quality of their participants. 
You should know better, when someone is normally standing trippelt with the foot, so that they do not unfairly when he trippelt during a meeting with the foot. 
Then you look at accumulations more startling verbal and nonverbaler behaviors. 
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells ring, not as proof of a in exposing. 
People who are cheating might freeze when they try to remind themselves of their history, and perhaps their feet toward the door, or they are towards outcome, change their position on significant way or show a "relaxation after the recruitment interview," this deep, diverting Ausatmen and the change in attitude, if they are all tough issues. 
Interrogator often mistakenly signal that a conversation has come to an end only after this relaxing to look for a job interview. 
You also pay attention to the language of your participants. 
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous, when he used the past tense when he claimed that his wife was still on life and triggered a national search for her. 
Täuschende people can also use a distanzierend language: "I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you have a tricky question repeated in its entirety. 
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle. 
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer to a tricky question: "Well... in order to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of our knowledge and understanding." 
This is the answer rather than factual, which often set the alarm bells ringing. 
There is no magic cure for the Enttarnen of lies, but they can learn skills, thanks to whom one in exposing is possible. 
With these skills, everyone can rarely be the victims of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
