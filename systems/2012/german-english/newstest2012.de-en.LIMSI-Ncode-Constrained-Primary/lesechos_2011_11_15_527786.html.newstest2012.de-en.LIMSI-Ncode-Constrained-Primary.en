Austria 
Registration of a "Goldenen budgetary rule" in the Constitution. 
The Austrian government in the power of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition has decided on Tuesday, a "golden budgetary rule" to include in the Constitution, in order to reduce public deficits, and even a possible degradation by credit rating agencies in the Top-Bonit√§t to avoid Austria (AAA). 
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner, Mr. Faymann, highly personal, this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers had announced, even though the public Austrian public debt stands at 74,6%, which is far above the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, but significantly below the debt levels of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain. 
"If the solvency of Austria was not a blow from AAA to AA +, we would have three billion euros each year, interest rates, extra pay," said Michael Spindelegger, Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democrat foreign minister. 
Austria is also a requirement of the Brussels summit of the Member States of the euro zone on 26 October, the Heads of State and Government at the time would have been the inclusion of reducing public deficits by the end of the year 2012, as well as a return to the public bank account balances in the Constitution or by adopting a similar law requires. 
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model," because Germany was the first European country that such a "rule" was included in the Constitution. 
By the year 2017, the structural budget deficit every year to 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP), from 2017, the structural budget deficit of the federal state should 0,35% of GDP does not exceed, whereas the regional states, as well as the communities should have balanced budgets. 
The aim is on the horizon of 2020/21, the budget deficit under the Maastricht Treaty set out 60% criterion.
