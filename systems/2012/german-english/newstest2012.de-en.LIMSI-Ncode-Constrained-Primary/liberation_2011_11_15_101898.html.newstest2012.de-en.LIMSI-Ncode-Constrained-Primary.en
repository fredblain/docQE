Energy policy: 
Facts should prevail over dogma 
Can an issue that is not based on short-term considerations or should be treated as a result of emotions, it is certainly the energy policy. 
Availability and cost of electricity in a direct impact on the purchasing power, as well as the competitiveness of enterprises. 
It is reasonable to hold an election for a reason, on this issue and think about the position of nuclear energy. 
The debate will only bear fruit if the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are being explored. 
The French people should express their opinion on objective facts, make rational data. 
Although 7 billion people on this planet are driving up the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, is not a huge proportion of the world's population to forgo a vital element. 
At the same time, we must alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce steady electricity without the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate, to forget, in order to fight against climatic anomalies. 
The accident of Fukushima changed any of these parameters. 
That is why blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power. 
This is not the case in Belgium, which raises its decision on the need to find a replacement strings as an alternative source, in Switzerland, which intends to build the latest generation of nuclear power plants. 
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, are pursuing their projects against it will continue with determination. 
For its part, the United States have decided after Fukushima, their park another unit, making the plant shut down after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island are again in operation. 
Even if the renewable energy sources, German model is sometimes portrayed as a model, but contradicts the reality the discourse. 
The election in Berlin will be an increase in the price of electricity prices, the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in carbon dioxide emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants. 
The entirety of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months ago. 
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection. 
Denmark is one European leader in wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy; so there are his CO2-Ausstösse, as well as its electricity price by 65% and 50% higher than the European average. 
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, pay our neighbours in contrast to our French households by 40% higher electricity bills. 
As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key element of competitiveness, as well as a measure of stability in the industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe. 
Any significant reduction in respect of nuclear power would be a sharp increase in the price of energy, which the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion. 
Polls showed that a price that the vast majority of French people, and neither is willing to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source. 
Let us remind ourselves that the energy policy of our country has made it an industry with 125.00 directly and create 410 000 jobs. 
Due to its strong export nature it brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and makes these creators of countless jobs. 
If France decision to get out of nuclear power, it would be a large part of these SMEs fall victim, and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more. 
What electricians would be an EPR designed to operate at 60 years if the demise of its producers is inevitable? 
In order to solve the energy equation, we must acknowledge that just a little bit like a devil is a panacea for the production of electricity. 
The company Areva developed low-carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy from the complementarity of energy sources. 
The highest possible safety standards to maintain nuclear power is an absolute imperative. 
In France, we have a safety authority, uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants such as, for example, is carrying out the construction in Flamanville. 
Their teams, who have made a name for their professionalism, are the security obsessed. 
In the space of 50 years, the three nuclear industry has experienced serious accidents. 
Only a single, and Three Mile Island, has been under normal operating conditions; it did so without any consequences for humans and the environment. 
Chernobyl was the drama of reactor construction, as well as unendschuldbares, human error. 
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters have caused an unprecedented scale, the deaths of several tens of thousands of people. 
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident, as well as after the two previous had done. 
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security forces of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power stations, the EPR is a draft of its resilience in the face of such phenomena possible. 
Since the electric technikers is deemed desirable to build a nuclear power plant, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein, could be the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development. 
It is absolutely necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber, as well as economic, social and financial situation of our country determined.
