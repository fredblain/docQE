More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 per cent of all pupils and 5 per cent of all children are overweight. 
Recent surveys have shown - obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles. 
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the environment in which he or she and the examples are surrounded. 
The tables are adipöser children sausages were up to 50% more likely on the table than in families in which important children live. 
More than 19 percent of the obese children had on the eve of the education campaign under the slogan "obesity is not a coincidence" chips for dinner. 
In families with sport is not exactly the favorite, but it also affects the majority of today's students, only 15 percent replied that their parents at least once in the week found time for active movement. 
Survey of 900 children 
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, nearly 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic. 
This was the second year of action "obesity is not a coincidence," the general health insurance company and the company Unilever will be supported.

No breakfast and sausage for dinner 
Experts point out that even relatively minor matters, such as the regular breakfast time of the family are important for the healthy development of a child. 
In the Czech Republic but only 23 percent of the families of the pupils. 
And, in most families, everyone frühstückt for themselves. 
The worst was the fact that every tenth family is not gefrühstückt at all. 
The breakfast is a cornerstone of a healthy daily diet. 
The survey test, among other things, to the day that the families with obese children much more often unhealthy chips consumed. 
And almost everyone - regardless of weight, drink every day sweet soft drinks (70%) 
Although more than 40 per cent of children surveyed sport, but only less than half of their parents do that - which is only 15 per cent.

Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and girls from 13 schools), offered opportunities for appetite and opinion to compile their own menu. 
"As far as Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is a far cry from the ideal of a healthy diet.
