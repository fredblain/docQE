V Need for steroids: "The run" - the illegal race across America 
Recession 
The original careless journey through a series of completely preventable, dilettanti error on a routine journey to an early class. 
While it was able to meet the ambitions for the most part, but what is the point, though obviously had no desire to do a bit more. 
Even before he came to the counter, the new section with the subtitle "the run" high expectations. 
He Versprach the old game show "Need for steroids" to move a step back into a new dimension, and in the spielbar demonstration models he actually seemed not only one of many Action-Rennspielen. 
We were also curious how longer passages in which the main protagonist in rising from the car and on foot. 
But as it is used for NFS, is in fact a lot differently than we had expected. 
Of course, there are potentially quite decent Arkade-Rennen, but, overall, the game will be diminished by some unnecessary mistakes in this series of more or less a few years are present. 
So it is not a mistake, but more signs of unbegreiflichen laziness in principle of game developers. 
The adventure begins very well. 
Firstly, it will be introduced into the story, whose main character, Jack certain issues of personal character; the only solution seems to be an illegal race across America. 
In San Francisco, on the west coast, to the steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York. 
The basic idea involves a whole range of interesting elements. 
The entire route is in 10 stages and more than fifty individual race. 
This means that each race will be fought on the other route and that the various stages in various sufficiently diverse and interesting environment. 
There is no moment the impression that the game would continue to offer the same thing. 
Some areas are still very nice, even though the technical level of graphic display which goes beyond the earlier parts of the series. 
So no bewegende. 
But the journey through the desert, autumn landscape or high through deep snow landscape we have a very pleasant visual. 
Every now and again bring atypical elements a little change in the individual race. 
In the desert, for example, you will be surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts the view. 
In the mountains, in turn, must be extremely careful that we will not be buried by an avalanche. 
By the way, are fairly well incorporated the individual race. 
Although only a few, but they are insufficient. 
For a while trying to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single opponent. 
And also interfering with the police, who wants to blow the whole thing. 
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car. 
This is more about some interactive Animations, in which Jack fleeing anybody else, and where he must help the players by pushing the right button at the right moment. 
So there is nothing complicated. 
It is surprising, however, that the game is much less of such passages, as one would expect (concrete only three). 
Ultimately, it is more likely to benefit, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned on the elements that make the game more. 
This model is in the Fußtapfes of the previous sections. 
In other words, from today's viewpoint, no trees, on the other hand, you could not claim that it would be a bad thing. 
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations must look elsewhere. 
But a troubled Rennfahren, the local model will continue to perform very well, even though the competition could be better. 
In the meantime, so far, everything is fine. 
Real problems are emerging only after a certain time. 
In contrast to the model, the model is not quite OK. 
From a game of this type, it is hard to expect that it is difficult to calculate Deformations and collisions, but if you virtually no impact on any idea how the car is, then it is obviously not everything is in order. 
A typical example: at the close or passing of oncoming cars "touched upon" the other car in some places only slightly in the other, almost identical situation but tailspin and wild performance. 
Or the same scrap metal. 
Thanks to the Restart-Systems is nothing more of it is annoying. 
The remaining arts are resolved: if you write-off or ends up far away from the route, then throws the game back to the last point of the route. 
Only - in every race, only five remaining arts. 
If you have exhausted them, everything is going on. 
Thus, the arts are more such a thing as a tool for the event that something does not succeed, but rely on it should not. 
Sometimes it helps, but not even the Restart, because nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head. 
It is extremely unfortunate that the same things often happen in the same places. 
Some of these trends must be the case in a very specific way, otherwise we simply do not fit. 
Elsewhere at the appropriate juncture "civilian" cars are always in the same configuration, no matter whether it was the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or later a minute. 
This is particularly troublesome in situations when you see that the opponent romped to two oncoming cars, but even before they arrive, the cars are already in such a position that they must navigate around or slow down. 
And it is no matter when you arrive, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose. 
The opponents have even more advantages. 
In the whole game, there are a few places where you are always in the same place will be overtaken by the same opponents, and here again without regard to the timing. 
The most madman's is at the end of the game on the long bridge, which is happening in the body. 
The opponent must seem hell bent on overtaking. 
And if he is, then he is, of course, the view, so they started their own car a few times in Klump. 
What is clear - we want the game to simply make it more exciting and exciting events, but this desire is so clear that they quickly spoiled the joy of the game. 
And that is a pity, because, despite einfacherem model is the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes action that you almost no longer know where it is one of the head. 
And, in principle, no matter what "guilt" - the concept of 50 unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that no boredom can pay, or something completely different... 
An unusual idea is also a change in the course of the race. 
We must not overlook garages, because it is precisely here that we can change the car, even though in most cases, the car is good enough. 
The cars are divided into three categories. 
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines on the highways and exotic sportwagen for the technical crews, for example on the Serpentins in the mountains. 
Hand in hand with the modus operandi of the story is also the aufgaben mode (challenges) - that is, the race in the individual situation, which we know from history. 
This is not just medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, the common tasks (challenges) and history. 
In order to get to higher levels, various objects need to be open-minded, ranging from the car to the grounds for the profile. 
This is at the same time with the role of online Autolog, which, among other things, the results are compared with those of other players, and also provides for further collective functions. 
One of the other incomprehensible Schnitzers is a situation in the last race of the story. 
This is the car in an underground rail tunnels (perhaps), where we were in the dark on the rails long night (or, for that matter). 
The Tacho look points between 150 to 200 km/h (say), but there is a subway and a tough scrap. 
In our editorial, we will probably still argue about whether a blackout of the decision was or whether the authors believe to be so stupid. 
The technical side is not Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall picture is, in most cases quite attractive, and here and there, even brilliant. 
It is all the more galling is that in a few exciting moments, the wiederhol rate is slower, and sometimes quite dramatic. 
This is particularly the case with greater numbers of do where a continuous FPS does not work anyway. 
The Tonwiedergabe is OK, and the sound track is a matter of taste. 
The effort so broad as possible to raise more young audience, a sound track (a lá "of all things" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?! 
The overall picture of Need for steroids: The run? The feelings are more mixed. 
If the game does not mention totally unnecessary mistakes would be diminished, we would have been able to argue with a true ring of conviction that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years. 
But the game seems somehow unfinished. 
For a class of pleasure, but we should be prepared to make a mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eye.
