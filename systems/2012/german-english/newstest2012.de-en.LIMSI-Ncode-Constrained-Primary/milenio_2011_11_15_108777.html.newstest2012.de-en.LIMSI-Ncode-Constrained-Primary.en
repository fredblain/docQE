In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded us that just once in the last 9 November, the electoral body a set of rules on the harmonization of local legislation with the reforms of the federal states had adopted in electoral matters. 
It should be remembered that Michoacán neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor its law on electoral justice had adapted to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they in this round were in force, but the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the Gazette within the timeframe stipulated by the argument that even objections. 
On 9 November, the Supreme Court ruled in Mexico (SCJN) on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and assessment, the voice of the State Ombudsman on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful" because it does not have the right to "decide or a veto against it."

Under the following conditions in one or more electoral packages contained votes will be counted partial results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol on the counting and calculation is not an excessive or it is not in possession of the chairman of the electoral commission or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols. 
In addition, the total count of the total ausgefüllten ballot papers will then be carried out if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the second place is the same or less than one per cent is provided at the beginning of the session is an explicit request from the Partei-bzw and coalition chairman, the second is the aforementioned candidates. 
The counting of votes can also be carried out in its entirety, if it is discovered after completion of the proper calculation that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate on the second place equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party, whose candidate has become the second, and in this case, the electoral packages were subjected to a partial count has been ruled out.
