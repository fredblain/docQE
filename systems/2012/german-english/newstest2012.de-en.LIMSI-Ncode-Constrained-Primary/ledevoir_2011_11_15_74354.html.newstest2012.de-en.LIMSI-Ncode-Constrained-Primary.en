Euthanasia and Freitod must be legalised, a panel of experts 
The Canadians live in denial of death, as a report by the Royal Society of Canada 
The panel said that governments, institutions of health care and doctors about pain linder treatment were prepared for the best palliative means, and this is also about the cancer. 
The Canadian society is living in a state of denial about the death. 
Only 9% of Canadians are really with their doctor to talk about conditions under which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose. 
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report from the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine, are linked. 
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election is, and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision. 
As a start, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent EIU society, the quality of death in 40 countries compared to the Erdballes. 
Although Canada has placed on the 10th grade, the study noted that "the medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to broach the subject of death." 
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, as reported by the Royal Society of Canada ordered experts. 
And despite the overwhelming majority of Canadians want to die at home, but ultimately die 68,6% of those in hospital. 
The whole country has seen the rate of 86% of deaths occurred in a hospital in Quebec, the highest. 
On the sensitive issue regarding euthanasia and etem suicide, the authors of the report with conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already made no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying etem want to carry out suicide. 
Now, however, there are, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalized or drug, no evidence that such abuses in their application, which is the practical implementation of euthanasia or etem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting individuals would entail. 
On the contrary, we meet considerably more cases of such violations, particularly in the countries where there is no legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, such as Jocelyn Downie yesterday, a co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference. 
"Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is clearly illegal." 
"Suicide is practiced in Canada, even though this is clearly illegal," said Jocelyn Downie. 
Canadians support euthanasia 
Let us remind ourselves that according to a reid angus carried out by the year 2010 poll showed 85% of Canadians had spoken in favour of euthanasia, because they are of the opinion that it would allow these people at the end of their career to alleviate their suffering. 
And 66% believe that the issue of legalization of euthanasia was not meant to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people had less value. 
As for the people who have already done an assisted suicide, the respondents represented 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted. 
As for maintenance or suspension of the funds for patients is less clear, as the authors of the report. 
It also suggests that in its recommendation that the criminal law should be indicated that the dumping of funds, for which there was a valid rejection, not as a criminal should apply. 
The panel of experts calls for professionals in the health care system should be trained in the job, a possibility of making the funds at the end of life to be respected, and this without fear criminal prosecution. 
The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked on linder treatment, the best palliative to make money, and this is also about the cancer. 
Finally, the body is calling on the Canadian health care institutions far-reaching used funds for pain relief or final actions, at least to consider, because they just like euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and bez√∂gen on the same procedure. 
Reservations by other experts 
Some experts in the area of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts' report put forward by the Royal Society of Canada. 
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has the attitude of reporting be signed experts among others described as "extreme" as the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final phase set no limits. 
"This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone tired and older than 18 years, another person to ask him to be involved in his suicide," RA Deschamps, who yesterday had seen a summary of the report. 
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report was the responsibility of the individual over all other values, which are involved in social knitted of society. 
Now, he says, there would be "guidelines and commitments in a society." 
Margaret Somerville, expert on health law, also has "a strong resistance" against the conclusions of the report, which they regard as "Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest" titulieren. 
Margaret Somerville, itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular, doubts the reporting details about the Nichtvorliegens of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
