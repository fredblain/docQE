The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome gives details about the plane crash, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed, well known. 
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (secretariat for communications and transport in Mexico) wrote that the findings on the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake district of Mora and a further seven people were killed, pointing out that the helicopter with his whole intact structure directly on the ground, without the pilot should have been able to launch an emergency landing. 
At a press conference said Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communications and transportation, that the pilot had confirmed before the start of the weather conditions had been suitable for the flight. 
"The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 metres high level contact with trees, while the helicopter lost the hull seems to indicate that the helicopters had had several contacts." 
He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he met all the conditions for the transportation of personnel. 
Moreover, he said that during the investigations in the area in which the aircraft was decrepit, no helicopter parts were found. 
"When no aircraft parts were found in other places, the surcharge was the entire structure. 
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he met all the requirements for passenger transport. 
The area has a Schrägung of 7 to 30 degrees. 
At the moment, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could be several months, perhaps even take a year. 
Seinerseits assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for planes and auxiliary services in Mexico) that the helicopters from the Estado Mayor Presidencial flew to the surcharge to travel by air speed and the plane had fallen to a soft Abhang. 
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the impact was a normal flight operation." 
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, six relevant points, which should be taken into account in the investigation. 
Flight: 
In accordance with the standards, it was a flight in accordance with the rules of the IMF, which means that the team sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground should have had. 
Weather conditions: 
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start, while continuing to fly in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico state some low-hanging clouds. 
Elected air routes: 
It is possible that the team because of the clouds, a lower area with a better view of the Cuernavaca-Tal had been selected. 
Impact: 
The Aufprallkoordinaten and the last radar recording of helicopters agree; perhaps it has neither a loss of control over the plane has been a deviation from the flight route. 
Were scattered in the ruins of the aircraft in a limited area. 
Until now, this information suggests that the helicopter was aufgeprallt from and direction. 
The pattern of scattered aircraft residues suggest that the helicopter was aufgeprallt with its intact structure on the ground. 
There is no evidence of fire or explosion. 
The remnants of the plane at the scene of an accident either on fire or explosion. 
The latest findings point to a number of soil pollution. 
During the investigations on the ground, aircraft parts on a total of 9200 feet above sea level, and the terrain, slope and has a Schrägung of seven to thirty degrees. 
The photographs show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break down. 
Some reports indicate that the helicopter had several contacts. 
After a meticulously searching in an area that went beyond the cordoned off area at the scene of an accident, not scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure on the ground.
