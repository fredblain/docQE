Eu-botschaft Vicenová: 
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Euro-sceptics 
"The Treaty of Lisbon has the balance among the various institutions from the road." 
I would not expect that there is such a tough war." 
"It will take five, six years until the dust settling, and all have become accustomed to her new role," began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, its presentation very strongly to the legal faculty. 
How seriously the motto, "this is understandable and openly about Europe," it has already been demonstrated in the first part of its presentation, in which it succeeded, the various institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a straightforward and understandable way to describe some editor of the law faculty of Charles University would have been able to admire. 
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy. 
"Initially, there was criticism that he is too low-key - a grey civil servant, such a role is not equal, but I must say that it has ended up all the time, how well he has taken up the cause. 
"He is a man of twenty-seven Member States listen patiently to communicate with them, and above all has clear ideas about how to move forward with the EU. 
The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said they then answer to the question: who is the real - the European Union? What number I should call? ," in other words, as an important step towards agreement and better visibility of the EU's policy towards countries such as China or India. 
No one wants us to ban our Ölmützer Quargel 
Mrs Vicenová was also on the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, is alive and wants to live in the near future. 
According to the Czech Presidency of two years ago, described it as a success. 
The Czechs had the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for the Eastern Partnership. 
In the case of the government during the presidency, described it as a big negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic. 
The Czech representation in the EU currently has to do all hands full. 
In the words of the ambassador said that it was not only in the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which until now has not yet overcome quite hectic. 
And since the seven-year budget must still be approved by the EU, which is precisely because of the current economic situation makes it much more complicated. 
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, what sectors of the economy must take precedence, which countries and which are less favoured - all of this is now on the agenda. 
The ambassador also reminds me of their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "This is understandable about Europe." 
"If I do not like something, then it is gräulich words, phrases and jargon that no one understands. 
How can I actually know as citizens, whether they are really in Brussels curved or round cucumbers and various large bananas invented or whether someone really wants to ban the Quargel. 
It would have been the land of the EU would also like to be used to get more Czechs in European institutions. 
Europe two or different speeds in prospect 
According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are reputed to be the Eurosceptics more negative than the positive side of the story. 
All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions. 
There are many factors to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to write motivierung letters, and not least the weak support from the Czech side. 
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4. 
"Believe me, if Poland or Hungary comes to me and the Slovaks in the vicinity, then the Frenchman believes, in addition to me:" Hey, what is their heads together - is that your V4? " and makes a pretty sour face. 
According to Ms. Vicenové, expect the EU in future, above all, tough rules on the budget policies of the Member States. 
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of a Europe of two or even at different speeds. 
"We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone. 
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the Institute encourages cooperation." 
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should cooperate, they want and not want to be left out." 
"It is becoming more and more of these institutions, which at the end of a strong" Europe of different speeds, " " expects Mrs Vicenová. 
In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues with impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all Member States, and not only by the countries of the euro zone.
