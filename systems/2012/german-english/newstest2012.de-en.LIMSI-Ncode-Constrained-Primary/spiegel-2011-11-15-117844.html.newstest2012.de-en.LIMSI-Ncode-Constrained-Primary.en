Does the Deutsche Bank deal with agricultural commodities? 
According to online information, Josef Ackermann has asked a working group to examine the speculation for the poor of the world. 
In January the CEO's wants to draw conclusions. 
Hamburg. 
For the German citizen, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn. 
Two thirds of respondents want the Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions out of this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world. 
This is the result of a Forsa-Umfrage on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch. 
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch in mid-October. 
It shows the author Harald Schumann, betting on the global commodity markets prices soar - and the banks are partly to blame for world hunger problem. 
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against deutsche bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to act similarly. 
Originally intended for raw materials were betting that traders hedge against price fluctuations. 
But now, most experts agree that the Zocker has decoupled from supply and demand - and expense of the poor to make profits. 
Unlike the US-Konkurrents Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business was "worth the good reputation of the German bank to be put at risk." 
According to information from ONLINE mirror an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the foodwatch report. 
By the end of the year, the review is expected to be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of the Deutsche Bank - all recommendation, as it is to be handled. 
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell us what the consequences. 
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure. 
Ackermann forge his image 
Foodwatch chief, Thilo Bode, welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food particularly dramatic shows how reckless banks are hurting the common good." 
Ackermann is a top bank lobbyist now especially in the duty. 
"The German bank must remove all assets from its portfolio, where money will be used for betting on food prices," Bode said. 
"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann to hunger, suffering people or the reputation of the German bank." 
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear, however, that the CEO's just a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture. 
On Monday, the German bank announced that the head other than planned will not change in the supervisory board. 
In a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image. 
And he needs for possible losses to be little fun - after all, his successor would have to do so. 
Any other commodity facilities would be terminated 
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure high on the manager. 
So far, more than 30 000 Internet users participated in the campaign of the organization. 
Bode on Tuesday published the survey, for which the Forsa institute on 7 and 8 November has interviewed 1001 people. 
Just 11 percent think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank, which will have bet on prices for food. 
Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: every second, according to the survey would terminate all assets in which money is flowing into commodity speculation. 
43% would advise friends of such a bank, 49 percent said they consider to terminate their accounts and to switch to another institution.
