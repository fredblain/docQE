"Kalt and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court 
Behring Breivik, the man who has been two Amokläufe this summer in Norway, 77 people were killed, even in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighters. 
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people. 
"I object to the court, because you have received your mandate of organizations supporting hate ideology and because it is supported by the Multiculturalism." 
"I recognize the laws, but I am not guilty." 
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views." 
For the same reason he refused to Breivik, a mitbrachte in advance written permission at the end of the hearing to appeal to the families of his victims. 
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 more weeks remains in custody, he four weeks has no access to the media, and he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence will be closely monitored over eight weeks. 
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing. 
Some came in the hope that Breivik will be able to see in the eyes, while others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind bars and bars. 
They all took part with the aim that everything boils down to a Wegschließen. 
"I thought he is cold and inhuman," a survivor told Utoya the Norwegian broadcaster NRK. 
"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I have seen and heard the suspects." 
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and looked calm and professional during the entire hearing; he looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left again. 
Despite the Breiviks bizarre suggestion that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices. 
It may have fallen to some that the attacks of 22 July was apparently the work of an individual extremists and not a group radicals. 
But that automatically makes it easier for the pain and confusion that still feels a whole nation? 
"I wish he would look like a monster, but he does not do this," said the relatives of the victims. 
"It would be so much easier if he did."
