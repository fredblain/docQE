"Getroffen, but not defeated," Giffords in the first television interview after the attack 
Ten months after an armed man in the near distance during an election meeting in Tucson had shot at them, the republika woman was Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday evening on national television, and they sang alone on the Broadway-Stück, "the Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the return to the Congress. 
When they, along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC-Nachrichten "20/20," they struggled for words and needed help in walking. 
The programme showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet that divided their Schädel, the left side of her brain drill and its head of crosses in front to the back, has done. 
Three months ago she unexpectedly returned to the Congress, triumphantly cast their vote on the debt cutbacks. 
In her first television interview after the attack in January in which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford was smiling, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "difficult." 
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford replied (41): "It is very good." 
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" Specials, shortly before the publication of the new book by the couple was recorded: "Gabby: a story about courage and hope." 
The Special pursued Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January. 
In videos that Kelly had been recorded in the first few weeks, you can see it in the hospital bed, with bare lands shaved head and a long scarf on the cheek. 
It can only one or two fingers when her husband encouraged them. 
Months later, Giffords sits in a rolling chair, while therapists show how she carries out simple movements. 
A nodding in the head. 
A Zucken with the Germans. 
And then, her first words: "What." 
After a few days ago Giffords whispered another word: "Toast." you want to change their breakfast. 
Videos, which took place in the ABC-Show show that music is an important role in Giffords ' recovery: you can see how the members of Congress, along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna have Fun" and Tom Pettys "free Fallin" singing. " 
In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords, who every day spent two hours with therapy, that she could not remember the day of the attack. 
Her husband said that Giffords on 12 March an article from a newspaper had read about the assassination when they interrupted him, and for the first time, asked about the six people who were killed during the attack. 
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and forced medical treatment, while he was waiting for his trial. 
"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer. 
"Hart, tough, tough." 
In the course of the recovery of his wife, Kelly, told Sawyer, she said: "I was hit." 
"So, I would say: 'Gabby, you got to be defeated?'," said Kelly. 
You just got to be taken. 
And you will be, and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
