Asphalt prevents leaks from the UNAM 
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican university UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to mix more resilient to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations 
If the signs, which stem from the road surface, it would not be necessary, nearly 200 000 to repair the holes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (urban areas in the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and gave assurances that if the laying and maintenance of the Asphaltbelags proper, significantly reduced the number of bumps, or even completely avoided. 
In his presentation, "the revenues from a technical perspective," he to mark the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing, producing a similar mix the asphalt, but a larger mechanical resistance both high and low temperatures. 
Herrera Nájera said that this kind of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road surface, thereby avoiding the appearance of bumps. 
He explained that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene, and together they give the road surface his characteristic zähelastisches behavior. 
Zähelastisches behavior in the asphalt means that this high temperatures of nearly 180 °C behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees is very liquid and 50 °C almost solid, while he is fragile at very low temperatures. 
"This means that the resilience of the asphalt is not uniform on the streets, but on a day in accordance with the changing weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," led the chemical engineer. 
The researchers observed the FQ, the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible surface, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three asphalt dissidents. 
Between the upper classes is a wear layer of asphalt from small asphalt and stones. 
Every single stone of this wear layer is in asphalt. 
If the vehicles to move and forces will be created, this section provides a good balance of power on the road surface. 
"If it is modified asphalt, the forces would be even better," said the chemical engineer. 
"The wear layer," he " is being interpreted in a recent class, the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which was also in asphalt. 
As this layer in contact with the car tyres, they need a larger mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction. 
The road surface receives the most power and distributed, the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and the material from which they must be maintained. 
The weather conditions, particularly humidity and temperature fluctuations, are more important to take into account factors, above all, the water, "he said," because it greatly affects the behaviour of the wear layer. 
If the site is wet, water seeps into the class and is difficult, and this is causing a dilution of all sections of the road surface and as a result, the incidence of bumps. 
If a hole is created, "he said," will initially cover layer worn out, while the wear layer only after that will be affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that the first signs of adequate maintenance programmes should be maintained. " 
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican national research system) said that the car of another important reason for the appearance of bumps, and it is therefore crucial that the thickness of each layer of the surface is always in relation to the vehicle and it must be ensured that the avoidance of frequent bumps will be complied with these rules. 
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research, for example, on Asphaltemulsionen, which in other countries are already on the market, and with which the bumps simply and without application of high temperatures could be repaired.
