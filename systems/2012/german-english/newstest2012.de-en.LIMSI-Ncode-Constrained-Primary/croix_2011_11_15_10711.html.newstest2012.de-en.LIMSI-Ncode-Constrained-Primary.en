Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers at such a high level? 
Roughly 19% of disabled people are searching for a job. 
Today begins the 15th week of work for the disabled." 
In spite of an ambitious public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people has always been twice as high as the average value: 19% Arbeitlosigkeit 9% of the total population. 
Entmutigend? 
"No, said Ã‰ric Blanchet, director-general of the Association of Adapt" week of work for the disabled. " 
"The fifteen years of progress are substantial." 
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times as high." 
"Nevertheless, a great deal still remains to be done." 
It must be said, however, that many obstacles remain for disabled people remain before they get a job. 
More often, it affects the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average). 
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a baccalaureate, and there are only 10 000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students in higher education. 
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled people, compared with 38% of the total average. 
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult for a new job, and the "heart of the problem," Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, an association in 1992 founded the company helps recruit disabled workers. 
So much for the factual checks. 
If the underlying implication, mentalities, certainly, but slowly develop. 
In April, from the Association of IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La cite survey, which polled managers have "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled," the "overrepresented" was "of people in rolling chairs, mental or intellectual bemittelten." 
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987. 
The latter, from the 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2,6%. 
"We are now at about 3%," said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organisation, which is tasked with recovering contributions from companies that flout the law. 
The proof is that the number of "charges" plants, as well as the amount of paid sums between 2007 and 2011 has been reduced, and numbers from 59 000 to 46 000 (and 606 to 480 million euros). 
"The Act of 2005, which provides for tax increases, has created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc." 
"But this improvement is also a real awareness, especially among the large corporate groups." 
According to the ministry for work only 59% of sites between 20 and 49 employees disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees against 82%.
