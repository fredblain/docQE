Europe's finest Pools 
Leap into the blue 
Yulia Stanek 
Planschbecken Ufo-Optik, future pools in Budapest: anyone who travels through Europe can be seen blue miracle - and after a city tour or a wandering Sprudelbädern hide behind the tired legs. 
A book shows, where roofs of corrugated iron in water is the most beautiful. 
When Iris Meder over the past one and a half years on a research trip, had one thing in their luggage is not lacking: a. 
Rücklings on the water, they looked great in elaborate domes, they swam putten marble, they waited in the basin, and was meticulously renovated youth swimming halls. 
Gefiel her a bath, she took in her notiz book - all the knowledge worth details about the design and history of the building. 
More than 200 explored architectural historian Meder swimming being shed in this way - and it is now in her newly published book "Badefreuden": swimming halls in Munich, historic Badepaläste in the Black Forest, "Hardcore-Betonbauten" in the Taunus. 
Through 13 countries introduced their "travel to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": apart from Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. 
The 46 year-old German is a true Badekultur-Enthusiastin. 
In sport, it is not much in the hat, Meder says - only in the water is different. 
The annoying thing is that fans come to terms with blue Kachels and chlorine gestank, while Jogger must inhale deceptively smell of ficht forests or gaudy Vogelgezwitscher can listen in the park. 
"I have asked myself one day why being shed must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna. 
"So I began to collect beautiful bathrooms." 
Water surface doubled architecture 
Geplätscher in the basin and ethereal sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great, because we are using all the senses, Meder. 
And if the builders of trouble swimming halls can be a real Augenschmaus: "Instead of a floor in bathrooms a water surface." 
"It is transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building." 
All doubled optical: high vaults, colorful Kachels, bretter. 
The small forma band "Badefreuden" gives 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness havens - but, above all, desire for a leap into the blue. 
Remarkable specimens discovered the Pool-Sammlerin Meder in their research in Hungary. 
In addition, sumptuous Heilbads such as the 100 years old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, they found a nitrate containing water in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a Thermalbad, whose basin is filled with alkalihaltigem water and are located in a flaschenförmigen building (Városi Termálfürdö Jászberény). 
Spectacular prospects, however, offer many heated Freibads in Switzerland and Austria: while the Zurich Dachbad the whole city has in mind can be in a bad external pool in St Anton to look at the snow cover of an - and, in the Dampfbad there is a window from which you can monitor the activities of the Ski-Piste. 
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design beach visitors expected in length: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo landed in the Alps. 
From three upwards open Schales dampft in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of the Ötztals out in the sky. 
Alhambra in the Black Forest 
It is not in any swimming pool, the Pool-Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose. 
Many termination after sulphur smell in Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much for fuel oil, which we believe is unlikely to have landed in a Gesundheitsbad. 
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen water, which is almost black and whose of silt a stain on the skin, as soon as you slip into the basin - a wellness special. 
At one location was Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites, however, also disappointed: when it freed and being in Czech Bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit, they found a cordoned off area. 
The 1902 by architect Duan Jurkovic bath has now been closed. 
When Meder a glance through the verwittert windows of the rot-weiß-gelben Jugendstil-Gebäudes, saw them as weeds between the open places. 
The decline has countered, however, in a beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais hot springs at Bad Wildbad. 
Three Bauphasen, this bath is already behind; it can detect not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurisch Hall in Alhambra-Stil, which was added to 1900. 
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais hot springs pool kennerin Lieblingsbad Iris Meder - and not just because they originally came from the Black Forest. 
"It is quite an achievement, so different to merge Baustils into a fine unit," Meder said. 
With such a palace, the Tauchgang in the spa pool is apparently only incidental.
