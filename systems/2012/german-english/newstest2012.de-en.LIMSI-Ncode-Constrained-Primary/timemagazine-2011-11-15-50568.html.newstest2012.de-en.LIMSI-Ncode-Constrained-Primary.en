Seven lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which this week has been shown in a theatre 
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared some him with Henry Ford and the engineering wizard as a great modern inventor. 
What Apple fans, but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs interview in this week's special vorführungs film has been dusted off on the major markets, is how much of this creative business processes and workflows. 
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, the zealous Diagrams bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from "a disease of the mind," "a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product." 
In 1995, Bob Cringely, the TV series "triumph of the idiots" about the departure of staff Computers, and he served longer than an hour with jobs in which they are a rare, detailed discussions. 
At this stage than 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he has worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet. 
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in professional idiot, he says that the copy of the interview was missing in the delivery. 
It was only after jobs death, discovering a complete VHS-Kopie in the garage of the director. 
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68 minutes film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview," this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark-Theater. 
For someone who is known for his extensive interviews, jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies. 
And incredibly thoughtful. 
In the course of the interview is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds, clearly weighing his ideas and is striving for accuracy. 
There are also moments in which jobs ' perfect day comes when he seemingly impatient responded to Cringelys questions and anschubst, faster on issues or adverse actions of greater importance. 
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included the lost interview somehow seems eerily prescient when jobs evaluated what other companies his opinion is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer. 
It is one thing, posthumous awards for career jobs, but jobs are to be seen as the eager dreamers on the leap of grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring. 
He has a vision of how things could and should. 
Shortly after he had done everything he pulled off and made it. 
A quick look at seven noteworthy sequences of lost interviews: 
As he learned to run a business: 
"During the entire years in business, I always ask: 'Why do you go?' and the answer always is:" oh, it is made easy. " 
No one knows why he does what he does, but no one really thinks carefully about things. 
I have noticed that. 
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple. 
Struck, as costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs," which were estimated at a mere suspicion and then adapted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the cost of business could be down to the smallest. 
As the Pope was veralbert: 
Jobs have been told of the "Blue Box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which to creep into the telephone company and TV talks could result in vain. 
The device has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm, as the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious. 
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a telephone to make a phone call and then from an AT & T-Netzwerk in another, while so many satellites as possible. 
"We sent half a dozen times around the globe, and if you grölte into the phone, it came a minute later on the telephone next door," kichernd told Jobs. 
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure on the whole world can control." 
We both, we did not know much, but we have been able to build this small thing that can control a gigantic thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without them Apple would be. 
Jobs have been told by a glorious stroke, Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they are in the middle of the night via the Blue Box ringing in the Vatican, and wanted to talk with the Pope, while they are so good they were Henry Kissinger. 
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone. 
As he verliebte in technology (and called unprepared Bill Hewlett): 
In the age of 12 years ago, when he looked for spare parts to build a radio meters, he searched Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him. 
Shortly after her 20 minutes telephone call received jobs for the summer a Hewlett-Packard Teilzeitjob. 
"This has had a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company that I had seen in the old age, and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its staff." 
Later jobs was one of the HP-Mitarbeiter, the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he was "the first Desktop-Computer ever saw." 
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen and I verliebte myself in him. 
I would like to HP as a teenager climb and hang on to this machine and programmes to write for them. 
How innovation improves: 
On several occasions in the interview, Jobs speaks about how spontaneous to invent new products. 
Early in his career, when he einbaute a few Platinen, he was asked by a customer to assemble them the whole computer. 
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had both the assembly processes and the extradition of the finished equipment. 
Later, when Apple reminds him of the problems in the development of a computer mouse: 
"I remember resounding arguments... you screamed that it would take five years to build a mouse, which would cost 300 Dollar] and I went out and found a manufacturer." 
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, which we are building for 15. Dollar This was incredibly credible. 
More than large companies: 
Long before Apple revival, saw the jobs on which so many industrial giants came in with their visions and lost control of their shares. 
"Let us say that you are working for IBM or Xerox, so you make a better Kopierer or printer, and na?" 
They have the monopoly on stock, so the company is no longer successful. 
Sales and marketing make it successful, in other words, there are such people, which ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are being squeezed out of the decisionmaking process. 
The production wizard, which has led to the monopoly enjoyed by the people who have no idea about good versus bad products, eradicated - handicraft art. 
This is what happened to Xerox... 
Xerox would have been able to have the entire computer industry. 
It would have been 10 times greater that Microsoft would be in the 1990s... 
They have caught the defeat of the victory. 
Innovation as an art form: 
"There is plenty of craft between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, they change and grow." 
You learn a lot about his skill. 
You need votes, certain things you can do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories. 
It has 5 000 objects to see these concepts, and bring them all together.... 
Ultimately, it boils down to the taste, it is tantamount to saying that an attempt is being made, with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to put these things together, which makes it possible. 
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. 
We have always been shameless in the theft of grand ideas. 
Part of what Macintosh was wonderful was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world. 
Would it not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
