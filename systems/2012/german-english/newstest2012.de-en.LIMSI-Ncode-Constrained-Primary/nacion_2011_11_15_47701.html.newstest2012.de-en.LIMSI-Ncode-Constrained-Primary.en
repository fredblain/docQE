"To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true." 
In an exclusive interview with Viva says the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the band is ready for the next Sunday in the national stadium to give one of their best concerts. 
More than 20 years they have been expected, but the band assured us that it is a dream come true for them when they play in Costa Rica. 
That assured the Bassist and Mitgründer of the group, Jeff Ament, the Viva Brazil last week gave an exclusive interview. 
The band is located in the South American part of their Tournee to celebrate their 20th anniversary, and on Sunday, 20, making its only stop in Central America. 
On this day they enter the national stadium from 7.30pm, along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las robe rtas from Costa Rica. 
You read an excerpt from the interview, the full transcript to be found in the online edition of La Nación. 
For your Costa Rican fans realised a dream when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: ' You know what this means for your fans? 
To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us. 
This is just the second time that we in South and Central America, and until now it has been great. 
I am only once on holiday in Costa Rica, but it is a beautiful country, that we will stay a few days ago. 
It is exciting for us to get our music there. 
I ask you this, because the fans of the band are completely; you can see the days before the concert the closest possible. 
What do you say to your enthusiastic fans? 
Thank you, all these years to be on our side. 
We have spent nearly 21 years until we have come to Costa Rica, and I am grateful to have waited so long and we regret to have taken so long before we came here. 
Some people are even of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year. 
Übt not a bit of pressure from your visit? 
Some of the greatest shows that we have in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks. 
We have a couple of big shows played in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we are prepared for this concert have made in Costa Rica. 
Indeed, we have the desire to play there. 
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle, and for that Costa Rica is among the best countries in the world. 
How did your Costa Rica and befriended the surfing its waves? 
Many of our friends are, and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable. 
My friends are always surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico are excellent places for surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned from it. 
With a glance at the Tournee you have offered shows with many songs. 
What plans they have for the event in Costa Rica? 
Since we have never played, we have no borders. 
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs, and we want to see a few tunes created from each album and our fans offer a good and varied repertoire. 
Your your repertoire is never repeated. 
Why? 
I think this is partly because we have nine Platten and more than 120 songs can play, and everyone likes a different song, so that the decision, which we will play against each other, is not easy. 
If we have two or three Songs, which we have no longer have played into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us, because they remember the reasons why we have taken this Song's. They might otherwise be forgotten. 
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think for the audience. 
This Tournee is celebrating its two-decade history. 
If you look, it is hard to believe in your success? 
Yes, total. 
Firstly, I believe that none of us has imagined to play once in a great rock band, and more than 20 years, and it looks like a dream. 
We also continue to have this blessing and find it wonderful to be able to make music together. 
We love us and are thrilled to bring music. 
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world, which we have always wanted to visit again. 
Things could not be better. 
What does it mean for you, actively participated in the birth of the Grunge? 
It has always been an honour to join this group of large volumes. 
We are good with the people of sound garden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friendly. 
It is surprising and very unusual, when a movement emerges from a group of friends. 
Every now and again a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual for five or ten groups at the same time come from the same city. 
We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the Seattle group. 
Sometimes we still play together. 
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound garden on their Tournee. We look forward to them all is still to be friendly and there is a credit to us, part of this is going to be Seattle sounds. 
It is also very unusual for a band like yours so long ago, together with the same musicians. 
Yes, four of us play for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us from 13 years ago, and that alone is a lot more time than many bands survive. 
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive, and we also care about each other. 
We are all close friend and musical paths have opened each individual the freedom to experiment. 
One familiar with the other and its music, but it could not be better. 
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, but on the other hand, konntet her thanks to your success always do what you wanted a Yugoslav. 
How is their balance? 
The way we have grown, it has become easier to find a balance. 
We are certainly not too often to be Tournee, because it is too easy, this game with huge numbers of people who love your music. 
As long as we keep in mind that people have come because of the music reminds you that you have the music and what they created, must be careful not to be a famous rock stars, and this has never been interested. 
What are the memories you have in your other project Mother Love Bone? 
I think we have very good Song's written and it was great at the beginning. 
We were three years of a gang which until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had issued a record. 
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD), the band returned with us, our friends, and when I hear a song or photographs can see, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he made me laugh, but it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and about music and football and many other issues. 
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him. 
The domestic band Las robe rtas for the opening of the show in Costa Rica. 
Is it true that she is familiar with their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band have therefore chosen for the opening? 
Yes, the production sent us videos from various groups and the band did best, and that is why we are curious to see what robe rtas can offer live. This is exciting. 
Why does the text of Yellow Ledbetter always when you play live? 
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea. 
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks. 
Who you got to be affected as Bassist? 
So many + 
Among the first to include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... 
There are so many that I have the whole afternoon on the Bassists, which I could talk about. 
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the Grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad? 
I think we all feel we are not very connected with the word Grunge. 
When I think about it, I think the tapes, which I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney, sound garden, nirvana and all the others who were at the same time, if they are still important today, I find it wonderful, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and band like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before. 
Initially, their music was darker, it is now more positive. 
Why? 
This is interesting, because I believe there are a few tunes created on the new album, which might seem a bit frivolous, but there are also other songs such as The End or just Breathe, which are classified as very dark Song's, even though they have something positive. 
On both, I had the tears when I heard how Ed she played, and it is very dark Song's. 
I believe that if you are older, and something drastic has happened in your life - for example, if a family member or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music, and these two Song's embody the clear for me. 
But I am also of the opinion that we have to be a happy man and can still make dark music.
