Troops feel more compassion than respect 
The event was a Wall Street gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City. 
Kid Rock sang a Ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss. 
In a word collected hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him. 
The amount in black Smoking stood up and applauded. 
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organised the donation campaign in the spring. 
A senior military officer at the gala, which, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen has been observed, saw the role of the troops in a different way. 
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an Email. 
I am sure that the organizers have good intentions. 
I know that. 
But there was no respect, not really, but it was compassion. 
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public. 
The troops are to be commended for their victims. 
But the praise has its price, members say. 
The public is increasingly behaving as if their people in uniform suffering. 
"We were not victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan. 
"But apparently is the only way of supporting those who are to put ourselves in the unfortunate souls." 
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who are not ungrateful or in dispute with the public, which they want to appear. 
They also have recognized that the anger, the returning troops in the last few years of the Vietnam War, was far worse. 
As a result talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans. 
After his two sons have returned from battles with the navy, warned Colonel ex-army Mark Cancian that people outside the military world their service could be seen from two different perspectives. 
Some people would consider with a sense of awe, as rebels were defeated and traveled to exotic places. 
Others would wonder whether an "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface," says Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and a senior government posts after his return to Washington. 
During his job search, he said he felt that some of the interviewer erfragten subtle, whether he was the same after his return from the struggle to cope with the pressure of a demanding job in Washington. 
"If you speak about your service, you must keep the negative impressions about it," says Cancian his sons. 
The lack of ease of the military is rooted partly in Americans' lack of interest in the war. 
Services on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is rarely singled out as praise. 
"We as a nation do not appreciate military heroism more so, as it was absolutely normal in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded the US forces in Afghanistan. 
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely due to the suffering of a service member. 
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost them, or for the severity of their injuries.
