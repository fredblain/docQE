21er house in Vienna 
The moved pavilion 
Ingeborg Wiensowski 
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy ending: the Austrian World exhibition pavilion must present in Brussels in 1958, prices, was in Vienna for the museum, was empty and verkam. 
Now he is being reopened as an exhibition house. 
If dreams of modern postwar architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new materials for the faith in technological progress are typical, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Charles Schwanzer of the Brussels World Expo is a good and famous example in 1958. 
Schwanzers pavilion at the Eurovision Song Contest Architecture for his easy and steel glass design. 
The building is seen as a milestone to date of contemporary architecture. 
He made the architect so well known that at the next World Expo in Austria pavilion was built. 
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he was in 1973, after all, internationally famous. 
His temporary Ausstellungsbau planned pavilion at the World Expo in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South station converted and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20s home" has been called it. 
This was the building but neither physical and technical as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate. 
Nevertheless, it has been used so long before contemporary art was a new house in Vienna. 
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more. 
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art. 
On Tuesday night, the museum opened Belvedere, which includes the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect. 
The new start Agnes Husslein-Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere. 
Husslein-Arco completed his Ph.D. art historian with remarkable career, among other things, in the youth as a Eiskunstläufererin, then with Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the museum of modern Salzburg, strongly defended the reconstruction with politicians and Denkmalschützern, they get public funding and private sponsorship money and fixed use. 
Besides contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba will be issued by the eponymous foundation, a café and there should be a bookshop, and a spacious house had to be built. 
Strict supervision, small budget 
The execution was the ideal person Krischanitz. 
It is not just because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive converted and enlarged and had won the competition, but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him an "enormously important place" was where he "almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions. 
He knew the Ur-Entwurf, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung generosity and easily lost. 
In the current restructuring, there have been far greater problems: the building was "a schleuder energy," Krischanitz says. 
The profils windows were replaced outside glass fibre verstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof is replaced by special security glass. 
Kältebrücken-Stahlträger are reinforced or replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been cleaned up. 
Two shells made room for the new use, a abgesenkter trench between home and road for the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still slightly Schwanzer-Pavillon. 
The original exterior doors are left, the house is removed in the old rotbraun Rostschutz-Farbton. 
And the cinema is even more exactly as it was before. 
And this is all under strict supervision of the authority and with a small budget. 
"We often had to find a material that is good and cheap, and the Denkmalschutzamt did," Krischanitz says, and points to a raw soil should go. 
Despite all the constraints, problems and repairing the buildings remained flexible and easy. 
It would have been difficult with the pavilion, "the usual from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte." 
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "create a proper awareness." 
In this case, the 21er house but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: if the Swiss garden is completely new planned "main station home," with offices and homes. 
And maybe another stroke will occur: the 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz-Bau, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and, as we hear, they have been negotiating with the city a good location in the Swiss garden.
