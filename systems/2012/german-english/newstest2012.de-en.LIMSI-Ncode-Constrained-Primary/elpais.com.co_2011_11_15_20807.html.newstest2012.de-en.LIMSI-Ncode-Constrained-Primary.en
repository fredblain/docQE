What was missing from the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia? 
Analysis of the factors that played that Melina Ramírez Serna was the crown of Miss Colombia. 
El Valle gets its 14th title. 
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia. 
This time had to Melina Ramírez Serna content to stand on the podium, a silver head and the band, which they regard as the new Miss Colombia to flaunt. 
This night result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico crown and the cedar, the Department is already at 14 and Melina is linked to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which the Crown had almost been kept in the hands, are among the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). 
The big question many are asking today is: what was missing? 
The result is in line with the decline of a great favorite in any exhibition had shown that they had anything new to be Miss Colombia, but it was not for nothing that the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue, titles, including the königins beauty Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home. 
The first factor, which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the panel to appoint the first Miss, is that the answer to the question, "what book has most influenced you and why?" of Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta aria Leamos, had not convinced. 
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner: 
"I read a lot, I think pretty much of the literature, I think it is a way to be civilised, in the end, I believe that the book, which for most shaped my childhood, 'the little prince' is a very profound book. 
At the moment I read 'guilt and expiation within'; it is a book of universal culture, which we should all read, but I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, which says 'passions'. 
One answer, which was met with little love, firstly because of the term 'civilised' and, secondly, because it had no concrete explanation of how each of her book had affected them. 
But after the ceremony, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is, it happens, what must be done. 
And for all the people: please read a little bit of 'the little prince'; it is a great book. 
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is charred. 
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was the special, all Beifälle einheimste and had all prices in the runup to Easter gastronomy competition, popular vote on the best handgeschneiderte Kostüm and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealously guarding the Queen stresste, who could not shine on the stage." 
And it noted that in its first presentation wear swimsuits on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the krönung ceremony. 
Although it appeared in both safe, but it lacked the strength and the momentum of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed. 
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "as en casa" on the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the highest prices during the competition, but will not be queen." 
It also came to the end of the press - a mistake. 
Another hypothesis is that Valle Jurie about their interest in social work was not convincing, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest. 
There is a reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who stood up for the social affairs of their country. 
"The beauty of a Miss Colombia alone is not enough; we must look beyond the physical and focus on the social perception that they participate in the competition had been involved in projects," she said. 
There is also speculation that Valle with their Derriere and fibrosis defects found her in the stomach area, has said that he had sinned, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for "natural beauty" with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work. 
The coach of a Queen, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina was not the best body, that there would be better, "but the problem with the fibrosis in the belly, which for me to be honest, it was hard to say, put their numbers on the last day." 
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine, the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgery she had undergone. 
"The operations are lines, but Valle did not know how they do it right. 
Her body has never been her strong side, and she had to pay for this post." 
As a result of this prize, which is the first time will be awarded by the national beauty contest was conceived after the appearance in a grim prediction, which should be true in the night, and it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize was given to them not to come into the enjoyment of the crown. 
No matter whether it is true or not, in fact, that Melina today assumes its domination of the year, not as Queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the possibility of the appointment of the Colombian national beauty contest in one of the international competitions. 
However, it is one of a Queen, which, despite its overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, the crown was lost in history.
