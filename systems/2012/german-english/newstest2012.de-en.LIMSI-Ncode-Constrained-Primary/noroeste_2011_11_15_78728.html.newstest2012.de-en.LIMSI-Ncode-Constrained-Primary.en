The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN), the constitutional claims, which the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies were lodged against the presidential decree, and the switch from analogue to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, because of a lack of eight votes are needed for the anfechtung legislation. 
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that the President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he decree-law with the details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television.

These issues, she said, "were the actions of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state a group of characteristics, the Constitution in the hands of the central government." 
It reminded that many countries around the world have already carried out the digital conversion, and the government, even though they have highly specialised facilities at their disposal.
