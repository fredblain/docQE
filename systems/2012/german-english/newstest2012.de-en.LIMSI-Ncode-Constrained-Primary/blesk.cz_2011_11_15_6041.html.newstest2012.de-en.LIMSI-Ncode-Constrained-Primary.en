Darina Rychtáová on their meeting: 
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I do not want him more! 
Darina Rychtáová (53) says - now is closure. 
After her husband, Josef Rychtá (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartoová (45) whose lover was Darina remained hopeful that Josef springs from his rosy dream and come home. 
But it is now finally ended with the patience and for the further life she has set clear rules. 
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtáová. 
When Darina Rychtáová singer I. Bartoová had taken refuge in her own house, she would probably not even in my dream, like that with her husband. 
When Iveta at their urging, after 30 days and went back to íany, Joseph went with the same. 
Indeed, he confessed publicly that they love. 
By the time Darina resignierte, indeed, it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her relinquishing man - but she finally gave him the passport. 
Rychytá is no matter with whom his wife is sleeping 
If Rychtá Iveta Bartoová should leave in future, then he will certainly not be welcomed. 
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to take his days in our common home, then I will not chase him." 
"It is not, however, than to be loved, lost its way old mule, but as a person, which I do have some ties," Ms. Rychtáová betrayed; but they also said that she had already been emotional for him and is solely on mutual asceticism. 
The fact that he Darina the back door was locked, Josef has so far with dignity. 
"I respect the decision of my wife." 
"I stand together with Iveta, nothing has changed." 
"My wife wants a Papier-Ehe and I respect that." 
"The company is going further, I am concerned about the repairs, the garden, I am shopping." 
"By Darina I am quite normal, only the bed we do not share," said J. Rychtá (the story) Blesk. 
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he would not prevent them. 
"We do not sleep with each other, so I don't care whether she has a friend or who it is. 
It is clear that this is my fault, I am in love with Iveta and therefore I assume any responsibility.
