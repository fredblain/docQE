The schnurrbärtig plumber is breaking with "Super Mario 3D country," the third dimension 
Super Mario has worked tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now never in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D country," he fights for the love of the girl in Stereo-Technologie. 
The game, which this month all the world is coming to the shop counter, was the beginning of the characteristics of the portable Konsole Nintende 3DS three-dimensional played without a special lens. 
"Mario is the figure who must say how the Stereoskopie works without glasses," he told Omar Alvarez, who is responsible for the Nintendo specialised press in Spain during the presentation of the video game in Madrid. 
Álvarez said, "Super Mario 3D country" was "the first video game from Nintendo, which from the outset has been developed for this Konsole ', because until now have been success stories such as" Star Fox 64 3D "or" Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D " adaptations of existing titles. 
The spokesman for Nintendo stressed that, even though it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D" is an "affordable" video game, which will permit a quick, fluid game. 
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D" two games in one: the first part is "easy" to obtain the less geschckten users. 
Then the experts on different levels, which are becoming more and more difficult, a "second round." 
It also allows users in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only the depth of the action. In order to overcome the obstacles, without falling victim to the "optical effects," however, must always be played three-dimensional. 
This excursion Super Marios in the three-dimensional world will also mean the return of the figure to a portable Konsole, which is no longer the case since 2005. 
In this video game Nintendo zwinkert fans of the saga, and repeated the recipe for success in the past: the schnurrbärtig plumber must overcome with dangers peppered platforms in order to liberate the Princess Peach. 
However, the players on news of the movements, the environment, the stepping and the enemies - and a "spielbar" Luigi.
