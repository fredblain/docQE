Park or mountain? 
The architects are apart from the disputes over the fees agreed with the call for tenders. 
The urban tender on 16 windows opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona. 
In the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the now lost Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the administration published its Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola. 
The brochure described the mountain as a vast park in Barcelona city. 
He was even in figures from the Central Park in New York. 
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many back to the upper limit of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is among the few who are not spreading in North and South, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea). 
The Collserolas classification as a natural park is playing with this idea. 
When the Image is now no longer the Central Park, but yellow stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs. 
So far, it was when the city in September, a giant, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access points to Collserola. 
No doubt it is a gateway to the concept of a park. 
Either that, or someone has to make windows in the country. 
The question is: Collserola, park or mountain? 
The tender is not only from the organizational perspective, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona. 
It is almost a rekurrentes issue on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste, who meet in the lift. 
And it is precisely this fact provides the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors, who have applied to the project. 
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate. 
For Roldán "it is necessary," after the attack on the coast on the "front of the mountains," as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, green apples, has not been resolved. 
"It should be based on the principle that is Barcelona's biggest park is the beach. 
Among other things, because it is accessible. 
Collserola is more complex, "the architect, for which the title" windows of Collserola "an" intellectual case ": it must not be" as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas in which needs to be done. " 
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that "a number of risks." 
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty, the creation of a public space today" after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of the forum "swan song." 
The first fear is his own limits on what can be built. 
"Something always means to determine the next step," i.e. to exceed it. 
"We need to rethink urban planning instruments, because the present (with reference to the plan, General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster." 
Modol, who is closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, the valle sana direction, "can be understood as a park in Barcelona direction," and for purely topographical reasons. 
Modol reminds us that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola, which is not "fallen on deaf ears," even though the city council is grateful that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment." 
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, even though he "doubts" whether this technical profile created multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says), ' we architects should only be a tool. " 
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because the bidding conditions lacks a global view of Collserola: "It has been put out to tender in cross-section of 16 competitions," he says, "on the axis gebirge, but there is no längs perspective, which considers the territory in its entirety." 
This has resulted in his case, at least, that he participated in the 16 competitions. 
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gateway through which the architect of the clash. 
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length as a soft transition between urban and green zones.
