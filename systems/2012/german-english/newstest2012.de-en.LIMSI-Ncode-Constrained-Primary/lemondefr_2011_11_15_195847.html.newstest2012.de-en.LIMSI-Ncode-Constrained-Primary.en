What represents the fraud in health care coverage? 
After the family benefits UMP and government health reports. 
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday, 15 November arrive in Bordeaux to visit a family aid fund and a speech about it - has already been in place since 2007, the recurring theme of the fight against social fraud, as well as to raise economic dependence on the state. 
In order to accompany this attack, which comes from the desire to take the economy in an acid test, on the other hand, however, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee health reports. 
The first haushaltswirtschaftlichem goal: the government is aimed at the introduction of a fourth Karenztag before taking a health care speech to workers in the private sector. 
In plain language this means that a sick worker without the approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of his monthly income. 
One measure, which, according to the newspaper "Les Echos," sparking anger threatens, however, would help to bring 280 million euros. 
And with a different measure more symbolic nature: the state officials to grant a unvergüteten Karenztag in sickness (so far there is for them, in Gegensatze on the three days of waiting in the private sector, no waiting period). 
Meanwhile, these issues are in the discussion also cranked up the majority of new issues, and this time will be aimed at the abuses associated with working absenz. 
"Checks will be much more important, and they are also rückzuvergüten, if this is required," warned Javier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the broadcaster RTL. 
As in other cases, the effects of this reporting about the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of health information is a little unproportioniert. 
This is, in fact, has already been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensive operations, which have borne the most fruit. 
The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe. 
However, Verweilen first with the nationwide figures. 
According to the national health insurance fund CNAM, in 2006, more than EUR 237 million abfindungen paid. 
According to the research and Documentation Institute of the health care system, the daily abfindungen in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros 5% of health spending. 
This figure fell 46% on maternity leave, as well as accidents and 54% on holidays, which means EUR 6.2 billion. 
And, therefore, 2,5% of health spending. 
In 2010, the French compared with the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma consultation group averaged just 14.5 days allowed. 
An average, masks some differences: a different monster in 2007, the website for career planning, has been published, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French workers claimed to have taken a single Krankentag. 
Another study covered by health insurance is clear that 37% of health coverage in 2010 of shorter duration than were 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%. 
Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend not more than anywhere else on incapacity. 
One in 2010 by two researchers from the French national Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) conducted long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenz ratio (the reduction or otherwise justified) oszillierte, and in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. 
The fraud in health coverage represents a very small proportion in terms of undeclared work. 
With regard to the fraud only a weak level will be achieved here. 
The legislation since 2002 is that there are systmatische controls on health coverage exceeding 45 days. 
In 2008, the CNAM (public universities for education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million inspections found that 13% of the 285 000 of the short-term health coverage, which means in 37 050 cases, "unjustified or too long." 
When it comes to the systematic monitoring of patients to speak "cases of more than 45 days duration was 11%, from 1.2 million in" unangepaßt or unjustified " cases, which means 132 000. 
Overall, therefore, makes this 169 000 'unjustified' cases to several millions of workers who have been in force. 
One paragraph, which is only a small scale compared with, for example, those who represented the black economy. 
According to the UMP-Abgeordneten Dominique Tian, author of a report published in July on this issue, it is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax cuts per year, i.e. more than the total cost of day-to-day expenses, and thus far more than the Defraudation in the latter.
