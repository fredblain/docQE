The walls have eyes: how do you watch researchers on Facebook 
Before he become the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik only one of many boys, their anti-einwanderungs online programs. 
On Monday, Breivik, who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public hearing before the court. 
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has much time until his attack on its computers and with some of the millions of gechattet by nationalists, the far-right groups on behalf of social support networks. 
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out about these people. 
But how will they be? 
This is easy - you just need to log on Facebook. 
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe. 
Were books hiding place of personal data is so enzyklop√§disch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the promotional tool of their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific accuracy - as do retailers for years. 
Bartletts team found half a million supporters of extreme-right groups throughout Europe and then visierte them with Adds, but instead with a new band or a new dieting product Adds users invited to a survey in which, according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment has been asked for their own future. 
Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10 000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties to consult in 11 European countries - without that they had to leave their offices. 
"It is a fairly new research method," Bartlett says. 
Some of the results come as no surprise; online promoters of extreme-right groups are mostly young, male and resent immigration. 
But in a way surprising meanings are "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens." 
DEMOs work is just one example, as Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists. 
Factories, medical researchers and political scientists use to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "Likes" texting and aktualisierungen status. 
With more than 800 million active users, on average three to add content per day, were books generated "data supernova explosion," a research boom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side of the title in the last five years to almost 800% increase. 
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you could study people from this side, which is usually not met with his Clipboard on the street. 
"If you had previously tried to consult the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them." 
"They first had to inform the party and they should never have been admitted," Bartlett says. 
"Facebook is all away - you go directly to them." 
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems. 
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge on Facebook, significantly more prone to drink than students who remained silent on this issue. 
Moreno suggests that same students, for example housing adviser, monitor and help a student if they postet too many aktualisierungen. 
"You cannot solve a problem if you have not seen it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and head of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post. 
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children, who would not have been found in a different way." 
Facebook also constantly zapft the data of its own people. 
The data team has statistics on the status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the midterm elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (although data have been used primarily on the Facebook access only - champions digital freedom have known for a long time that their large data rich source for others should make available for research purposes. 
But users of Facebook know that they watched the side, whether or not they want it, with a friend, the thousands of miles away, Scrabble to play the part of the losses in their own personal data. 
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey of which they still do not even know anything? 
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines, such as their offline data collected online, everything is permitted. 
"I do not believe that many users have even thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab, a study from the year 2006, in which he looked side of students on Facebook. 
"As far as they are concerned, it was only about them and their friends." 
Then there is the question of the methodology. 
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research is absolutely honest. 
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims made in a user profile, and in speeches are true. 
"What you say on Facebook and what you make outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," Selwyn says. 
That is why Selwyn thinks, despite his years as technology researchers, that a Clipboard and a pen still are the best research tools, anyone can use. 
"There is no substitute for it to go into the real world and to speak with real people," he says. 
"Social research must be concerned about the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline."
