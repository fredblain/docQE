The worst female vices: what is it with you? 
If you are calling on the men to name some typical female vices, they invariably shake some promptly from the sleeves. 
Love women, you see in the following lines, in which we review a couple of Unsittes men wallen the blood in the cold? 
Shopping addiction 
If her husband to be shopping addicts? 
Do you at least buy a weekly? 
Do you like to shop and to be a little more? 
Then it is probably true in your case a weakness. 
Some women are at least aware and are trying to do their shopping to keep under control. 
But hand on heart, the woman is already on the lookout for a good clothes from a clothes shop on bummeln, and not all the same (in every possible colour kombinations) in the booth to try? 
Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women, it is often the pure hell for the men. 
How many times they have already told her husband - a man you would rather be outside... 
Constant dissatisfaction 
"I am not too fat?" 
"I would have to be reduced at least five kilos - I should start to go jogging or Gymnastik?" 
"I give you Gefalle?" 
If they somehow know? 
Yes? 
Then you probably belong to the women who are obsessed with how they look like. 
This is not a long time ago that you should leave, but many men have an allergic reaction when their wife whinges constantly about their appearance. 
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, the women are always unvertr√§glicher. 
Order and cleanliness in the first place 
It is a fight against windmills. 
Windows, clean sweep Fliesen and dust, the scheuern - and this at least twice in the week. 
Schimpfen you with their partner because he once again with dirty shoes trample on the clean open places, you are chastising children, because it is already a dirty gescheuerte washing basin and because the glass door in the living room cabinet has been again fingerprints, but where the Polier makes so much effort? 
If you are under this kind of "Devianz," then you should know that we should not exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life does not stand in the first place. 
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can also end up mutual relations and, above all, harm the calm in the family. 
Sticheln 
"Dirty Turnhoses." 
"Do you want the old socks really attract tomorrow?" 
"A wet towel is not simply on the floor." 
If your partner is subjected to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that he brings to the Palme. 
It is not a bad thing, but they want all his order. 
If they knew the men, then women might not need so much to meckern. 
Gossip and novelty 
Some women like to applaud and trat as getuschelt or even slandered behind the backs or forge alliances. 
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to panting through such issues, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why. 
I think each of us has a little harmless gossip and novelty at the camp. 
Hand on heart - which is probably all women of their own. 
But this is not to be confused with klatscht seekers gross calibre, whom nothing and no one is sacred, which I think everyone in their environment, and particularly for women's collectives have pose a significant risk.
