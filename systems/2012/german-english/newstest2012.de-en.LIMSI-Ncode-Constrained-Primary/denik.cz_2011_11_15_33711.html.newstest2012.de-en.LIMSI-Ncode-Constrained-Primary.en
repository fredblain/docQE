Development of the rice prices since 1989 
Until 1989, the SSR only five authorized state agencies: edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. 
The travel agents at the time, above all, sold only travel in the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West at that time were chosen. 
And so, Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea), to the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary to the Balaton. 
One exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it also was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia then proposed a pro-Western course, and that is why the trips to Yugoslavia have been severely restricted. 
A great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (Tschechoslowakes) was allowed in the framework of the socialist countries to travel freely. 
If a citizen of the SSR individually for Poland, for example, or even in the Soviet Union wanted to travel, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, because otherwise, individual travel was not possible. 
Even then, the travel agencies offered trips to the West, but huge queues had to accept or even in sleeping bags to be careful before the travel office, or at least "good friend" in the travel office. 
Even so, the issue has not gone for a long time. 
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all. 
The Czechoslovak currency was not a free umtauschbare currency without foreign exchange commitment, so it would have been impossible to make the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West. 
The majority of Czechs spent their holidays at home, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dachas - a habit that lasted until now. 
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot. 
While until 1989, a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million last year on their foreign holidays in countries of the world. 
An enormous paradox today is no longer conscious at all is the fact that the currently most popular tourist destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all, because it is part of the former Yugoslavia. 
Right from the beginning of the 1990s of the last century to the foreign exchange requirement was lifted into the neighbouring Western European countries, which is a huge wave of short visit to Vienna in Austria and Germany. 
The Tschechoslowakes have for a long time from their trips to the West simply cannot get enough, everyone wanted at least a few days ago. 
For example, the Czech tourists slept on trips to Paris in a tent in the park, because who would have the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension. 
A typical feature on foreign travel of Czechs was a canned beer and sausage, etc., loaded baggage. 
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally free to buy the Western currency. 
Our living standards and the average salary rose to 1997, einm√ºndete in another important moment. 
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agents began regularly in 1997, preparing to travel by charter flights, which makes the air travel, thanks to the ability to negotiate quantity rabatte, compared to the past verbilligten unbelievable. 
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs, except the United States, foreign currency transactions with all the advanced countries in the world, which travel more easily. 
Another interesting moment in the history of the "velvet" tourist traffic in the year 2000, when, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country after Thailand. 
Since then, every year to fly direct charter planes with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations. 
The Tsd 100 Czechs travel each year in exotic countries. 
Another important moment in the era that our "revolutionary" development marked came in 2008. 
On 17 November 2008, the US visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country brutalized for daring definitely among the advanced countries in the world. 
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in its history for a single holiday trip, including the cost of the holiday more than CZK 15 Tsd per capita.
