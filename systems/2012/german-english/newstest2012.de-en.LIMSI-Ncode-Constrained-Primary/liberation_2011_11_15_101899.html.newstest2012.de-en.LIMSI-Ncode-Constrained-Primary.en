Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy? 
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many corners - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of the figures derived from politics, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had calls itself. 
More recently, the harassment directed against foreign students was marked by the authorities' side, the weekly schaus, the interior minister had in passing (see liberation from 23 May) announced that France "no talent, Maurer or waiters from abroad." 
But this policy was only rarely from the economic point of view. 
Over this issue, there is a broad consensus between right and left. 
From the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900 people, including more than 2 million immigrierte workers, will pose no problem for a country," from left side by Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990, France "could not accept the overall poverty in the world." 
The only difference is the level of generosity 
The fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers, in 2005, both from the right and the left. 
From both sides, the immigrants as a burden on the economy and the French society. 
The only difference is the degree of generosity towards the immigrants who are willing to admit. 
Francois Hollande is restricted in his programme to cliché, partnership development, it will allow us to solve "migratory problems." 
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can possibly have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly. 
As the economists Ian Goldin and Mr. Cameron in a recent note, which summarises the latest evidence regarding the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped World and Will Define Future May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) that exists among the specialists a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration. 
The restrictions on immigration would weaken the growth and damage the labour market situation. 
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening the indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace by pressure exerted on their wages. 
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact essential complementary than the local wage workers, because they focus on the jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet the job. 
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors, local wage workers poking little talented among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not aligned with labour supply.

Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of Anästhesists, this complementarity between locals and migrants have a positive effect of Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation. 
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way, that a 1% increase in the flow of immigrants is a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0,6% and 0,9%. 
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants, as well as the economic growth is conducive to (a high proportion of eingebürgerter immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). 
The migrants also contribute net to the social systems in European countries on average, for example, in an amount of 1% of the total budget. 
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years after Germany immigrating the public budget on average a net contribution of his life (revenue minus expenses) of 150 000 euros. 
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of intersection "with teeth." 
These teeth, which were intended to deter the immigrants, but achieved exactly the opposite effect.
