Smart Krähen in cities 
In many places, Saatkrähen are seen as "problem birds," but from the cities the highly intelligent animals no longer drive a long time ago, experts say. 
Some people, they may want to get rid of the other very quickly: Krähen for centuries are part of the city, but in many communities there are mounting anwohner complaints about dirt and noise of the animals. 
It is a means to combat the "birds" have not yet in sight. 
Saatkrähen are no longer out of the cities, said experts at the first krähe symposium in ostfriesisch Leer. 
They consulted experts on possible ways out of the entire federal territory. 
They are looking for alternatives in the towns. 
Conservationists led the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the most protected krähes seed: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly vernichte the traditional habitats. 
The hunt, increasingly building and the cases of typical trees breeding birds made life difficult. 
Krähen are under protection of nature. 
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding mate, among other things in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among other things, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer. 
It was in 2005, a controversial project to the mass killing of Krähes in the district for negative publicity. 
Critics had the trapping of animals in wild birds and deployed with cudgels described as particularly brutal. 
"The normal displacement, the Vergrämen, brings nothing," the city and schaft county planner Werner Klöver from Leer said. 
Nestboxes are wegspritzen with water or trees, often have unintended consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg. 
"The animals are made up of large colonies divide and spread to other areas." 
Vergrämung is only as an exception to hospitals, Altersheimen or schools. 
"We have to live with them, we will no longer be away from them." 
Without the surrounding area will not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from Leer. 
It could be a combination of Vergrämen the animals from sensitive residential areas and offered to resettle them in other places. 
"Information boards rather than chain saws," against the psychologist and Uta Maria Ethnologin Jürgens for an entirely different approach to the animals: "A Pickel in the face, we can best endure self-confident." 
Jürgens had in Schleswig-Holstein the ash Krähen-Lehrpfad, which notices information about the lives of the highly intelligent seed krähes. 
The project will now have already been adopted by tourists. 
In addition to the criticism of the noise of the birds had Jürgens own opinion: "There is plenty of communication that have a lot to say." 
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen not only use tools to come to a biscuit, but as a tool for its tool even itself. 
Researchers at the University of Cambridge testing recently at four Saatkrähen, how far the intelligence of the birds. 
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they must bring down with stones a structure so as to arrive at a motte larve. 
Without much training realized they determined the size and shape a stone platform to collapse. 
In a second attempt had the smart Krähes then solve a knifflig problem. 
In a hat, the researchers had placed a small eimer with a motte larve. 
The birds could not reach their prey. 
However, the researchers had them wire. 
This shaped all four animals a snag, with whose help they will be the eimer angelten at the top of the bag. 
Three of the four Saatkrähen were even at first.
