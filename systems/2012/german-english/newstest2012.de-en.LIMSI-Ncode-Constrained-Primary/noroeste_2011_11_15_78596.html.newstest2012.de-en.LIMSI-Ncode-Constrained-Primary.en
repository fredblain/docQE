Climatic events bremsten the economy 
In the first year in which Mario Lopez took part in the government, unemployment rose in Sinaloa and the black economy, while the foreign investment fell and the economy stagnated. 
In 2011, the Sinaloas economic history remain in my memory, and it is the first year in which Mario Lopez Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and great hopes in terms of economic growth, fueled by the government, however, due to the climatic events cannot talk about growth, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated. 
The low temperatures in February have not only caused losses of millions of dollars in agriculture, but also the growth of the national economy close borders and caused in the first quarter of a general decline in economic activity by 3,6% this is mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development at 31.16 percent, the deterrent impact on other economic sectors. 
According to a from the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for sustainable agricultural development) report on the impact of the frost, there were 582 000 hectares of agricultural land damaged, with 78.03 percent and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed, and it affected all of the vegetables, corn and kichererbsen crops. 
The decline in economic activity until November, in the Mexican state unemployment to rise steadily, and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía were observed in the first quarter of a rapid rise in unemployment, from January to March had 55 053 Sinaloas inhabitants no employment, which is 4,53 percent of the working population; in the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5,28 percent from July to September to 6,19 percent, which is about 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa to 18 969 people more than in the first quarter of the year. 
Less liquidity 
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors: the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, dean of the School of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions indirectly declare growing unemployment. 
"What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, among other things with the loss of liquidity in the market due to the budget cuts by legislation, which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who accumulate dollars verboten, it is not easy to work for them to invest or otherwise use anything," he said. 
Migration stopped 
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also inherent in a demographic factor. 
"The number of people the country to seek work abroad, particularly in the United States, is declining. This is due to travel problems, on one hand, and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work, and these people stay here and looking for work, unemployment will rise," he says. 
Undeclared work 
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work. This includes, according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the country's employees, who work without paying into the coffers of the social security system. 
With regard to unemployment and undeclared work the low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Intergovernmental Authority for work and social care in Mexico). 
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September amounted to 5352 pesos; that is very much less than the national average, which stands at 7375 pesos. 
Decline in FDI 
As well as the dismantling of economic activity and rising unemployment will be in 2011 the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years, according to the Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority), FDI from January to June of 630 597 dollars, a loss of 87.74 percent compared to the 5,143,312 dollars in the same period in the previous year. 
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (governmental authority for economic development), for their part, recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, the company mainly comes from the tertiary sector. 
The debt 
In the face of the economic crisis, the provincial government requested in July at the National Assembly a loan in excess of 3 000,000 000 pesos to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects should be invested in the 18 districts. The national congress approved a sum in excess of 200,600,000 pesos, but have until November no positive effects of debt on some of the economic sectors in the country. 
Reactions 
As for the representatives of the company schaft, the first year of government, Mario Lopez Valdés government default obvious. 
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (the state chamber of manufacturing in Mexico), argued that in 2011 is not an effort to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the national government, have been made. 
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor in this year, and it needs to be worked hard to regain lost ground in this year and in 2012 we must double our efforts and the efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already good government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said. 
Economic development 
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year, the country's economic development and growth slowed. 
"The small business is the result of a number of events, including the frost, and one of the most important impact is a slowing economy, which is not enough to ignite an economic dynamism, a reasonable flow of processes, products and services could generate, and that is why we will be the year far below our expectations," he said. 
Redefine 
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Employers' Association) in Sinaloa, said the state should be to encourage more dynamic productive activities. 
"In general, we have seen that work has been done, and we believe that it is necessary for a long-term programme to redefine the economic appeal and to develop the country, because it is important that all material and human resources to activate Sinaloas," he said. 
There is much to be done 
The chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a vision of the future, which draws the efforts of the government in a better direction. 
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, but the economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said. 
He stressed that the current government is making progress in the government. 
"There are areas in which we can say that the government has acted more fully, but what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work before it," he said.
