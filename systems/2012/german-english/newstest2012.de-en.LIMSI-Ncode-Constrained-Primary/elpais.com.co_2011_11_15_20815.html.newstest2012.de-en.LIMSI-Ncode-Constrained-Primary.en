This was the work of the doctor, who identified the body of Alfonso Cano 
A Lophoskopist from Cali was the man who "Alfonso Cano" identified in the story. 
The work of these officials plays a key role. 
Last 4 November was a Lophoskopist of the investigative unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man of the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), confirmed: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of the fingerprints. 
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week had Eliazar González on-call, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years is cooperating in criminal investigations and proceedings. 
At the start of his career working in communities of Chocó, where he often five days had to go into the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were found, he should identify. 
2000 siedelte Valle and after the completion of the necessary courses he specialised in Lophoskopie, which is the study of the skin is exposed to the friction, i.e. the hand and foot. 
In the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar pointed out, clothes to put at least three days. 
Something big is expecting him. 
Friday night he flew in helicopters from Palmira to Cauca. 
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that there was a suspicion that a man who had guided the oldest Guerrilla in the world, and that is why he should Guillermo León Zehnfinger-Abdruckblatt Sáenz (his real name). 
However, when he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because it resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the least. 
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner. 
But fingerprints do not lie. 
Bewaffnet with a magnifying glass, ink, a Pflanzkelle and a pocket lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the abdruck page. 
He was right: it was "Alfonso Cano." 
The same night was this man coming from Puerto Tejada responsible for the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, pointing out that it really was the leader of the FARC. 
On the track 
For a Daktyloskopen from the Sijín in Cali, the commemoration of President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano" very important. 
Many people do not know our work. 
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which is a key factor in the dissolution of a crime. 
Lophoskopisten not only identify the bodies, they also support an investigation into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons. 
During their arrest, many criminals are false identity papers or they did not. 
We are taking fingerprints and searching for them in the database. 
The researchers told us that he was in a theft of a piece of the wall had to pull out of a house, because the thief had just aufgestützt with his hands at this point, as he is a safe filled with jewelry and money herauszog. 
"The walls are difficult, because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case, we have been able to take the shot in the hand and the criminals, who had participated in several thefts, identify," he recalled. 
With the help of the fingerprints of murder suspects can also be discharged or contaminated. 
Recently, a dead was surrounded by crackpot bottles. 
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be tatverdächtig and a fingerprint actually agreed on the bottle. 
Although it does not guarantee that the murderer, but he will be the place where the crime was committed. 
A Daktyloskopist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen would be taken away from the object." 
If they appear to be a Pflanzkelle or a band will be used for the carriage. 
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or Personenstandamt. 
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," said the expert from the CTI. 
He said that everything was not so much as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI. 
Just as it is not all gold that glitters is not everything it touches turns to a fingerprint. 
But he can still be used when carrying out an appropriate comparison.
