Military is under growing pressure from the crackdown in rape 
This week is an important hearing on whether to be indicted 28 men and women for failing to intervene in a rape in the military court . 
It should not happen , there are hundreds of prosecutor ready for the next hearing . 
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 th week pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldiers . 
It was in October 2008 and they just returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego the dinner with a friend , when they met at a male colleagues , the one he Pack; beer in 12 . 
He asked them , whether he is likely to accompany them along a drink in her room . 
My alarm went to " , " Lyman said . 
But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns . 
I thought: ' Oh , no , he is 19 . 
He is from Texas , " she said . 
" I wish I had listened to my gut instincts . " 
A few minutes after they were taken to Lymans Zimmer , the man behind it , put it down and raped them , it claims . 
This week , on 18 November , wait; Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials fearful of a process with a historic hearing in Arlington , Virginia , which will decide whether a complaint , it against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , have made , will be allowed in court . 
The complaint alleges that Gates and not Rumsfeld against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers . 
Rose to 28 in February by Susan Burke , a lawyer in Washington , D.C. , the complaint initially covered 17 claimants , but in the coming months:25 women and three men , all of which claim that they were raped by Soldatenkollegen or sexually abused , and that the military failed to identify , condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks , available to it . 
Burke says she has the top military leadership , as will the problem there . 
" The military is hierarchical , " she says . 
" Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retaliate; of ? The leadership . " 
Burke also says that she has contacted since February approximately 400 more survivors , many of them could be part of future complaints . 
Their strategy: instead of all the plaintiff adduces lay their eggs in one basket , they will , if necessary , many more complaints , in order to maintain the pressure . 
The team of defence for the Ministry of Defence , led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride , has made an application to reject . 
The files of the court , the Newsweek , in detail the defence strategy , primarily for the military , not of current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for injuries , which have occurred in the armed forces . 
Because of a law of the Supreme Court , which dates from 1950 , the so-called Feres-Doktrin , the government is not responsible for violations , the soldiers on active service . 
" The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiffs , " states the document . 
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story . 
Things have changed since the 1950 s . 
If women are not permitted to service is still in the fight , it is the distinction only in name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts . 
Team of female soldiers increasingly important roles to play in both Iraq and Afghanistan , particularly in the contact with local women in the war zones . 
The result: between the two wars , 150 soldiers have died , two thirds of them in hostilities . 
It is time that will modernize the military , says Burke . 
And it is not alone in their struggle as: three further complaints are out of their pending . 
At Yale Law School , the veteran ' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four most important military colleges because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere . 
This is independent of the voluntary Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military , to be out the diagnosis " personality disorder " focused , received the rape victims , in order to release them from the service - a way in which the activists as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women 's Action Network , a human rights group . 
Their group was in December complaint against the veteran administration (of .: management of war veterans), in which they did their discriminatory practices in its dealings with performance requirements for people , saying the , have been sexually abused in the service . 
Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties submitted to the Congress , which will provide a number of leads . 
In 2010 , according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (sposi .: Department of Defense Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse) 3.158 sexual abuses . 
But the majority of the abuses are not reported at all and , after the own estimate of the Pentagon takes account of this number around 13,5 per cent of the estimated 19.000 cases , which it per year . 
The report , which was published in March , is also examining the Strafverfolgungsraten:2010 was 20 percent of the cases in the military , only half as many as in the civil law in court . 
The plaintiffs in Burke 's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of non-newsworthy . 
In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the police less than an hour after the attack . 
In the night , she says , has been asked it 11 times , the details of the rape of a number of police officers , doctors and to tell commanders . 
They had a rape set and the blood of the shooter that arose from a cut on his arm , was found in her bed . 
Six months later , in April 2009 , was heard by a judge . Lyman during this hearing was asked after the sex , they had before the attack with her friend . 
Six people have said , as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator , who was acquitted . 
" I well remember the day when the verdict was read out , " Lyman says . 
" I thought the labor would use . I ran screaming from the courtroom . " 
" They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that I , when I go back to my commander , said: this was not his procedure . That was my procedure . " 
Lyman has been invited to visit a military psychiatrist , a personality disorder diagnosed and said for service . 
In January 2010 , it was honorably discharged , so that they have no support . 
Whether the complaint , the Lyman and the other plaintiff , have tabled , is pure speculation , says John Turley , professor of law at George Washington University Law School . 
Nonetheless , it says: " in my opinion they should move forward . " 
What stands between them and a judgment , is this doctrine , criticised the will , for the first time since she was called into question . 
I am a critic of the time life Feres-Doktrin . 
The military is lagging behind a decade , because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence , which is a liability . 
He adds: " The chances are against it ... but it is important for them that they try it . " 
These things will only change , if good people are ready to fight . 
If the hearing is not their way , Burke , the lawyer for the plaintiffs , start with hundreds of other plaintiff for future cases . 
" We will continue our struggle against the military in this regard , until it comes to reforms , " she says . 
Or until we die , whatever the first disposal; .
