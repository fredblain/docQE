What represents the fraud in sick; reports ? 
After the family allowances UMP and government now the turnover in attack . 
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday , 15 November in Bordeaux , to go to a family car--something aid and a speech on the - since 2007 - always recurring theme of the fight against fraud and to social economic dependence on the state . 
To accompany this attack , which is based on the desire to make the economy in a tough test , is not on the other hand , a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign , wants to focus the majority of workers ill . 
With the economic objectives: the government seeking to the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking a sick , with workers in the private sector . 
In plain terms , that means that a sick workers without approval of specific company would lose the wages of four days , so at least 15% of its monthly income . 
A Manahme which , according to the newspaper " Les echoes " threatens to anger , would help , however , to EUR 280 million . 
And the other with a Manahme rather symbolic in nature: give the state officials a unvergüteten Karenztag in disease case (so far are there for them , in the Gegensatze on the three Karenztagen in the private sector , no Karenzfrist). 
While these issues in the debate , the majority also anew the issue of fraud , but this time on the associated with Arbeitsabsenz abuse that are targeted . 
' controls will be much more important , and in addition , this rückzuvergüten , if requested , " warned Betrand Xavier on Sunday , 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL . 
As in other cases , the impact of this news about the reality of fraudulent activity in the areas of ill , a little unproportioniert . 
This is in fact already been the subject of permanent observation and political offensive operations , the most ever since 2002 have borne fruit . 
The French are not more ill more frequently than people elsewhere in Europe . 
But first we dwell in the national figures . 
According to the country , car--something CNAM were paid out in 2006 more than EUR 237 million days buy-offs . 
Gemä of economic research and documentation Institute of health care are the days buy-offs in 2008 with 11,3 billion 5% of health spending . 
Under this amount of 46% on maternity leave and work accidents and 54% on Krankheitsurlaube , expressed the EUR 6,2 billion . 
And therefore 2,5% health expenses . 
In 2010 , given the French to the 17,8 days in 2009 , according to a study by the Alma Consulting group on average only 14,5 sick days . 
Midway , of certain differences covered up: a different , in 2007 Monster.com , website for career development , was published , showed that 75 of the 40 th 000 , French workers said to have taken a single Krankentag . 
Another , this time from the health insurance buoyancy; study makes it clear that were 37% of the sick; reports in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days , 22% between 8 and 14 days , between 15 and 15 days a month , 15% between one and three months and 11% . 
Compared to their European neighbours , the French workers not to incapacity benefit more than elsewhere . 
One in 2010 of two researchers of the French state , Centre for science research (CNRS), the long-term study that between 1994 and 2001 the global Absenzquote (because of disease or otherwise) oszillierte , in France between 10 and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark , 15 in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands . 
The fraud in sick; reports is a very small proportion of the black economy . 
On the fraud will be achieved only a weak Ausma . 
Encouraging the legislation since 2002 means that there is systmatische controls on sick; reports that exceed 45 days . 
In 2008 , the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) under 1,5 million checks that 13 of the 285.000 of the past , short-term ill , the expressed in 37.050 cases , " unjustified or too long . " 
In the systematically controlled sick; reporting cases of more than 45 days , was one of 1,2 million 11% in " unangepassten or unjustified " cases , which expressed 132.000 . 
Overall , this is 169.000 ' unjustified ' cases on several million workers who have made a very ill . 
Represents a paragraph , the only a weak Ausmaβ against , for example , that of the black economy . 
According to the MPs Dominique tianming , author of a in July , Sachberichts on this issue , this is between 9 and 15 billion eurotaxes earnings per year , more than the total cost of daily allowances , and so much more than the Defraudation in last-mentioned .
