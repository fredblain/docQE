For EURES Costa Rica , fans of a dream , if others-plays Pearl jam in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for EURES fans ? 
Is a dream to play in Costa Rica , which is also for us . 
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America and , until now , it has been great . 
I am only once been on holiday to Costa Rica is a beautiful country , that we still have a few days they will stay there . 
It is exciting for us to bring our music there . 
I ask you this , because the fans of the bond completely , and they see the days before the concert given . 
What does it your most enthusiastic fans ? 
Thank you , all these years to be on our side . 
We have taken almost 21 years , until we have arrived in Costa Rica , and I am pleased to have been waiting for so long and we are very sorry to have taken so long , until we got here . 
Some people are of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year . 
Is this not a little pressure from your visit ? 
Some of the greatest shows that we found in the last 21 years have , in the last two weeks . 
We have played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica . 
Really , we want to play there . 
We love this country , we are like and surf the jungle; enthusiastic . For Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world . 
How did you do Costa Rica and its waves for surfing ? 
Many of our friend site and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo , where the waves are simply unimaginable . 
My friends are always surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua . Along with Mexico , the excellent areas for the surfing . In this way , people who love the surfing , we have heard about it . 
With a view to the tour have offered their giant shows with many songs . 
What you have plans for the event in Costa Rica ? 
Because we have never played there , we are also no borders . 
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs and we want a few songs from the album and give our fans a good and versatile repertoire . 
Their repeatedly your repertoire , never; 
Why ? 
I believe that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs , can play everyone likes another song , so that the decision , which we will play , is not easy . 
If we have two or three song , which we have long been not played , recorded in the repertoire , we maintain our focus better and they can surprise us , because they are the reasons why , we like this song , otherwise they could be forgotten . 
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe and , therefore , for the audience . 
With this tour celebrating your ways history . 
If it looks back , you find it hard to believe in your success ? 
Yes , totally . 
First of all , I believe that none of us has presented itself to play once in a great rock band , and that more than 20 years , which is like a dream . 
We are also further on this blessing and find it , still able to make music together . 
We can and we are thrilled to produce music . 
We are fortunate to be able to go to the places in the world , which we have always wanted to visit again . 
Things could not be better . 
What it meant for you , to have actively participated in the birth of the way ? 
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of large band . 
We are good with the people of Sound Guards , friends Mudhoney and Alice in Chains . 
It is surprising and very unusual , if a movement from a group of friends . 
Now and then , a bond from a city , but it is unusual , if five or ten groups at the same time from the same city . 
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group . 
Sometimes we still play together . 
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Guards on their tour , and we look forward , still friends with them all to be and it is to be part of this that Seattle-Sounds . 
It is also very unusual that a band as your zusammengeblieben is with the same musicians such a long time . 
Yes , four of us play together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago to us , and that alone is much more time than last for many band . 
First of all , I believe that we are all happy to be still alive , and also we care about each other . 
We are all close friend , why have opened up musical paths to allow everyone the freedom to experiment . 
A familiar with the others and its music , and it could not be better off . 
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy , on the other hand , why their thanks to your success always do what you wanted a . 
How is it a balance ? 
The way in which we are up to , has made it easier for ourselves , to find a balance . 
We are sure , not to be too often on tour , because it is too easy to forget this game with huge numbers of people who love your music , to escheat . 
As long as we keep in mind that the people are because of the music here , it reminds you that you , the music and what it has created , respected , without being too keen to be a famous rock star , which has never interested in us . 
How have you to your other project Mother Love cuts ? 
I believe that we have very good song written and to the beginning , it was great . 
We were a band for three years , until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) had never issued a record . 
We were disappointed , for so long , and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (TD), with us were the collar; friends when I hear a song or see photos , I think , what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , to laugh together and on music and football and many other issues . 
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him . 
The domestic bond Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica . 
Is it true that it knows its work , especially Eddie Vedder , and the band for the opening selected ? 
Yes , the production sent us videos of several groups and this band liked best and that is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live can offer , which will be exciting . 
Why change the text by Yellow Ledbetter always , if you live others-plays ? 
This is a question for Vedder Ed (Eddie), I have no idea . 
He sings it , and I believe that he is the first thing he chooses . 
By whom President; influenced you as Bassist ? 
Of so many + 
The first to come up with me , Geezer Butler , John Entwistle , C. J. Ramone , John Doe , Paul McCartney , Chuck Dukowski ... 
There are so many that I could talk about the Bassisten , which I liked , all afternoon . 
How has it Pearl jam , the way to keep alive , even though it is no longer a fad ? 
I do not believe that we all feel very connected with the word for . 
If I think about it , I can think of the band , which I have mentioned previously , for example , Mudhoney Sound Guards , nirvana and all the others who were at the same time , if they are still important , I think the great , because it is interesting to hear the music and band as Mudhoney make better music now than ever before . 
Initially was their music dark , now it is positive . 
Why ? 
This is interesting , because I believe that there are a few songs on the new album , which could be something lightly , but there are other songs such as The End or Just Breathe deemed to be a very dark song , although they also have a good thing in itself . 
To two of the tears when I heard it played as Ed . It is very dark song . 
I believe that if you are older and is something drastic in your life - for example , if you lose a family member or a friend - influenced the your artistic creation and your music and these two songs are the clear for me . 
However , I also believe that we can make a happier person and still dark music .
