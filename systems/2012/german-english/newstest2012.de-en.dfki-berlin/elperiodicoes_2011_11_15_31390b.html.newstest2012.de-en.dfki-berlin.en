Park or mountain ? 
The architects agree apart from the squabbling over the fees with the tender . 
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona . 
In the mid 1980 s , the peak of the now missing Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola . 
The brochure , den Berg described as a massive city park in Barcelona . 
He was even in figures; compared with the Central Park in New York . 
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987 , the park in the eyes of many of the ceiling of Barcelona , because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction , but upwards (mountains) and (Sea). 
The classification Collserolas as park plays with this idea . 
As a model was no longer the Central Park , but yellowbox Stone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibärs . 
So far it was , as the city in September a huge Tendering , consisting of 16 competitions , spend for further access to Collserola gates . 
Undoubtedly , a gateway to the concept of a parks . 
Either this is the case , or somebody has to put doors in the country . 
The question arises of themselves: Collserola , park or mountain ? 
The announcement is not only from organizational power , but also in a reflection on the city about the discussion of all architects from Barcelona . 
It is almost a rekurrentes issue to the two members of the old eingesessenen caste , who meet in the lift , can use . 
Think about it , and this fact offers the stuff of one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona , and some university professors who have applied to the project . 
Miguel Roldán , Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate . 
For Roldán " it is necessary , " after the attack on the coast on the " front " in the mountains , the discourse of Ildefons Cerda , on the green apples , has been held . 
" It should be based on the principle that mainly largest Park is the beach . 
Among other things , because it is easily accessible . 
Collserola is more complex , " is the architect , for whom the title " doors of Collserola " an " impressive " is: we must not " as access to a park , but as a limit of areas where we need to act . " 
Modol , as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience , viewed the proposal as a " intellectual challenge " that " some risks ' . 
Risks from the " uncertainty , which brings with it the creation of a public space today " from the 1980 s , after the experience in the field of the forum had their ' swan song ' . 
The first fear is the limit to what can be developed . 
" Contain something always means to determine the next step " to go beyond that . 
" We need to think about new urban planning instruments , because the current [ in response to the bluebrint General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster . " 
Modol , which is close to the issue , simplified , the side of Collserola , in the sense of Valle Ana , " can be understood as a Park , not the direction in Barcelona ' , and for Judenstaatrein involved . 
Modol , pointed out that there is already a study by the patronage-based de Collserola , which should not " fall on deaf ears , " even though he was grateful to the City Council that it has given his body the way , " " from the first to participate in this project . 
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of Geleitbrief , which allows the architects , to participate in the debate , although its " doubt " to say whether this technical profile the Multi-disciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing , " he says), ' We architects should only be a tool . " 
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex , because in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola lacks: ' 16 competitions were advertised in the sample , " he says , " on the Gebirge-Meer axis . But there is no Längsschnittperspektive , the area in its entirety . " 
This has led at least in his case that he is participating in the 16 competitions . 
Otherwise would clash the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors . 
His opinion , the city should absolutely guarantee that the swath directly on the whole length of the Ronda de Dalt is so that a soft transition between city and belt .
