Troops feel more sympathy than respect 
The event was a Wall Street-Gala , collected the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City . 
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness , frustration and loss . 
On cue hundred soldiers , sailors , pilots and marines gathered around him . 
The amount in black Smokings stood up and applauded . 
" The servicemen and women were seen as heroes , " said David Saltzman , who organised the effort in the spring . 
A senior military officer at the gala , which among other things , the chief of staff and former chairman , has been observed Admiral Mike Mullen , the role of the troops . 
" They were introduced as orphans , " the officer wrote in an e-mail . 
I am sure that the organisers have said it well . 
I know that . 
But there was no respect , not really , it was pity; . 
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and of the most distant , sometimes admiring American public . 
The troops are showered with praise for their victims . 
But the praise has a price , service members . 
The public is increasingly so , as would the people in uniform suffering . 
" We were not victims , " said brigade Fiscal√≠a Sean example MacFarland , the troops in Iraq or free and will soon go to Afghanistan . 
" But it seems that the only way the support that is , in the role of unfortunate souls to inflate . " 
The issue is very sensitive for military leaders , not ungrateful or in the dispute with the public they serve , to appear . 
Also recognise that the anger , the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War , was much worse . 
As a result there are discussions on pity; in the Pacific and private sector between war veterans . 
With his two sons returned from fighting with the marines , warned the retired Colonel Mark Cancian it that could see people outside the military world their service from two different perspectives . 
Some would see it with a sense of reverence , as they defeated rebels and went to exotic places . 
Others would ask whether a " angry , violent veteran beneath the surface , " said Cancian , who had fought in Iraq and has taken on his return a key state posts in Washington . 
During his job search , he said , he felt that they obtain some of the interviewer subtly , whether he is in a position to withstand immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington . 
" If you only talk about your service , you need the negative impressions are fighting , " declared Cancian his sons . 
The lack of ease of the American military is rooted in part in the lack of interest in the war . 
Services will be on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and only see little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , only rarely as encomia singled out . 
" We as a nation , not military heroism more so , as it was in the Second World War , absolutely , " said Lieutenant General David Barno retired , inspired the US troops in Afghanistan . 
Instead , the praise of the politicians and the public largely on the suffering of service members . 
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks , which they have endured , the number of friends that they have lost or for the severity of their injuries .
