V Need for steroids: " The turgidity " - the illegal race across America 
Recession; 
The original reckless journey is through a series of entirely preventable , dilettantish mistakes; routine in the morning . 
It was , the ambitions; in large part to play , but what is the point , if there is clearly no one wish , a bit more to do . 
Even before he came to the Ladentische , the new part of Brejão with subtitle , " The turgidity " high expectations . 
He promised , but the old games series " Need for steroids " to postpone a step into a new dimension and in the spielbaren demonstration in play seemed to be not only one of many Action-Rennspielen . 
We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages in which the main protagonist from the car , and continue on foot . 
But how NFS is , is actually a case , so accustomed than was expected . 
Sure - there are potentially very decent Arkade-Rennen , but on the whole , the game from a number of unnecessary errors , which are present in this series are already more or less a few years . 
So there are no more mistakes , but signs of incomprehensible laziness in principle the games developers . 
The adventure begins very well . 
First introduced it in history , has its main character Jack certain problems personal nature , the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America . 
In San Francisco , on the west coast , set to the wheel , with the task to be first in New York . 
The basic idea is a whole series of interesting elements . 
The whole route is divided in ten stages and in more than fifty individual race . 
This means that every race on other route and that the various stages in different , different and interesting enough milieu . 
One gets the impression that game would not take a moment to offer the same thing over and over again . 
Some of these environments are still very nicely , though , not the technical level the graphics on the earlier part of the series . 
So nothing called; . 
But the journey through the desert , herbstliche landscape or high above--relatively visually inspected by verschneite landscape we very pleasant . 
Now and then atypical elements a little change in the individual race . 
In the desert , for example , is surprised by a desert storm , which reduces the point of view . 
In the mountains , in turn , must you need to watch that you will not by an avalanche of being buried . 
By the way are quite good running the individual race . 
Only a few , but they are . 
For a while they tried to overtake so , the number of compulsory opponents (in principle) a classic race , then there will be time (classic race against the stopwatch), then expected an even a personal duel with a single opponent . 
And that also involves himself the police , the whole thing will blow . 
A novelty are passages in which Jack out of the car . 
It is more about certain interactive , in which Jack before anyone is and where he has to help the players in the right moment , the right button . 
So nothing complicated . 
It is surprising , however , that there is in the game much less such passages , as one would expect (actually only three). 
After all , this is to the advantage of rather , because this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above--relatively point one of the elements that make the game diversify . 
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts . 
This means that from today 's point of view , it is no trees , on the other hand , you could not say that it would be bad . 
Who realistic simulations , must look elsewhere . 
But a action; invited Rennfahren meets the European Fahrmodell continue , although could be found in the competition better . 
Until then , as far as everything is well . 
Real problems , only after a certain time . 
In contrast to the Fahrmodell is not the conflict-of-law model quite OK 
Of a game of this kind is difficult to expect that it complicated deformations and collisions , but if it has virtually no impact on any object idea , what the car is doing , then obviously not everything is in order . 
Typical example: the close do or over--and drive to oncoming cars " does " in some of the other car only slightly , in others , almost identical situation is but skidding and is wild performance . 
Or the Karre to scrap . 
Thanks to the Restart-Systems makes it no more , it is annoying . 
The rest are resolved as Arts: if you total damage has or is far outside the line , then a the game on the last point . 
Only - in every race has only five rest Arts . 
If they have exhausted , all from scratch . 
The rest are Arts , rather as a tool in the event that is not something that should leave but not on it . 
Helps sometimes but not even the Restart , and nothing else , as the critical section to learn from the head . 
Extremely unpleasant , is that the same things happen often in the same places . 
Some curves must pass through , for example in a specific way , otherwise it is not easy . 
Elsewhere it in his list " civilian " cars are in the same configuration , whether it be the first and fifth , five seconds sooner or a minute later . 
It is annoying to see that , particularly in situations of Kontrahent before a romped two oncoming cars are ignored , but until it gets to the cars already in such a position that they must stop or to avoid it . 
And there is no difference when we arrive , everything is designed so that there is this situation--help close to your nose . 
The opponents have other benefits . 
Throughout the game , there are a few places where you always in the same place the same opponents obsolete , and will be again regardless of the time . 
The crazy TENs this is at the end of the game on the long bridge , which is in the right direction . 
The Kontrahent must here seem to overtake come hell or high water . 
And then , when it is facing a , then of course it makes a point of view , so we will initially other-gender car a couple of times in Klump . 
Clear - trying to make the game simply more exciting and exciting events but this intention is so clearly , fulfill--even anticipate--a quickly , the joy of account; spoiled . 
And this is a pity , because despite sold Fahrmodell is the game as a whole rather entertaining and in some places so aktionsgeladen , that almost no longer know , where one of the head . 
And in principle , no matter what it is - " over-reward " the concept with  unique routes , the organisation of the race in a way that can prevent boredom , or something quite different ... 
An unusual idea is the least in the course of the race . 
We must not overlook the petrol stations on the road , because here you can switch the car , although there is in most cases the car , which has one . 
The cars are divided into three categories . 
The sports cars are well suited to the urban areas , the strong American brand for the precise motorways and exotic Super-Sportwagen for the technical journeys; , for example , on the Serpentinen in the mountains . 
Hand in hand with the way the game history is also the Aufgaben-Modus (challenges) - the race in the individual premises , we know from history . 
Here there are not only medals , but also to gain experience for their own profile that together for the tasks (challenges) and history . 
In order to get to the higher level , drivers must be open to different objects: from the car , to the Backgrounds for the profile . 
This is linked to the online role Autolog , among others , the own achieved results with those of other players and also for further collective functions . 
One of Schnitzern further incomprehensible is a situation in the last race of the history . 
Here it is: the car in a passengers; (as), where it is in the dark on the track for desecrate (as). 
On the speed dial look between paragraphs 150 (a) 200 km / h (I), but there is suddenly from behind a metro and is a tough to scrap . 
In our editorial , as well for a long time about whether a blackout in the game makers was or whether to keep the authors is so stupid . 
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall is in most cases very appealing and even brilliant here and there . 
Even more galling is that some of Bildwiederholfrequenz exciting times and this sometimes quite dramatic . 
This is particularly the case for accidents with greater number of concerned , where a continuous FPS nothing good . 
As far as the Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound track is taste . 
In an effort to address a as broad as possible range rather young audience , created a Soundtrack a lá ' by each buy something " - but who is such a game because of the music ? ! 
The overall picture on Need for steroids: The turgidity ? The feelings are more mixed . 
If the game not by the already-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes , we would have with the held belief that The turgidity is the best piece of NFS in recent years . 
But so is the game somehow unfinished . 
To be a pleasure , but we should be prepared that this mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eyes .
