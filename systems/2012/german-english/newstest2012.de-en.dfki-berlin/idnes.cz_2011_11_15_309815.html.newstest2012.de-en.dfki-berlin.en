Experts; claim - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist 
In the initial article , learn how Stylisten , I always had a little bit that this was a bit too much fuel for the beginning . 
I was not in the slightest , which still is . 
Lectures of three professionals in the industry , the clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how the " in the square " . 
It is even worse to come . 
The closer we get to the test is , the more information and practical challenges; us before . 
But even when there is of course any on Saturdays and Sundays , he is nevertheless fully . 
This time , we debated with Director Alena (on course is not a single man), as a woman , which has no ideal proportionierte figure . 
And most of us . 
Have a short neck and the other to a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig . 
It is a matter for the Stylisten , broad shoulders look to conceal , conjuring up the neck or the necessary graphs . 
We got tips on how to Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - therefore , with great bosom , a hip and narrow their - nicely and attracts figurbetont , without fulfill--even too provocative . 
If , for example , the difference between their and hips is so great that the rock or the trousers really does not suit , it should at least a piece of clothed; groups . 
This will certainly be not regret , because good clothes is simply unaffordable . 
In such a tailor-made Rock you feel are much better than in a , the high and verrutscht , in the course of their absteht , etc . 
Jungenhafte figures can afford , in turn , clothing with wrinkles , construction , applications , lace or to take Raffung . 
For this amount of information and Figurtypen I am glad that I have a whole week time to let me go through the Oxfam-International everything thoroughly . 
And yet , I fear , not to create it is given the task assigned House almost . 
All the participants were given a Promi , for which they should devise appropriate attire - days clothing and Abendrobe . 
We are the current appearance , the Modestil of the corresponding stars and its Figurtyp on board . 
To Miranda Kerr " , " that you may be from the campaign ' know Victoria 's Secret . 
Within juble I , because it is much better for me personally , as , for example , Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera , the last time on the hundred kilos has increased (oh well , this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez . 
The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet , state and then deal with graphically . 
In the ' Moodboard ' , as the whole result is known , is our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design . 
It is very important to consider the graphic side of the Stylings too . 
The Stylist attracts the model not only physically , but is also known as the product side in the journalist (after concrete , for example , Trend-Handtaschen coats , etc .). 
Full-status told us of the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník . 
But the only on Sunday . 
That means that must have a Stylist a good overview . 
The figures with information on type-approval angefüllte Saturday speech was peppered from three visitors from the industry: 
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný , from fashion designers Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben . . 
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this . 
And eingeschickter Stylist able to work with a single piece of clothing in a different way . 
The magic word means variability . 
So you can take , for example , a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans , a T-shirt or coat , you can have it but also on the naked body , subparagraph shoes to attract and take it as a dress . 
Enough is enough , or roll up our sleeves and get to see from the whole look very different . 
" Others-plays , " he said . 
Most came to me but the following Council: " First of all , you have to know the rules perfect . " 
" Only then you must violate them , " said Jakub . 
It is clear to me why we need to pauken all these theories , which can be combined with what and why , even if you get to see in Modejournalen often quite different . 
Not to mention fashionable look . 
Thanks to the photographers Ben I know now , that must have prepared a Stylist much more clothing options , as photographed it . 
So we need for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared , at least fifteen to stylen . 
And also that the clothing on the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality . 
With all of this , so in the design of the attire . 
That image and Styl sometimes make up half of the success , which confirmed a Jan Pokorný as well . 
Because one needs only to Madonna , not just a brilliant singer , have made the image and marketing a world star . 
In the Czech Republic is the services of a Stylisten rather reserved . 
Also doet people often think that this is a wasted money (the main thing is that I bring something , how I turned out is secondary). 
And if any of us stylen , then we should expect that he or she is very likely a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs . 
It needs to be googlen then only to determine with certainty that writes the tabloid press , the Promi have declined to or , etc . 
On Sunday , Jan and Mario Inter-ministerial us not to believe , that we are in Stylist just to focus on the fashion and then the clothes " assemble them " needs . 
In his work must communicate it , especially with the people who he stylt and he must be a clever psychologist . 
People think , without curry favor and stick to its opinion . 
" If any of us , a director in order to see their clothes cabinet and to complement fine , we can clear up and say we have the whole cabinet - my God , this is terrible . " 
" You have to find at least a few worthy things , to which it recommends , what they can contribute , " says Mario . 
He showed us in real terms , as a so-called " place pocket; " must include . 
So a pocket; , the pre-Maastricht in the waists zuknöpft and in the pre-Maastricht all the necessary Proprietäten in . 
No such clear , as gap , Abroller to remove hair or security needles , they also Utensilien , such as a Nylonfaden (it helps the Stylist the photographing of products , such as handbags or avoid), specific clips , which will be tightened up , the clothes , if it is too big Stecknadeln (or other Klemmen are banned , so that is not the substance of) and , of course , Nähzeug . 
So we must listen to but not only , but also to try something , we learned , as in we put shoes . 
Is also in the photography at the courses , where the floor is , it is the Schuhsohle damage , let alone the outside . 
We klebten o and klebten we ... 
With the gap must be the shoes again , so that they are not damaged . 
So we must be really well . 
Mario was me , by my " creation " praised without restrictions . 
The skill is not just mentioned my strength . 
All this was only a fraction of what we did in the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs . 
One thing is clear to me now - to address the styling at a professional level is not an easy task .
