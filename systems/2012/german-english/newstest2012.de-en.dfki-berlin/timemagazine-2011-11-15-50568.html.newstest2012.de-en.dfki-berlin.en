7 lessons from the interviews with the late Steve Jobs , was shown this week in a theatre 
Compared to the death of Steve Jobs on October 5 , some with Henry Ford and stressed the technology; genius as a great modern inventors . 
What are Apple-Fans but perhaps the most in the recently discovered Jobs-Interview , which has been dusted off this week before special film displays on the major markets , is how has this very creative head; business processes and procedures . 
He was certainly a designer , a dreamer and even appointed Hippie , but he was also a meticulous detail organizer , the bastelte to Diagrammen - a man who believed that many business leaders " a disease of thought , ' that ' is a really great idea 90 per cent of the work ... [ but ] there is a huge amount of craft-type art between a great idea and a great product . " 
1995 , Bob Cringely the TV series ' triumph of the computer . Fachidioten " with the dawn of the staff and he was sitting for more than an hour with jobs , in the one of the rare , detailed talks led . 
At that time were passed over 10 years , since then had been pushed jobs; from Apple , and already he was working hard on his new computer companies NeXT , and looked forward to the broad adoption of the Internet . 
While used a small part of Cringleys interview in specialist idiots , he says that the lack of Kopiervorlagen interviews in the supply . 
Only after Jobs death discovered a full VHS-Kopie in the garage of the director . 
This easy; revised film material is the basis for the 68 film of " Steve Jobs: The Lost interview , " which is this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark-Theater . 
For someone who is known for its extensive interviews , jobs here surprisingly busy in its technological philosophies and business strategies . 
And incredibly pause . 
In the course of the interview it is four times to longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds Nachsinnen , where jobs is clearly his thoughts balance and accuracy . 
There are moments in which jobs ' perfect days , when he apparently impatiently awaiting Cringelys issues to react and it anschubst , faster on issues or Nebenhandlungen of greater importance . 
Before the era of Pixar , iPod or iPhone seems somehow that people interview included far-sighted , if jobs , what other companies with him right or wrong and its own vision for the future of the computer . 
It is a thing; posthumous awards the career jobs ' to read , but jobs here as the thrill of greedy dreamer to see , which is on the leap to the grandeur , is something quite different , original and inspiring . 
He has a vision of how things could be and should be . 
Shortly after he had said all this here , he drew and made it . 
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the Verlorenen interviews: 
As he learned to lead a company: 
" Throughout the years in the business I always ask , " Why are you doing things ? " And the answer , you always get is , ' Oh , it will be easy . " 
Who knows why he does what he is doing , nobody in the business to think very carefully about things . 
I have noticed that . 
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline from , the accounting; Apple . 
Were amazed to see costs recorded - predominantly began with " Standardkosten " , the mere suspicion been costed and which were then adapted with " deviation " - it developed an automated factory , who ensured that the recurring costs until the regulations could be determined . 
As has been veralbert the Pope: 
Jobs; told of the " Blue Box , " which he has built with Steve Wozniak , a device , with the people in the telephone company creep and could lead to talks in vain . 
Has been on the machine , but jobs enthusiasm , as he describes the bluebox as an act of Selbstbemächtigung , is contagious . 
He describes how he Wozniak and test the box; would , by using a gebührenpflichtiges telephone , and then working a phone call from a AT in another , while it so many durchschleifen satellites as possible . 
" We sent the half a dozen times in the world and if we grölte into the phone , came a minute later in the telephone next door , " said kichernd jobs . 
" We were young and we learned that we can build something themselves , can control the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world . " 
We both , we did not know much , but we were able to build this small things that can monitor a huge thing , it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would give Apple without them . 
Sake; tells us further away from a glorious gimmick , the Wozniak and he almost made have withdrawn , in the middle of the night via bluebox in the Vatican phoning and wanted to talk with the Pope , while it as far as they could Henry Kissinger nachmachten . 
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night to have been called in to speak with the American diplomats , the two loslachen , before the Pope to the telephone . 
As he is in the technology; president (Bill Hewlett and unprepared dispute): 
At the age of 12 , when it was looking for spare parts to build a spectrum meters , he sought after Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him . 
Shortly after their 20 -minute telephone call , jobs for the summer work part-time in Hewlett-Packard . 
" This has had a remarkable impact on me and it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what was a company; and how well his staff treated . " 
Later , Jobs one of the HP-Mitarbeiter , the corporation 's research laboratories in Palo Alto visited; , where he was " the first Desktop-Computer , of the ever produced . " 
He was as big as a suitcase , had a small screen with Braunscher tunnel and I admitted in him . 
I would take the HP upwards as a teenager , and are committed to this machine and programmes for they write . 
How innovation improved: 
Several times in the interview , jobs , how do we invent spontaneously new products . 
Some boards early in his career , when he einbaute , he was asked by a customers , the whole computers to assemble them . 
He was working with a payment period of only 30 days and both had to rethink the processes and the extradition of the earth-orbiting equipment . 
Later in Apple is he is reminiscent of the problems , which he had in the development of a mouse: 
" I remember quick-dispersing arguments ... you cried to me that it would take five years [ to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 ] and I was on , went out and found a manufacturer . " 
Ninety days later we had a mouse , we have to build for $ 15 , which was incredibly credible . 
On large companies that continue: 
Long before he Apple lead , saw jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants with their vision in founder and lost control of their shares . 
" We say , you are working with IBM , Xerox , make you a better room or printer , so what ? " 
They have the equities--were monopoly , is not the company more successful . 
Sales and marketing such people make it successful , so [ there are ] , which ultimately lead the company and the product , with which people are being pushed out of the decision-making process . 
The product genius that has led to this monopoly , will of the people who have no concept of good products versus bad products , stamping-out - craft-type art . 
This happened in Xerox ... 
Xerox would have the whole computer industry . 
It could have been ten times greater , could have been the Microsoft of the 1990 s ... 
They have caught the defeat by the victory . 
On innovation as art form: 
" It is a lot of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product ... when we have these great idea , changing it developed and is growing . " 
We are learning a lot about his legalisms . 
It must be votes , certain things that you can 't do , but electrons , glass , machines; factories . 
We must mark 5000 things , these concepts , and bring it all together ... 
Ultimately it is tantamount to the taste , it comes down to is that an attempt is being made with the best stuff that people have created , and then tried to bring these matters to the together , what you do . 
Picasso said that good artists copy , great artists steal . 
We are always shamelessly stealing in the great ideas . 
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there , musicians , poets , artists , Zoologen , historian who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world . 
It would not have been in the computer business , they would create fantastic things in other areas .
