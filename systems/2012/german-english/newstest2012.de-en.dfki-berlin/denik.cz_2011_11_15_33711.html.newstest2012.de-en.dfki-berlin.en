Development of the travel prices since 1989 
Until 1989 there was in the SSR only five approved state travel agents: edok , Sporturist , CKM , Rekrea and Autoturist . 
The travel agents sold at the time , especially only travel in the socialist bloc , in the West were the only chosen . 
And so , Czech tourists in the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union in the Crimea peninsula (Sochi on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to use it . 
Was a silver excep the period from 1962 to 1972 , when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia , then a pro-Western course a proposed Yugoslavia and have therefore been severely restricted travel to Yugoslavia . 
A great paradox of socialist times it was the fact that it may not even be citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel within the framework of the socialist countries . 
If I wanted to travel a citizen of the SSR for example individually to Poland or even in the Soviet Union , then took it to a so-called invitation letter , were not Individualreisen possible . 
Even then , to the travel agents also travel to the West , then had to be huge queues in purchasing or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel agency , or at least " good friends " in the travel agency . 
Also so the matter was not yet . 
The so-called currency - the condition for an exit to the West - was only " politically reliable " of people - the other could not travel . 
The Czech currency was not free exchange as currency , foreign exchange , it would have been impossible , so the necessary funding (Western) find currency for a trip to the West . 
The way most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home , it is no wonder that bought the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas - a habit that continues to this day . 
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip to the revolution of the Czechs . 
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR in Bulgaria or the measure of all things , spent the Czechs last year 4,5 million their holidays abroad in countries around the world . 
A huge paradox , which is not at all now , is the fact that , in the most popular holiday country the Czechs - could not travel to Croatia 1989 at all , because it was part of the former Yugoslavia . 
From the beginning of the 90 s of the last century was lifted in the foreign exchange duty in the neighboring West European countries , which caused a huge wave of short visit especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany . 
The Tschechoslowaken could not get over a long period of their trips to the West simply enough , everyone wanted to have at least a few days since . 
So slept the Czech holidaymakers in travel to Paris in the tent in the park , because who would have guessed the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension . 
A typical feature when they travel abroad by Czechs was a with canned , beer and sausages , etc . Vollgepackter boot . 
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades , our tourists buy the Western currency finally free . 
Our standard of living and , consequently , the average salaries rose to 1997 , which einmündete in another important moment . 
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to prepare the travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by charter flights , which the air travel because of the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts , economy--with compared to the past . 
At the end of the 90 s , the Czechs , with the exception of the United States , already exchange of payment with all advanced countries in the world , making it even easier travel . 
Another interesting moment in the history of the " post-utopian Velvet ' travel there was in 2000 , when it was Community-cleared thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - to Thailand . 
Since then fly direct Charter-Flugzeuge with Czech passengers every year in distant sunny countries; this year flies directly from the Czech Republic  exotic destinations . 
Of the 100 Tsd . Czechs travel every year in exotic places ! 
Another important moment in the era , which our ' post-revolutionary ' development marked , came in 2008 . 
Roll on 17 November 2008 , the US visas for Czech tourists , which most definitely our country under the most developed countries of the world . 
More than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in years the Czechs spent 2008 (50,3%) and for the first time in its history peasants-a it for a single Urlaubsaufenthalt including the costs on the destination for more than 15 Tsd . CZK per capita .
