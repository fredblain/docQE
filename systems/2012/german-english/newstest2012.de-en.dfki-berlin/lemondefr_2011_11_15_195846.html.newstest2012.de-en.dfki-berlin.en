The CDU is proposing to elect the EU president with the advent of vote 
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday , 14 November in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel , Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party , without any real difficulties . 
The future of Europe was not originally intended in the programme , but has prevailed in the autumn , in particular those activists enough to do that , the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax . 
The proposed by the Bureau Presidencies request from the European Commission has approved almost unanimously . 
Less than 1001 delegates voted only nine , ten had abstained from the vote . 
Several minutes of standing ovation , which were due to the Interventionserlässen first Angela Merkel and a few hours later , Wolfgang Schäuble , lieen from the three ec-syria tended to finance ministers no doubt . 
The idea of the Chancellor - as well as the application - slogan: the answer to the crisis is " not less , but more Europe . " 
Not simply because Europe means peace , but also because " nine million jobs directly dependent on the euro . " 
For the Chancellor is " the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe . " 
This could be through the control of the European Union reinforcing altering of the Lisbon Treaty in terms of the budget of the countries in the euro area could be expressed , as well as this , however , in the election of the president of the European Commission on the basis of general vote , " in order to give Europe a face . " 
However , this is certainly one of the proposals for a resolution approved by Congress , which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble . 
Certainly , it is unlikely that the 47 agree quickly to this revolution: Groβ-Britannien is is the thing; hostile , and the chief of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion . 
However , the milestone is . 
Also rejected the delegates in an overwhelming majority the proposal of the weighting of any country in the Executive Board of the weighting of the individual economies , which would seem a more powerful position of Germany . 
The way the climate within their party safe--by Chancellor has reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl , who has not , however , its Congress at the expense of the " small " or to win in difficulties European countries , which would criticise the arrogant Germany . 
As far as of the request of the importance of the Franco-German friendship " is a paragraph , not Angela Merkel France on the plan . 
At least not directly . 
Because it reminded that was Leipzig two centuries ago in the centre of a bloody battle . 
In fact , one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army .
