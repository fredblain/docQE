Euthanasia and physician-assisted Freitod must be legalised , a panel of experts 
The Canadians live in denial of death , as stated in the report of the Royal Society of Canada 
The body , said that governments , institutions of the health care , and doctors did on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources , and this is also about the cancer cases . 
The Canadian society is living in a state of denial about the death . 
Only 9% of Canadians are a really out to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements for this purpose . 
This is one of the conclusions of an excellent report by the Royal Society of Canada , were involved in the six experts , the different subject areas , including ethics , justice and medicine--a are linked . 
This body , the Government to amend the penal code so in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia , where this election , and for patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision . 
As a prelude to the experts a recent poll by the independent EIU society , which had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the Erdballes . 
Although has placed in Canada at the 10 th , the study noted that " has produced the death medical care in Canada a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death . " 
Medical care or not:77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers , tell us the of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts . 
And despite the desire of the overwhelming majority of Canadians , to die at home , so die , however , 68,6% of these in the hospital . 
The whole country is considered the rate with 86% in hospital deaths in Quebec . 
In the sensitive issue on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide are the authors of the report to conclusions that the position of the federal government , which has already geäuert , no changes to the law on euthanasia and want to begleitetem suicide , are against . 
But now there is according to the experts , the gleichermaβen all those countries have inspected; , whose approach legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide or drug use , we have no proof that such a non-criminalisation Miβbräuche in their application , so the Praxisdurchführung of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting persons would entail . 
Quite the reverse you encounter much more cases such breaches in the countries in which are not legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide , as yesterday Jocelyn Downie , a co-signatory of the report , in a teleconference . 
" Euthanasia is illegal in Canada , where they are clearly , practised . " 
" Also physician-assisted suicide is practised in Canada , although clearly here illegally , " says Jocelyn Downie . 
Canadians support the euthanasia 
We have that , according to a -approximately- in 2010 Angus-Reid-Umfrage already carried out 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert had , as they are of the opinion that this would allow it to alleviate those at the end of their career , their diseases; . 
And 66% believe that do not have the issue of legalisation of euthanasia , to convey the message that besäe the lives of older or disabled people less value . 
In terms of the people who already have implemented a assisted suicide , the respondents to 41% are of the opinion that this should not be prosecuted . 
As far as maintenance or the resources to patients , the situation is less clear , the authors of the report . 
Similarly this in their Empfehlungsverzeichnis should be close to that in the penal code tunnel; , that the possibility of the funds , for the legal rejection , there have been not as criminal should apply . 
The panel of experts , that should be trained health care professionals in the task to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life , and this without fear of prosecution . 
The body , said that governments , institutions , health care and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources , and this is also about the cancer cases . 
Least , calls on the body where already wide-ranging in the Canadian institutions to health care means used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen , at least to consider it , because these little as well as the euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and they relate to the same procedures spawned . 
Reservations other experts 
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts report published by the Royal Society of Canada . 
RA Pierre Deschamps , specialist in health law , has the attitude of the report " experts interests--including as ' extremely ' , because this is the practice of euthanasia in the final stage no borders . 
" This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and more than 18 years to ask another person to be him in his suicide help , " RA Deschamps , who had looked at yesterday a summary of the report . 
RA Deschamps also stresses , the author of the report seemed to put the responsibility of the individual above all others who are involved in the social upholstery of society . 
But now , he says , there would be " guidelines and obligations in a society . " 
Margaret Somerville , expert on health law , also has a " strong opposition " to the conclusions of the report , which they described as " Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest ' . 
Margaret Somerville , which is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada , is in particular , the report claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries in which legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide , such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon .
