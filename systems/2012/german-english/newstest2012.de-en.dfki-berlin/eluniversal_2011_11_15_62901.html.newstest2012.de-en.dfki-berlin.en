Asphalt by the UNAM prevent potholes 
Rafael Herrera , researchers at the School of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM with Polymeren modified Asphalte , in order to make the mixture more resistant to weather and temperature changes 
Would the signs that are based on the road surface , respected , it would not be necessary to fix almost 200 000 potholes , if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera , researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM , and gave warning that if this were to happen and laying the maintenance of the Asphaltbelags , reduced the number of potholes , or even be avoided completely . 
" Bumps " from a technical point of view , in his speech he gave at the International Year of Chemistry , he knows that the laboratory , for which he is responsible , with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing , however , in order to establish a the asphalt similar mix , the greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures . 
Herrera said Nájera that this type Asphalte modified in areas with extremely hot climate , such as in some cities in the north of the country , should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of the holes . 
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon link , which is part of a high Molekulargewicht - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other a low - the so-called Malthene . Together; give them the road surface be typical zähelastisches behaviour . 
Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C as a liquid , at 120 ° C , it is very liquid , and in 50 ° C , while he is in very low temperatures fragile . 
" That means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the roads is not uniform , but on a day depending on the weather and temperature changes change ' , the engineer . 
The researchers said the FQ , the streets of Mexico City have majority a flexible road surface which , together , from six material; classes , which included the last three asphalt . 
Between the top classes is a abrasion-proof layer of asphalt , from the small , in gebadeten asphalt and then entrenched stones . 
Every single piece this decay , had been bathed in asphalt . 
If the vehicles to travel and produced forces , this class a good forces; distribution in the road surface . 
" If it were modified asphalt , would distribute the forces , even better , " said the chemical engineer . 
" On the Verschleißschicht " , he tells us , " will be a final layer , the so-called Tragschicht , interpreted the from tiny stones , that is , from sand , which has also been in asphalt sweating . 
Because they are class in contact with the car tyres , they need a greater force than the mechanical abrasion-proof class and they must produce friction . 
The this road receives the most forces and distributed , the Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is , must be maintained . 
The weather conditions , including humidity and temperature fluctuations , are more important to take into account factors , above all , the water , " he said , " because it affects the behaviour of the abrasion-proof class . 
If the site is a wet , water in the class and is only difficult; back; that caused a watering down of all sections of the surface and as a result , the incidence of stroke . 
If a pothole , " he said , " will make the Titanic-Maru class , while the abrasion-proof class then , but the damage is not immediately , but it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs of proper maintenance programmes . " 
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores national research system (Mexico) said that the vehicle is another important reason for the presence of the holes , so must the thickness of each class of the surface and in relation to the vehicle , and it must be ensured that is respected in order to prevent frequent blow holes this arrangement . 
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research at this stage , for example , about Asphaltemulsionen , which in other countries are already on the market , and with which the bumps repair clueless.Despite simply and without high temperatures .
