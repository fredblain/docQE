The worst female vices: what 's with you ? 
If you call the men , some typical female fights to shake , then they are all some promptly from the sleeves . 
The women , see you in the following lines , in which a few Unsitten review , which the men of the wallen ? 
Shopping addiction 
Accuses them her husband to be shopping addicted ? 
You have to buy at least one more week ? 
You like to go shopping and must be in actions; also a bit more ? 
Then it really in your case is a weakness . 
Some women are the least aware and try to keep their shopping a reasonably under control . 
But the truth is , what is it to bummeln not in search of a good sitting upper clothing only by a clothing business and equality; all (in all kinds of Farbkombinationen) try in the cab ? 
Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women , for the men it is often the pure hell . 
Think about it but , as often to her husband has already said - stick you would rather be outside ... 
Permanent discontent 
" I am not too fat ? " 
" I have to at least five kilos - should I start to go jogging or Gymnastik to make ? " 
" I liked you at all ? " 
Is familiar to them somehow ? 
Yes ? 
Then you will belong to the women , the obsession of this are , how they look . 
That does not mean that you go in , but many men respond allergic to when a wife are constantly on their appearance whinges . 
The greater gender is agree; - with rising frequencies; of the complaints are the women are unvertr√§glicher . 
Order and cleanliness in first place 
It is a fight against windmills . 
Page-window clean sweep , places and dust , scheuern the bath - and this at least twice a week . 
, with its partners , because he continues , with shoes on the clean places , chastise you the children , because it gescheuerte Waschbecken once again is bad and because the glass door in the living room cabinet once again fingerprints , which makes it the whitening so much trouble ? 
You should suffer from this kind of ' Devianz ' , then you should know that nothing can exaggerate and the order and cleanliness in family life cannot come first . 
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can ultimately mutual relations and above all quiet in the family . 
Antagonising 
" Dirty Turnhosen in the laundry basket . " 
" Do you want to run the old socks really attract again tomorrow ? " 
" A watery towel , not just on the floor . " 
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade , you should not be surprised that it brings to the Palme . 
Clearly this is not bad , they want to , but only the everything right . 
If the men knew this , then the women may not need so much to grumble . 
Gossip and novelty 
Some women and clap , Chen , as will getuschelt behind the backs or slander or be forging alliances . 
Women are now focused on relations , that is why they are to such issues by , for example - who , where , with whom , how and why . 
I think any of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and novelty to camps . 
Hand on heart , that is all women . 
This is not to confuse but with gossip aunts most calibre , which is nothing and nobody , the all around them , and are especially for women collective a considerable risk .
