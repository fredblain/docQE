Once again Valle del Cauca empty for the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia . 
This time had to be Melina Ramírez Serna content to be on the winners podium , a silver crown and the bond that they , as a new disproportions Colombia to make . 
With this the night they result in Cartagena , where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar , the 's Department at 14 disproportions title and Melina on the legion of women from Cauca del Valle , who had kept the crown almost in the hands of the proclaimed . Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leïla Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). 
The big question that there are many today is: What was missing ? 
Because the result is the demise of a big favorite , which had shown in every showing that they had everything to be the new Miss Colombia . Not for nothing that she was elected to the Queen of the police and the Mejor at Jolie of Vogue , title , which had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro , and took the crown of Miss Colombia with home . 
The first factor that is seen as crucial for the jury 's decision to appoint them to the first Miss , is that it has the answer to the question " what book you most and why ? ' , which affects their of Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria had Leamos , was not convinced . 
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied the author: 
" I read a lot , I think quite to the literature , I believe , it is a kind of ended , ultimately , I believe that the book , for my childhood most era--was , ' the small Prince ' is a very deep book . 
At the moment I read ' guilt and atonement . " It is a book of universal culture that we should read all I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski , a Russian , a wonderful book , ' passions ' . 
A response that was , firstly because of the term ' more civilised , ' and , secondly , because they had not declared , in what way each proposed book they had influenced . 
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result , " The universe is wise , it happens , what needs to be done . 
And for all people: read a bit ' The small Prince ' and it is a great book . 
Among other things , it is said that Nováky is the favorite of El Valle . 
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the measures , which are all Beifälle einheimste and in the run-up to get all the prices had (Gastronomie-Wettbewerb Oster , Publikumsabstimmung on the best handgeschneiderte matches and Reina Madre), " made the other candidates jealous , what the Queen stresste , which could therefore not shine on the stage . " 
And the said in her first speech to the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two lifts in the coronation ceremony . 
Although I am sure you in two , it lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico to window-dressing; . 
Ariel Osorio , a journalist of the programme " Como en casa " in the channel RCN , said that the fact that Melina been crowned Miss , " shows that the candidate , wins the most prices during the competition , will not ultimately Queen . " 
Was also Valle at the end of the press from the road - a mistake . 
Is a further hypothesis that could not convince the Valle Jurie on their interest in social work , which is the essence of the National beauty competition . 
There must be a reason that , two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty , they were a woman who stood up to the social affairs of their country . 
" Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia . We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social feeling , that she had already worked on projects from participation in the competition , " she said . 
There is speculation that Valle with its defects of the Derriere and fibrosis , which said it in the stomach area , had sinned , but it is inconsistent , because the jury , as a candidate for ' natural beauty , with a healthy body , good eating habits and good physical work . 
The coach of the queens , Jorge Hernán Orozco , admits that Melina did not have the best body that there would be better , " but their problem with the fibrosis belly , which was difficult for me to be honest to say , put their marks on the last day . " 
, meanwhile , is the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos that of the woman from defects; Valle del Cauca are the surgical intervention , which they have been . 
" The operations are OK , but Valle did not know how they do it right . 
Their body is never their strong side , and this job; they had to pay . " 
Because of this prize , which assesses the first time by the National beauty contest , emerged after the appearance in a cruel to forecast the in the night should be true , it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize , if they are not allowed to come in tax-neutrality crown . 
Whether this is true or not , the fact is that the inaugural Melina today the rule , not the Queen , but as a Princess , a position that it offers the opportunity to represent the appointment of the National Colombia; beauty competition in one of the international competitions . 
However , it will be as one of the queens , escaped the despite their overwhelming speech for Cartagena the crown was , in the history books .
