The threat is real 
After the discovery of " Zwickauer cell ' doubt Turkish media on German law . 
One paper even speaks of a " bloody ideology , " the now again auflebe . 
The murders of eight türkischstämmigen and a Greek micro-businesspeople in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing background . 
This news will react in Turkey and the Turkish German population in Germany with fear and concern . 
For many Deutsch-türken , a long totgeglaubtes specter back: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 , there has been no similar violence with extreme right-wing background more against Turks . 
That there is in Germany xenophobia; , was never in question . 
However , the right-wing extremist network , which have been uncovered proportions , whose dimension is not yet in sight . 
' , the bloody idealogy back on ? ' , the Internetausgabe the Turkish newspaper ran the headline " Haberturk . " 
The newspaper Sabah " stressed , however , that should have been one of the perpetrators of a V-Mann constitutional protection , and is concerned that could be involved , German authorities in the fascist-minded quagmire . 
The Turkish community responded , coolly Germany: you reminded over the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence . 
Only two weeks ago had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the deutsch-türkischen Anwerbeabkommens . 
In lively colors was the cooperation been set up - as a history of success . 
As a slap in the face , because the rapporteurship some Turkish media: " Germany 's gift for fifty TENs ' is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform " Haber X , " the report the background of the non-Muslim; series . 
Also Deutschlandausgabe ' Hürriyet ' it is not , take these intellectual link . 
" It start to stink , " is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci . 
He stressed that people have been murdered , paid the taxes and would have done with their work is an important contribution to the rebuilding of Germany . 
Extremely critical is being discussed in German Turkish Internet forums the actions of the police and the investigation later success . 
Why it was not long before the German authorities either , to search for suspects in extreme right-wing circles , surprised the authors . 
Some shows ready at least rhetorically to drastic measures: " Will done carelessly , remains the migrants; no choice than the self-defense and the weapons . " 
" This will be the best protect themselves . " 
" By the quality of education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the internal peace in Germany , " writes " selenium . " 
What it means , if the internal peace in Germany in danger , goal--such the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties . 
The photograph of the ruin of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish . 
Because no other event showed the Turks living here , it is clear that there is a current threat , and Germans--the that mistrust; and distance can result in right-wing violence . 
The attacks , but the Wir-Gefühls knives on the Turkish side . 
The mistakes of the past repeat 
In the Turkish press was criticised at the time , in particular , the failure of the German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln . 
After the fire attack in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President , represented at the funeral in Cologne but by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was on in his speech , as were many charges here the Turks . 
Quite so , than the value of a berechne people after the height of his taxation delivery . 
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again , is how deep distrust many German Turks in the European rule since then . 
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and reassessment of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs it this time , open-coordination words .
