Fire story: 
The innovator IBM enters its existence the second century 
Wanted to look for a suitable word that characterised the strategy of IBM most closely , that would be the word ' longevity . " 
IBM is a synonym for technological revolution to the general public , it is known as a modern companies , although since its inception a century has passed . 
The basis of this longevity , already presented its first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson H.W. 
Already he argued the slogan , countless were easily solve global problems , if the people were prepared to think a little bit . 
His slogan " think ! " Has been so for the trademark , for the life of the future giants should (and at the same time to the title of the internal magazine , which , in IBM in 1935). 
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture . 
" For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future . 
IBM survived and was also an entire century , because it has remained true to its principles and not hesitates to change everything else surrounding it . 
The allowed us , in the course of our first century , the technologies to transform the business and society . 
We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years , " said Samuel J. Palmisano , who is now director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary . 
Thought-out system 
Watson was already in the thirties socio-medical its employees - in a similar way , such as the Baa entrepreneurs in Czechoslovakia: the IBM-Leute had as one of the first American workers paid leave , insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a reasonable pay system for best innovators and traders . 
As more sophisticated are also of IBM long-term relationships with their customers . 
The company was from the outset in the brilliant talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world , on IBM any discrimination - and could decide accordingly . 
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan , will barely-existent the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty . 
Is already the thirty years with IBM , so far , the position of the Vetriebs- , marketing and strategy leader; . 
IBM makes so-called Online-Brainstormings in recent years , from where many future strategies and innovation . 
No wonder - ideas there are enough , the company is almost half a million people . 
An institution with a good reputation 
Their unwavering position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and this after within and outside . 
" From the outset , IBM , the concept of an institution , as a mere technology-producing company , " said the Economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM , Rosabeth Moss Kanter . 
" IBM is not a technology-producing companies , but a company , the business helps solve problems using technology , " added George Colony of Consulting-Firma Forrester Research . 
As the companies themselves , there is a difference , to be on the market only present or to shape it through this presence directly . 
Family called " Big Blue " for their logos IBM - in the States , is one of the largest companies in the world has come in a century . 
It is one of the most diverse technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software , infrastructure , hosting and consulting services in a broad product - of servers to nanotechnology . 
Of all the American technology companies has IBM most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize . 
To its most famous inventions include , for example , bank machines , credit cards , Finanzswap , bar code or the diskette . 
With approximately $ 220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) was IBM in this year 's second largest technology-producing companies (after Apple), and it took for the first time since 1996 , Microsoft . 
Looking ahead 
Not all products and innovations , the taste of the customers of today - were unhappy OS for example the attempt with its own operating system / 2 , the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr . 
' business is based on the forward movement , not tie it emotionell in the past , " said to Samuel J. Palmisano . 
Therefore has no problem IBM , its foundations to build on various platforms - and if they do not work , they have to leave . 
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft , with its Windows operating system stands and falls . 
Promising technologies 
To the factor- of IBM participate in great extent services , software and hardware to participate in a fifth . 
It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share . 
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit safest assets with a value of $ 15 billion , in the same time , however , $ 58 billion in the future technologies . 
In these investment continues IBM after 2008 , and saw the latter-day financial crisis for the first time as a storm on the world . 
Here , too , IBM was faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson , in the midst of the Great Depression its scale . 
So far , it seems that survives the company IBM today 's crisis unscathed . 
The value of the IBM-Aktien rose by 120 percent since 2008 raketenartig and the profit of the company productivity--the kontinuell . 
Is the corporate slogan of IBM: everything can change - not only the values . 
Also is to be expected that this flexible giant also the next crisis resolves .
