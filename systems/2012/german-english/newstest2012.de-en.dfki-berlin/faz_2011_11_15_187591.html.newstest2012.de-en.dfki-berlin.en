The scandal of the Bank Zürisee 
The abenteuerlichste Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France , but in Switzerland . 
The UBS in the financial crisis nearly bankrupt and slide since then from one crisis to another . 
Now it will be a German . 
So it is certainly not intended Axel Weber . 
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was leaked in July that he would take up a 2013 almost as spectacular new job: President of the Management Board of Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step . 
Axel Weber was publicly , praised the Switzerland; whether their beauty and the UBS over their newly acquired solidity and the1990 warm remarks about the future colleagues . 
" The UBS has the Turnaround managed . " 
" I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel . " 
But back in September , it was clear that everything would be quite different . 
A trader of UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and been around EUR 1,7 billion . 
Ubs-vorstandschef Oswald Grübel , not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers , had to go . 
The President of the Board of UBS , since , as has - and ask all: when will finally Axel Weber ? 
Was already known that Weber may discuss the Bank of February 2012 . 
And the board , he is already in May - not only in 2013 , as the bank said on Tuesday . 
For Axel Weber , the hard . 
It is not a banker , economics professor and central bankers and would have had a long time certainly needed . 
With a stroke , he takes then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank , which has once again demonstrated , that they have the title " biggest Skandalbank of Europe " deserves . 
Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and the slide for years by a scandal in the next . 
Nothing , it seems , is spared the once so proud Swiss bank . 
It started in the financial crisis . 
By 2007 , the UBS has had an excellent reputation . 
The image of the secretive and solid , but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters it had combined with ambitious objectives: you wanted to be in the investment banking a very large number . 
So the UBS managed 2007 with $ 1,6 trillion more money high-net-worth customers than any other bank in the world . 
And on the other hand it as investment bank in the League of the largest banks in the world . 
This made impression . 
Told the former bankers and later a professor banks in Zurich Hans right: " my students I have presented the UBS at the time as a model of good bank . " 
" Today , we wonder: how could I am wrong only ? " 
He wrongly huge . 
In 2007 , for the first time that something great schieflief in the UBS . 
In the middle of the year , Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising , who was by then as high intellectual and ingenious bankers . 
Some months later it was , how he had gone . 
The investment in the bank , with Subprime-Papieren been and had to write off billions . 
In order to shoulder the , the UBS announced a capital increase of as many as 13 billion francs . 
So it was actually investors , but which , on the gerümpft some until shortly before the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund , which was not the case that was not even his name . 
But that was only the first blow . 
It was worse in April 2008 . 
The Bank had to announce new billion losses , Board President Marcel Ospel , 2006 of the second best paid board of Switzerland , resigned . 
In October 2008 , following the disaster: the UBS was given their bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state . 
The National Bank , the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities , the Swiss Confederation , six billion francs for a forced change bond that they could be Miteigentümerin the Bank . 
The whole country was shocked , because she has said , as it is for a small country , if it so dramatically large banks . 
After all , the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic). 
" Once again , we could not save the UBS ' , says banks researchers right . 
On the first disaster subscribed to the second . 
A few months later surrendered in the UBS tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth clients , with the help of the bank had evaded taxes . 
Also agreed to a payment of $ 780 million - as a repayment unjustified profits from these shops and Strafaufschlag . 
So that doet the UBS more or less open , in the tax evasion . 
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secretiveness--rooted . 
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same . 
It followed the resignation of head and administration; Council President . 
And the exodus of customers ' money . 
Had lost the bank within a few months their credibility in two key business areas: in investment banking by the false speculation and in the asset management by the aid to tax evasion . 
And just as it has been somewhat calmer , just as it was thought , will now get the UBS it again , because this is unfortunate Händler-Geschichte: an individual traders been EUR 1,7 billion , before the bank , that something was wrong . 
And it seems to be: in the risk management in the investment banking works out there are obviously still not . 
" With the case Adoboli has to be said that has changed the risk control too little , " says Martin Janssen , an economist and professor at the Institute of the University of Zurich . 
Also the Finanzvorstand of a large German bank is sure of the UBS: " The problem is that they do not control , the risk control . " 
It was just the idea of caution , which were the Swiss bankers for a long time to be guardians of the great wealth of the world: not too many risks , and safety for money - was also collapse across the Alps of the world . 
The coffers of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate . 
The office of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of the excellent Swiss private bank - yet it is just a little bit bigger . 
The situation is classic; . 
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße , from the Central Station , directly to the Zürichsee , of the will of the Letná summits of the Swiss mountains frames . 
The buildings here are magnificent , , the shop rents are among the highest in Europe . 
Jewellers as Tiffany 's here between Swiss tradition , such as the Confiserie Sprüngli . 
Stay here for centuries the Swiss banks: by the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius bear . 
The reception of the Hemicycle UBS is through a revolving door . 
Are dressed in the marble walls , be thick leather chair , along with the logo of a great sign for " safe . " 
The UBS knows what the customer wants: security here . 
This idea of Swiss Bank have both big Swiss banks , UBS and Credit Suisse , has , however , eventually betrayed - or , as the head of a small Swiss private bank . 
His name he would rather not read in the newspaper , finally , he , like all Swiss bankers , also deals with the two big banks . 
The UBS has become far too big , he - especially in investment banking , where would spread the Anglo-Saxons . 
The Swiss have nothing more to say . 
" And if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons . " 
Indeed , it was the Anglo-saxon investment banking , which changed the UBS , its only high profits , and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost in the Subprime-Dschungel as much money as the Swiss large bank . 
On 15 October 2008 , the disaster was visible . 
" On that Wednesday , the coalition government of the seven million small country the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation , " writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book " The UBS-Crash . " 
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros approved the politicians , in order to save the bank before the bankruptcy . 
How could this happen ? 
When you talk with Swiss bankers , so they see the problem , in the size of the UBS . 
In June 1998 , up two of the three big Swiss banks to a huge company . 
It was a bank , which has been in the merger was too large for the small Switzerland; - and further and further grew up . 
It helped that the two different Vorläufer-Banken supplemented the UBS: a rich , but verschlafene bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer , but even more internationalized . 
Suddenly the globalised investment banker favourable much money , with which it is a huge wheel . 
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli , president of the UBS from 2001 to 2007 , and Marcel Ospel , the chairman of the board at the time . 
" I always thought , Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team , " says banks researchers Hans right . 
" Wuffli , the intellectuals , Bescheidene who understands a lot of models and statistics , and Ospel belly , the person who has worked , from the bank lesson to the top . " 
But Ospel have ended up on Wuffli . 
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: " He thought that his models were the reality , " says sound right . 
" This is a tragic case . " 
Tragic , perhaps . 
It is clear: embolden came before the fall . 
The UBS remember clearly to the Führungskräfte-Meetings on which to group chief Wuffli always have the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone . 
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world . 
It was the " League Tables ' , the rankings , which documented the success of the banks that time . 
Then wanted to UBS , after at the top . 
Some steps were in it . 
In the foreign exchange and stock in trade , with it at the top . 
Business advisers who have been charged , stressed , however , a weakness: the international interest in business , the bankers , " Fixed Income , " there is a huge gap to the largest banks . 
The UBS have gaps in US mortgage products . 
In order to close this gap , UBS in an adventure , which they almost cost the existence . 
Hungry for growth , both the Bank and invested a newly-established hedge funds in American Subprime-Anlagen before it . 
It has become a huge machine , the securities on American mortgage loans packaged and , post-Napoleonic - but it also risks . 
Also , as were other banks for the exit . 
" Even in the summer of 2007 , when the American property market in flames , has bought the UBS there , " says banks expert; right . 
So great the euphoria , so deeply the case . 
A manager after another had to go as compared with the attempts organization--one more difficult . 
Items in the UBS were the weapon and are still shaky . 
Who the bank now , has an almost impossible job . 
He needs to find a strategy for a bank of all nearby business models are strangely . 
Banks researchers right already has an idea: stop the investment banking , focus on asset management , return to the Swiss roots . 
The bank will not (yet) go quite so far . 
But the investment-banking activities should shrink sharply , it is already clear . 
On Thursday to present the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy . 
The 51 -year-old Italo-Schweizer was intended only as a temporary solution , and divided the Bank is surprising of predecessors; Grübel . 
Now authoritarian-would-be-democratic it: it is the business of UBS , told the Zurich Bank on Tuesday . 
Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the level in the mid-1990s . 
3500 posts cut it . 
This will not be enough . 
The UBS needs a vision . 
Who is it ? 
What do they earn money ? 
Those are the questions that is Axel Weber safe; now . 
Publicly he says so far , only that he would seek with his wife in a home in Zurich . 
Next year .
