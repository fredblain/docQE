Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health legislation , as a court case over-accepting 
On the day of the Supreme Court behind closed doors to discuss the political part of the question as to whether it will hear a challenge to the health legislation by President Obama , two of its judges , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , part of a dinner , which was of the firm gesponsort that will take the case to court . 
The incident took place last Thursday , and met all nine judges to a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration . 
One of the cases was a complaint , the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care , which were decided last year by Congress , a law that has been in the conservative activists everywhere in the US the catchphrase . 
The judges agreed to the hearing in March and is expecting a 5 1 / 2 -hour basis for discussion , which probably the result will probably increase the presidential campaign of 2012 , at the time , which will give the court decision , will be in full swing . 
The lawyer who will argue in court , and that is to overturn the law , will probably be Paul Clement , once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush . 
Clements Office; , Bancroft PLLC , was one of the nearly two dozen companies , which supported the annual dinner of the Federal society , an ancient group , which the defence non-socialist legal principles . 
Another company , which represents the dinner has sponsored , Jones Day , one of the business , the National Federation of Independent Business , the challenge the law . 
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc . , which is involved in the outcome of the process . 
The dinner was a few hours after the court deliberated on the case , in a Washington hotel . 
Service , among other things , Mitch McConnell , the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health reform 
The guests of the dinners ? Scalia and Thomas . 
This is nothing new: the two judges visit events organised by the Federal society for years . 
And it is not against moral rules . 
In fact , to judge by the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts . 
They were , they would probably fall within principle 4 c of the code , which states: " A judge can participate in the near fundraising law and other organisations , with the judge not a spokesperson , Khadaffi or according to programme must not be a guest of such events . " 
Nevertheless , the extreme near Scalia and Thomas to two of the case with the related firms , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this , in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten . 
" This startling break with morality and the contrast with the code of the complaints of some judges lie , the court is to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , " said Bob Edgar , president of the common cause-célèbre , a civil rights movement in the United States . 
" The judges , and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending procedure on court . " 
Their presence and their support of a fundraising effort for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are not acceptable . 
Scalia and Thomas show little respect for critics who say that they would court matter too easily with groups that are off the agenda , such as the Federal society; mix . 
And the Thomas ' wife Ginni is a known conservative activist . 
However , the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan , who have a moral problem , not Scalia and Thomas . 
Kagan was General prosecutor under the Obama administration , as the first legal challenges in the first instance in court . 
Their critics , Kagan , withdraw itself from the hearing of the case because of bias , since it is very committed to the defence of the law , in order to be impartial . 
Kagan is not about to do so .
