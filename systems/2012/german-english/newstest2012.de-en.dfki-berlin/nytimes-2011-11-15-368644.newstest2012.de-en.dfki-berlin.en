Mass slaughter on a personal level 
Begins sensitive and generous Peter Englunds new book ' beauty and horror . Told a story of the First World War , in nineteen giants ' with a long list of players , the anticipate--a to heart . 
This is a piece of advice that could be as: Cut from this side of you and make you to read your sign . 
They are these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative to know each other very well , and these players will be your GPS function , as a beacon in just a few moments , in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and your illusions . 
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist . 
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy to win the Nobel Prize for literature . 
He has written an unusual book , which he does not , describes as " a work of the Anti-Geschichte " inappropriate . 
It contains only a few big names , major contracts or miracle-working battles , there is little ambassadors , racing reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment . 
It is less a book on what happened , he says , but rather " a book about how it was . " It is about " feelings , impressions , experience and moods . " 
" Beauty and horror " almost the war experiences of 20 more or less discreet men and women on both sides of the war , of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountain increase , doctors , ambulance drivers and office workers . 
Some of these people to be heroes . 
Some will lose to prisoners of war , be born , crazy or die . 
Each of these lives future has come as the Votivkerzen in a church , some , while another lapse . 
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books . 
It is also the idea that the first world war was just the devastating war , on the west front . 
" Beauty and horror ' is with experts view of other war theaters: the Alps , the Balkans , the Ostfront , Mesopotamia , East Africa . 
To the soldiers in this book , bee-related baskets , is celebrating Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt , Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem . 
This is almost from the outset a moving book . 
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster , like a hurricane; Katrina , the smells of the Kordit . 
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with their children , and cannon fire in the distance . " You or you take the flight ? 
Who is at all ? 
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war is being waged at all . 
" Lack of facts , " Englund finds , " were on assumptions assumptions , hopes , fears , hare-brained ideas , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumours contribute . " 
" Beauty and horror " of individuals such as Florence Farmborough , an English nurse in the Russian army , and Richard root , a young German ship sailors . 
Their stories have been Africa-centric memories , letters and other already (material removed . 
Their life reports can be shocking or simple , but they are very alive in Englunds details in the possession of small moments . 
Many of them act of shortages and aban Behelfen . 
In the history of a German Schulm√§dchens he is telling: " replacement , substitute everywhere . " 
' replacement aluminum coffee , wrong , wrong eraser , paper , wood buttons . " 
He tells more of the replacement eat in Germany . 
He describes ' meat , which made large rice and was struck in Hammelfett (and least was served with a false bone from wood), tobacco , which was made from dried roots and dried and potato , shoes , which were besohlt with wood . " 
It was , as he noted , " In 837 , spare funds , which were allowed in the manufacture of sausages , 511 registered coffee spare resources . " 
Some stories act of honour and bravery . 
An American recognises his own drive to the ferocity and says about the war: " We feel that this is in spite of everything , rather than for men , was to sit in the Lehnstuhl , with the evening , or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand , and to do so , as is such a veneer of civilisation and there would be no barbarism behind its own strengthened and keeper shirt breast . " 
Conversely , acknowledges a British soldier that he probably die and nobody notice or would be done . 
" If one of the idea to sacrifice themselves , , we would like to think that this is happening in front of a crowd , " he writes . 
Instead , it is so terrible as " a convicted man who was hanged in secret . " 
Other observations of the old Europe act , which does not fall apart , and on new kinds of terror . 
" The conflict was becoming an increasingly economic competition , " Englund writes , " a war between the factories . " 
He starts the arrival of what he calls " a new species in the Bestiarium of young century ' , ' the word streamlined and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick , the slaughter , while he is sitting behind a desk . " 
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is also frivoles behaviour as heroic . 
Englund is the soldiers who were actively being infected with a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease , in order to escape the front . 
" The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade with Gonokokken-Eiter , because soldiers and on their genitals grease , in the hope that , come to the hospital , " he writes . 
" Those who were really desperate , rieben him in the eyes , which led to the rest of their lives they were blind . " 
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves will Englunds versemongering elastic and intrusiveness and fits in perfectly with his human task . 
In dozens of small scenes is he the kind and a way , as the war " has a unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred . " 
The people are starting to ask why their leaders they bring to the fighting . 
The best books about the First World War were distorted as Paul Fussells ' Great War and Modern Memory " or novels like Erich Maria Remarques " nothing new " in the West as extensive history books . 
Englunds band is an unconventional Ruhmeshalle . 
His book has the most devastating end , of which I have ever read in a Sachbuch . 
There is no longer tells me . 
But it is as if he snapped up with his book this side of the main people in the face and lit with a coup--Nigeria wood .
