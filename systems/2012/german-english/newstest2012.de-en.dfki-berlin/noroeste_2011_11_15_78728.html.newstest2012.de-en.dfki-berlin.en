A minority of four ministers , including the President of the Supreme Court , Juan Silva Meza , was of the opinion that the President Felipe Calderón was exceeding its powers not when he decree-law with the details of the switching to the terrestrial digital TV . 
With this decision , the constitutional struggle launched by the Senate was rejected for lack of a qualified majority of eight votes , so that the court could determine the constitutionality or the Nicht-Verfassungsmäßigkeit . So the law remains in force .
