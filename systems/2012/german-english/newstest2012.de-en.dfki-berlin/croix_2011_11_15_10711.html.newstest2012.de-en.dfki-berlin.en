Why the unemployment rate remains of disabled persons to such a high level ? 
Is about 19% of people with disabilities to search for a job . 
Today is the 15 th week of work for the disabled . " " 
Despite a determined public policy , which was introduced in 2005 , is the unemployment rate for disabled people always twice the average average:19% to 9% of the total population problem . 
Discouraging ? 
" No , overstated; Civil Blanchet , Director General of the Association Adapt , the " week of work for people with disabilities " . " 
" The within fifteen years progress are considerable . " 
" When the unemployment rate was not twice , but three times as high . " 
" Although there is still an enormous amount of work to do . " 
It must be said , however , that persist for disabled people unemployed many obstacles remain before they get a job . 
Are also increasingly it is the elderly:37% (17%) on average more than 50 years old . 
They have a low level:80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10.000 were disabled persons under the 2,3 million students . 
Finally , is also the long-term unemployment very widespread:53 in the disability compared to 38% in the average . 
In short , there are so many criteria , the Arbeitseinstieg again , and the " heart of the problem , " Christian Grapin , Director-General of Tremplin , a group founded in 1992 , the company is helping disabled workers . 
So much for the factual brakes . 
Remains the underlying implication that develop , which , of course , but slowly . 
A in April by the Association for the IMS-Entreprendre magazine La Cité study stated , the managers of " a weak level of knowledge about disabled people , " the " over-represented " " of people in wheelchairs , mentally or intellectually less well-off . " 
Result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go to the Anstellungsziel from 6% disabled people , which was in a law of 1987 , to reach . 
This last-mentioned , from 2008 , figures point to a ratios of 2,6% . 
" We are now in the 3% reported , " Pierre Blanc , Director-General of Agefiph , the organisation , which is charged with recovering , contributions from companies that do not respect the law . 
The proof that the number " fees; zahlender " plants has been reduced , as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 , zahlenmäig from 59.000 to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros). 
" The law of 2005 , which increased contributions , created a strong pressure on businesses , said Pierre Blanc . " 
" But this improvement is also a real recognition , particularly in the groen firms groups ' . 
According to the Ministry of Labour , only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 workers--those disabled workers , businesses with 100 to 199 staff in 82 .
