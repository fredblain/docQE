Immigration is burden--if or opportunity for the economy ? 
, as France has had a change of Nicolas Sarkozy 's immigration policy has been criticised for many corners - congestion of police , judicial and administrative bodies of policy on the basis of the figures , reconcilability this policy with the status of a " country of human rights . " 
Recently had the against foreign students of official harassment of the weeks , the Interior Minister had it (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France " no talent , have Masonic-style or waiter from abroad needed; . " 
But this policy was analysed rarely from an economic point of view . 
On this issue , there is a wide consensus between right and left . 
Of right-wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac , 1976 , had declared that " 900.000 people unemployed , including about 2 million immigrant workers , should be not a problem for a country ' , of Manicheanism side by Michel Rocard , 1990 , France " could not accommodate all the poverty of the world . " 
The only difference is the level of Groβzügigkeit 
The fear of invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005 on both the right and the left . 
By both camps , the immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and the French society . 
The only difference is the extent of the Grozügigkeit , is to be the immigrants to willing . 
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme on the banalities , point out , EC-Morocco development would like it , " our migration problems to solve . 
This idea of immigration as a burden , as a problem , can possibly have an effect on the elections; however , it is economically costly . 
As we consider the economic experts Ian Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work that combines the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Our World Shaped migration and does Define Our Future , May 2011 , Princeton University Press , 352 S.), is among the specialists; a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth , jobs and wages in the immigration; countries . 
The immigration would limit the growth of damage and the labour market situation . 
The fears of the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that this threat , the local workforce , particularly the less qualified to replace , by exercising pressure on their wages . 
Experience shows , however , that the immigrants in truth complementary are as much as the local wage workers , because they have schwerpunktmäig professions in sectors that are work technically unausgelastet . 
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that attract the local wage workers , the better the immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which is a result of inadequate training the labour supply . 
Positive wage effect 
Also would have as a surgeon , to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten , does this complementarity between locals and migrants a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation . 
Giovanni Peri in this way has calculated that a 1% disabled person rise in flood miteinbezogene , long-term increase in wages between 0,6% and 0,9% herbeiführe . 
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the Ideenschöpfung tabled by the immigrants and the economic growth (high proportion naturalized -immigrants under American Nobel laureates; from Google , Intel , Paypal , eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). 
The migrants are also net to the social systems , in European countries , on average , for a total of 1% of the total budget . 
The International Labour Organisation estimates , for example , that a at the age of 30 years after Germany sea person the public budget on average about his life a net contribution (revenue less spending), of the 150.000 euro . 
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate the lack of average points " with the teeth . " 
These said teeth , which the immigrants should be , achieved just the opposite effect .
