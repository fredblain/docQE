The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again , there is a stalemate . 
Almost five months , the Czech football and there is no chairman that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will be known . 
Until today , there is still no agreement , after the electoral law . 
And this is no vote on the three potential successor . 
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík . 
In June Hašek resigned his role , and he asked his colleagues in the departure had to come together and to find a strong personality , which could lead the football in the future . 
Only in the era of Hašek , from the old squabbles between the two chambers Association , which are unable to agree on a joint candidate . 
This was very clearly on 16 September , should be chosen as the new chairman . 
The delegates of the main assembly; euro-egoism free of charge to Public House in Prague Smíchov quarter , because the negotiations led to a result and it was not only about the election itself . 
We could not agree is about who is in the full collection actually vote - only the statutes representatives or even with the full power of officials . 
In this single point it was at least partly agreement , which also helped the recommendation of the Institute for government and legal , whose opinion is not a representation at full power base . 
The divergencies in order the electoral law , however , continue to take . 
The Executive Committee did not bring more clarity in the matter , part-sessions , whether regular or extraordinary - is in principle nothing else on the agenda . 
Even if the opinions in a couple of times about the election changed - the worst point remained the same . 
The question is: how do we proceed in the 3 th round , in order to avoid a stalemate ? 
" The issue is the question whether or not to be in accordance with the constitution , or whether we need to find a different model , " said Duan Svoboda , one of the three deputy chairman of the ex-FAR , who represents in the management of the professional football . 
According to a registered model candidate who prevails in the third round of the greater as support in the chamber , for which he stood . 
Moravia is supposedly ready to compromise , that the one candidate prevails , which the higher number of votes from both chambers . 
The Czech side again , on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote count receives at least a two-thirds majority . 
" We have the two Vorrunden make no sense , this method would put the entire two Chamber; concept in question , " Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side , it would be the best , not tweaking the electoral law , but to choose under current rules . 
Agrees with surprisingly also Tomáš Paclík , even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely to Pelta . 
" It is my wish that , as far as possible after the statute is elected . " 
" It could be a nonsensical replacement options , such as at the last general meeting , " said the owner of the (football clubs) Victoria Plzeň , the candidates for the first time and abgrenzte in his opinions in particular Pelta . 
Pelta but remains optimistic . 
His opinion , in Nymburk the new chairman will be known and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future . 
" The possible qualifications of the national team for the Championships today would certainly contribute to calm the emotions . " 
" If the football until the euphoric wave ride them , then it is also the willingness to cooperate , " the official says Jablonec larger , by all three Adepten the most experience and this is both at a professional , and regional level . 
Rajchl is restrained . 
" I hope for an agreement , but the situation is unfortunately is ambivalent . " 
" This is not a matter between the people in Bohemia and Moravia , but there are some efforts , the rules to own purposes " officialdom . " " 
" That is why a new on the general meeting not excluded . " 
" However , I hope that common sense prevails in the end , " said Rajchl . 
Only - there is not much time to the agreement of all sides left . 
Some negotiations should be supposedly directly in Montenegro , but who knows , maybe the Fußballgeneralität until its qualification will be completely at all . 
The charter plane , with the should fly , among other things Dalibor Kuera and Rajchl after Podgorice , was not in the morning in Prague because of a technical problem , and so was urgently for a replacement variant , how to be a part of the executive committee but to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels . 
In the end it is surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level , to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday . 
Josef Dobe , the minister for education , youth and physical education have divided the parties within the biggest sports ' of the country to an agreement . 
There is a lot at stake: government grants , the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of the ČSTV , the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction . 
Paclík in the fight for the position of Chairman , because he sees no suitable candidates 
If Tomáš Paclík , the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting a strong candidate to represent , all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAR) have been met , he would have been not to the fight for the top position . 
" If there was a good candidate , then I would fight for it and give up on the election . " 
" But in the current situation , we did not succeed in such a Adepten to find , " said Paclík ČTK . 
The main reason for Paclík , into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl to go , it is to prevent the pseudo-developmental favorite of the election , Pelta , at the top of the FAČR . 
Paclík also stresses that he only if he wins the role of the chairman intends to exercise a year , until 2013 , until the date of the proper general meeting . 
In the position of the chairman would have liked it to be a " golden parachutes , " the Russia--at is not too much in the football . 
" With some in question people I have spoken personally . " 
" Hard to believe that I have some said they were currently not identify with the Czech football . 
" Such views would have liked to have changed , " he quoted . 
Most of all is Paclík supposedly the link Pelta 's with the chairman of the Pilsner district Football Association Berbr novel , a man with kontroversem reputation , which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist , with the ability to influence delegated votes in general meetings . 
It is for this reason for Paclík unacceptable , that Pelta holds the position of the chairman . 
" In his victory would become of einkonserviert and in the Czech football is not it at all . " 
" The support of Berbr , a cleverem Businessman , would get the football pollero twice , " said Paclík . 
It is he , too , that Pelta ' was 's name some time ago in connection with the investigation of corruption in a case , from the Pelta but go unpunished . 
" I do not know what Prestige; a victory of Pelta (tsch .) football should get involved . " 
" And where would we be in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA , " said ekl Paclík , its former said , " it will sell the Pilsner football club , when will Pelta chairman ' , but something more . 
Should win Paclík in Thursday 's election , he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta . 
Just as another candidate thinks - Rajchl , had supported the Paclík before the general meeting in October , which ended with a fiasco . 
" He (Pelta) would be the first , to which I would go . " 
" He has great skills . " 
" I could imagine him well for example as head of the national team . " 
" But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager . " 
" It is not my nose but in matters , which I understand nothing , " said Paclík , who had been in September for attention that he was behind the recall of referee Commission with Luk Macela at the top , replacing the Dagmar Damková . 
Paclík claims , it is equal to the role of the group leader . 
And holding up his skills in the direction of private companies , since last summer , he is also head of Pilsen , the celebrated with his support in May the first triumph in the League . 
" I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to the cultivation of this . " 
" In order to limit the influence of interest groups , tend to the disciplinary and influence of commissions , which in turn to II; situations , " led to Paclík , which makes no secret of its antipathy for example to the Sparta-Chef Daniel Ketínský . 
As one of its priorities would be the establishment of the relations between the ex-FAR and the Czech Olympia-Komitee , with which he would save in the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in the sport . 
" This is one of the key things that should devote itself to the new chairman . " 
" When it comes to taxation of gambling , and declare the political parties , then I understand their reasoning , we have to say it but also very clearly where the money goes , " he said . 
Its connection to the Pilsner club does not Paclík also as a handicap , although he emphasised , the chairman of the ex-FAR " bipartisan " . 
, in turn , is associated with Jablonec pelta Rajchl with the Prague Dukla . 
" It is not ideal . " 
" It is not my opinion but also make much sense to transfer my stock in the Pilsner club hypocritical to a third person to return after a year and a half years , " said Paclík clear . 
Pelta promised new statutes of the ex-FAR , the ausschlössen a stalemate in the future . 
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association , one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt , Miroslav Pelta promised he would if elected , that the FAČR new statutes that disputes over the electoral law , rule out in future . 
The official from Jablonec believes is before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk confident and that the campaign would modest.They in any success of the Czech selection . 
Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September , he wants to focus on his election to the national team and the collection of funds . 
He decided only at the last moment , to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so was the two-month break help him to defend his ideas about the running of football and in a broader context . 
" People at all levels to address the football , they are impatient and therefore expect that know the chairman on Thursday . " 
" He feels that it is high time that the Association is led by someone , the man who believes in particular is linked with the Jablonecer club , but also many years in Sparta and the executive committee . 
Also , he has said that it had sufficient experience , in order to lead the Czech football . 
He is convinced that is for today 's problems with the election of the euphoria that was at the time of Ivan Hašek . 
" Unfortunately have been approved by the General Assembly in June statutes , which were not completely , as it had adopted all . 
If they had not allowed different interpretations , from September , " said Pelta had a chairman . 
Just the revision of the most important document of the residents ' association he used as a sweetener for the delegates . 
" Should I be chairman , then I take it personally and I am prepared to take personal responsibility , if it does not work . " 
" It is a matter of principle , without which he could not be , " said Pelta . 
In addition , he is not trying to differentiate themselves from his opponent . 
He had announced earlier , it could be a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl , recognizes the for its legal education , and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy . 
Also Tomáš Paclík , he has been for a long time , which , in turn , no dry thread Pelta the1990 . 
In football it can more than a year ago and is already moving with some success . " 
" But its attacks were herabsetzend and many people were very shocked by his election campaign . " 
" Also addressed now many doubt his true nature , " Pelta remain faithful to his opponent , probably the Caribbean-basin repeating proclamations , which he said in September . 
His opinion , its biggest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions , to the national team . 
And this should be the flagship Czech football . 
" I would try to end all Affairen - from the issue Bohemians , to the halls of the corruption scandal last year . " 
" Then , would lead to negotiations with the private and public sector in order to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football , " said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate TK two months ago . 
At that time , he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football no human cleansing; would mean . 
" I had to make myself with the content of all employees familiar , " he said in Strahov , where there is because of the long anarchy; understandably nervous . 
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios , which accompany the forthcoming general meeting , he believes that the delegates on Thursday will not go to Nymburk in vain . 
" If there really should be the only point of contention , as you choose in the third round , then we will be over . " 
" The football needs credibility and win back only when he finally has a new Leader ' , Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day its official career optimistic . 
Rajchl promises that to work the ex-FAR below him hard begins 
If should be elected the ViceChairman Jindich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic , would supposedly feeding frenzy that many people in the group the whim . 
Rajchl promises that , if elected , to work hard . 
He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual Fußballbereiche . 
Also promised to resolve the case Bohemians , relations with the UEFA and FIFA to put more money into the football and will continue the work that has begun the previous presiding Ivan Hašek . 
" As chairman , I would like to dwell on the football as a whole . " 
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA , on the national selection , the professional football , to the performance of football for the youth . " 
" This is not to say that I want to do everything alone , " said Rajchl in talks for ČTK . 
" I am a team player and would like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee in such a way that is devoted to each member a certain area . " 
And I will distribute hard tasks , so that the football in every segment with twelve-mile steps . " 
Mafias; many would not just delighted , because they , rather than the work of other to criticise , now even to work really hard , " he added . 
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered not to stand at all . 
" I know that I am working 20 hours a day . " 
" But I must know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me , not me constantly stick; between the legs and every step that I make , calling into question , " he said as an explanation as to why he has hesitated . 
" However , many people have told me that I should not give up , because it would otherwise also others do . " 
" It is confidence , we must not squander it , " he said . 
Supposedly motivated him to be able to continue the work , which he has begun between Hašek . 
I now " in two years , we have dealt with a great deal of work and this is not simply throw . " 
" It has been launched processes , the only in a few years to come and I would hate to see that it is painful , " he said , and that his concerns that , in the event that the other candidate - would be elected Mr Pelta , could return to the situation in the days before Hašek . 
" I believe in systematic approach and this is something that Mirek Pelta not brings . " 
' behind him , especially people who would make the football so that it would be only for chosen as ' . 
I think I can , but not a lot that I would be biased . " 
" I try to be objective . " 
" I want football for all , because it all goes well and not only of the candidates , " said Rajchl . 
It also rejects the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs . 
" Even if some people say the opposite , I really don 't have to do what is best for Moravia . " 
" For example , it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and Moravian part , whose winners in each of the first League felt . " 
" Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league , particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem , " Rajchl says . 
Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík has joined the battle for the role of the chairman , dares Rajchl not to estimate the chances that he will be elected . 
" I have a strong support in the Czech Chamber , which has been elected to her deputy chairman and now realises that clear successes are behind me , " led to Rajchl , which includes the savings of tens of millions of kroner for unfortunate contracts , the agreement of Fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success . 
On the other hand , it is partly blamed for the fact that the Association is not a single thing . 
While he Pelta says , ' he was disqualified from the outset , to bring greater confidence to the Czech football ' , he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate , of the football really have something to offer . 
" No one can call into question , that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year . " 
" He should be elected , then he would continue the things that has taken Hašek Ivan and also the personnel in the commissions would not change it , obviously . " 
It would make things certainly not altered just want , " ruling in its favour Rajchl on his rivals .
