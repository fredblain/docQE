The world gemäβ of Republican presidential candidates 
Mitt Romney , Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and ignorance about China , Iraq , and the support for Israel . 
Can a crisis weakened America a complex world with simple , not to say: stupid ideas ? 
If you are listening to the Republican presidential candidates , the voters could almost get that impression . 
For the last few days , Mitt Romney , Herman Cain , Rick Perry and their fellow-campaigners thundering statements , and their statements on the Auβenpolitik , traditional republikanischem focus , consistently reported . 
On China , Iran and the Israel; aid - has often in any way - slogans . 
In terms of the appointment of the " Grand Old Party " Mitt Romney in the course before the WTO , the Chinese and the ' currency manipulation ' - to quote leading issue in America , by the migration of entire industries to Asia Äuβerste prickly is - to accuse . 
Stupid , if this is to the introduction of a trade war imply , he said . 
Jon Huntsman , a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auenpolitik , has paid nearly about his schmeichelnden the emotions of the air . 
He had a solid , but constructive talks exchange with Beijing (also the current position Obama 's). 
But Huntsman will not be heard , because he is stuck in the depths of the polls . 
Reagan 's image 
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran , if not the sanctions on the halting of the nuclear programme . 
" If I am elected , I leads Iran ' , had on it . 
" Obama re-elected , will they get the bomb . " 
Auerdem he has promised military aid to Israel and accused Obama of this partner; commitments to guilty . 
The entrepreneur Herman Cain , second most platzierter candidate , for its part , is a shameful acts ignorance . 
Recently called on it to give the Chinese military threat against , as Beijing " trying to develop a nuclear power " - and the fact auer seemed to eight that China is already since 1964 in possession of nuclear weapons . 
The Texas governor Rick Perry , which supports Israel and military action against Iran , äuβert , to be prepared , for its part , the American army against drug cartels in service to take in Mexico . 
Obama 's 2009 re-application of Foltermanahmen to mutmalichen terrorists was also of Cain , Perry and the Kandidation Michele Bachmann . 
It is far from John McCain , the Republican candidate in 2008 , a auβenpolitischen heavyweight . 
In the current presidential opponent , Reagan had also simple ideas and despite all that won the Cold War . 
They call in memory , that Obama is selbstein amateur and water in our wine , with the issue of anti-terrorist . 
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve Zwiegespräches with Iran , the hasty withdrawal of its " boys " from Iraq , his indecision in Libya , which he also the reputation of the weakness . 
This is not , however , quite so freely hostility . 
The population estimates rather the positive outcomes of the National security under Obama , Bin Laden has switched off . 
Since the Iraq are not about military intervention , which lead to paralysis . 
And Obama surprised adequate , he argues , America must be rebuilt economically , in order to give its leadership to life .
