Europe 's most beautiful pools 
Leap in the dark 
Julie Stanek 
Planschbecken in Ufo-Optik , Prunkpools in Budapest , who travels through Europe , can be blue miracle - and , after a town-twinning Tour or undermine the tired feet in Sprudelbädern . 
A book shows , where called in the water is the most beautiful . 
If Meder Iris , in the last one and a half years on research , could not have one in their luggage: her bathing suit . 
Rücklings on the water , it was high in art was fully domes , they swam to Marmor-Putten , the basin , they were , and , on Jugendstilschwimmhallen meticulously restored . 
It was a bad , they have in their note book - and know values; details about the design and history of the building . 
More than 200 pools fact-finding architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now , in their book " bathing , ": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich , historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest , " Hardcore-Betonbauten " in the region . 
By 13 countries , their ' trip to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe ": as well as Germany , Austria and Switzerland , they visited places in Italy , France , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Slovenia , Hungary , Romania , Poland - and each year a city in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia . 
The 46 -year-old German is a real Badekultur-Enthusiastin . 
With sport they do not have much to everybody says Meder - only in the water is different . 
Annoying that must come to terms with Schwimmfans blue Kacheln and chlorine smell , while betörenden exceeds the smell of Fichtenwäldern inhale or can listen to happy already in the park . 
" I asked me one day , why must be swimming pools are always so ugly , " says the Meder living in Vienna . 
" So I started to collect fine pools . " 
Water surface doubled architecture 
Geplätscher leap in the basin and essential Sauna-Öle - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great , because of all the way , so Meder . 
And if have given the builders , can be a real Schwimmhallen Augenschmaus: " instead of the soil has been in bathrooms a surface water . " 
" It is transparent , reflects on the other hand , but the beauty of the whole building . " 
Everything doubled look better: high vaults , colorful Kacheln , leap . 
The kleinformatige picture collar; " bathing , " given to 190 pages of value on the architectural and cultural history historic Wellness-Oasen - but above all , to a leap in the dark . 
Remarkable copies the Pool-Sammlerin discovered Meder her research in Hungary . 
In addition Heilbädern magnificent as the 100 -year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest was a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a Thermalbad , are filled with alkalihaltigem basin of water and are in a flaschenförmigen buildings (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény). 
Spectacular prospects , however , offer many districts Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria , while we have the Zurich Dachbad the whole city , can look in the external pool of Bads in St Anton on the snow covered am - and Dampfbad: there is a window , which can be seen on the activities of the Ski-Piste . 
Perhaps the most extraordinary Pool-Design expected bathing guests in French-beating field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo . 
From three to above--relatively open parings dampft it in the winter , while in the background , the mountains of Ötztals stand out in the sky . 
Alhambra in the Black Forest 
Not in any swimming pool , the Pool-Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose . 
Many thermal spas smell of sulphur , in Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba smells it so strong for fuel oil that believes it is difficult , ended up in a bad health . 
The smell of the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen medicinal waters , is almost dark and whose silt in the skin , as soon as we can be - a Wellness-Erlebnis slip into the basin of the special . 
In one place was Iris Meder in their search for fine bathing sites but also disappointed: When they the freedom and some in the Czech bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit , it was a abgesperrtes terrain . 
The 1902 of architects Duan Jurkovic was bad was closed . 
As Meder threw a look through the window of the verwitterten red and white , yellow Jugendstil-Gebäudes , grown and grown like Topsy between the places . 
The decline has been countered , however , in the same beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in bad Wildbad . 
Three Inntal has this bad already behind , to discover not only neoromanische elements , from the time of its creation in 1844 , but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-Stil , which was added in 1900 . 
Since the careful 1995 modernisation is the Palais Thermal the favourite of the bad Pool-Kennerin Iris Meder - and not only because they originated in the Black Forest . 
" It is quite an achievement , so different Baustile to such a great unity to merge , " Meder says . 
In such a palace is the Tauchgang in Thermalpool apparently only incidental .
