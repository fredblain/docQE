The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the aircraft accident , in which the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people died . 
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y transport - SCT (Secretariat-General for communications and transport in Mexico), that the results of the accident , in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people , point out that the helicopters with all its intact structure directly against the ground , without the pilot an emergency landing could take . 
At a press conference mentioned Dionisio Pérez Jácome , secretary for communications and transport , that would have confirmed the pilot before the start , the weather conditions were suitable for the flight . 
" The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 metres of contact with trees , and lost the helicopter the rump , seems to indicate that the helicopters had several contacts soil . " 
He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 , which is why he met all the requirements for the transport of the staff . 
He also said that in the investigations in the area , the machine on the decrepit , was not Hubschrauberteile were found . 
" In the search , no aircraft parts found in other places , the surcharge was the whole structure . 
The helicopter was built for 19 , which is why he met all the requirements for the passengers . 
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees . 
Now it is a priority , the results as soon as possible , but this could take several months , perhaps even a year . 
, for its part , assured Gilberto López Meyer , Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for aircraft and services in Mexico), that the helicopters from the Estado Mayor Presidencial the surcharge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit flown and the plane fell to a soft Abhang . 
" This information strengthens the assumption that it was taken at the time of impact to a normal Flugoperation . " 
At a press conference , the head of the SCT , Pérez Jácome , six relevant points which , in the investigation should be taken into account: 
Flight: 
In line with the standards was a flight to the rules of the flight , which means that should have had the team during the flight and on the ground is sufficient . 
Weather conditions: 
The AICM , appropriate weather conditions at the start . Forth--that during the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexiko-Staat went on some deep some clouds . 
Elected routes: 
It is possible that selected the team because of the clouds a lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca-Tal . 
Impact of: 
The impact of the latest radar and recording of the helicopter agree . Perhaps there has been before the impact of a loss on the plane , a deviation from the air route . 
Were the remains of the aircraft in a limited area: 
The until now this information indicates that the helicopters from ascending and seitlicher direction aufgeprallt was . 
The pattern of the plane scattered remains suggest that was aufgeprallt the helicopter with its intact structure on the ground . 
No evidence of fire or explosion: 
The remains of the aircraft at the scene of an accident at either fire may suggest explosion . 
The last results point to several Bodenkontakte . 
In the investigations on the ground aircraft spare parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level . Abschüssig and is showing Schrägung of seven to  degrees . 
The photos show the sequence , in which the helicopters is likely to break . 
Some information suggests that could have had the helicopters several ground contacts . 
After a minuziösen search in an area that is beyond the wake at the scene of an accident railroad-bridge , could not be found commutes aircraft spare parts , which the adoption bio-fortified that caring for Flugzeugstruktur against the soil .
