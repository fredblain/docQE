21 s house in Vienna 
The umgezogene pavilion 
By Mrs Wiensowski 
An architecture history with ups and downs , End happy: the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels , 1958 , was in Vienna to the museum , and unladen 's . 
Now he is in the exhibition . 
If of modern architecture Greater , of clear forms , glass , the halls , courageous swings and new building materials are typical of the belief in the technical progress , it is the Austrian pavilion of the architects Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels Expo 1958 a good and famous example . 
Schwanzers pavilion at the time the Grand Prix d Architecture for his easy and completely Stahl-Glas-Konstruktion . 
The construction has , to date as a milestone contemporary architecture . 
He made the architects so well known that the Austrian also in the next World Expo pavilion , . 
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich , he was 1973 , internationally famous . 
His as a temporary construction planned exhibition pavilion had been drawn up after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden in Vienna southern railway station , converted and opened 1962 is a museum of the 20 st century - the ' 20 s , " it was called . 
Was defective and technically the buildings but neither space as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art , not a good climate . 
It was , however , used until such time as the contemporary art in Vienna a new house . 
Since 2001 , the building was empty and more and more . 
Now has transformed the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion , he is now " 21 's House " and will be used in future as a museum for contemporary art . 
Tuesday evening opened the museum celebration , which includes the House , where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect . 
Has managed the restart Agnes Husslein-Arco , which was 2007 new member of the Austrian gallery celebration . 
Husslein-arco , qualified art historian with considerable career , in the youth and Eiskunstläufererin , later at Sotheby 's , the Guggenheim museum and as a founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg , the conversion to politicians and Denkmalschützern , they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and set the use . 
The present art should be issued the works of the Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous Foundation , a café and a book shop there should be , and an office building had to be built . 
Strict supervision , small budget 
For the operation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation . 
Not only because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive and South-Mediterranean and had won the competition , but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was " incredibly important place ' , in which he " almost every weekend " had read the exhibitions . 
He knew the Ur-Entwurf , and he knew the problems of the building , which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and ease . 
In the current restructuring there was far greater problems: the buildings was " a Energieschleuder , " Krischanitz says . 
The page-window profiles of the glass facade were replaced , glass fibre reinforced Isolierglas and replaced the glass roof by special security glass . 
Kältebrücken-stahlträger have been strengthened or replaced , and asbestos full blankets were rescued . 
Two missiles were under way for the new use , a abgesenkter light gap between House and road; provides for the Belichtung , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building , but still the easy Schwanzer-Pavillon . 
The original external doors have remained , the House is deleted in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz-Farbton . 
And the theatre is exactly the way is even more , as he was in the past . 
And all this under strict supervision of the monument and with a small budget . 
" Often had to be found a material that is good and proper , and was also the Denkmalschutzamt ' , says Krischanitz and points to a raw language in the soil Untergeschoss . 
Despite all the pressures , problems and improvements to the building has remained flexible and easily . 
It was difficult with the pavilion , " came the from Brussels , " said Krischanitz recently , a typical " Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte . " 
I am a architecture " always in the wrong place ' and to ' give a real awareness . " 
In this case is the 21 House; but not in the wrong place , because it is an urban stroke of luck: the Swiss garden there is just the completely new planned " Hauptbahnhofsquartier , with office and residential buildings . " 
And another stroke of luck will be perhaps: The 21 s house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz-Bau , because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought out the Berlin art , and we hear that they negotiated with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden .
