Libyan victory 
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows their losers . 
Muammar el-Qaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him is over the war . 
Now , there are just to define the winners . 
As usual him of that region , Islamists win in the elections , the only question is , what - the moderate or the radical . 
The National Transitional Council , the common law of the Scharīʿa , of which we are now in God has some idea . 
Libya would the country without crime , because for theft peck in short hand . 
Women should forget idea of emancipation as soon as possible , any congregants; breakaway are executed , and so on . 
Instead of a single dictator will society from mutually feuding tribes from the Koran . 
In short , in Libya will be an order apply; here would be hard to imagine and above all , not desirable . 
Only now is not the only - our lifestyle and objectively , will probably not be the best fit and would change the already-mentioned Libyans hardly . 
Accordingly , it is astonishing that the Moslem-Kämpfer rather of the infidel dogs clueless.Despite help at all . 
Was promoted to serve their defence , may only be the fact that the air strikes ΝΑΤΟ not by any General from America , but of Allah even led , whose omnipotence after every successful examples . 
The winners in Libya ? The West is not one of them . 
We were only in a shooting incident , served the interests of Islam and our politicians sought in the person of the dictator of political allies , without any advantage . 
Of the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq , we prefer a military occupation of Libya . 
This is the Hiesigen a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders . 
The oil companies but also without occupation , the black gold on the song ? 
Hardly and can boast the West once with his selflessness in the protection of human rights . 
If they did not spoil the Scharīʿa-Vertreter .
