MSS is a research protocol to the finding of the gene for obesity . 
They Social Security Institution Mexico 's , a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people , which is supported by IPN . 
The Mexicano Instituto del Seguro Social - IMSS social security fund (Mexico) announced that a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title " genetics of obesity in childhood and youth " is to be found the genetic markers associated with obesity . 
Miguel Cruz López , the head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department for medical research , focus biochemistry) to the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI said that one team , consisting of doctors , improve , Ernährungsspezialisten and social workers . 
This team is supported by specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) Politécnico del Instituto Nacional (IPN). 
The population is invited to take part in the study , interested parties can come to sports of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico , where every Saturday from 8.00 a.m. tests with children and young people . 
He stressed that the investigation at the sports Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) started and since 8 October at the sports Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue . 
If that is the target of 500 to 600 inquiry; people , the study on the football field of Independencia (in the south of the main city of) and on the Morelos (in the north of the main city of). 
He said that the aim of the study had knowledge of other factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases . 
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes , it will come to an end , he said that  children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years with the consent; and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires . 
You will also raised questions about their physical activity and their family disease in history to risk factors that could have diabetes or renal insufficiency , to control . 
He took it from that (measured by the aforementioned Saturdays the Untersuchungspersonen weight , size , Taillenumfang), their blood pressure controlled and Blutwerte as the Glukosespiegel , Triglyceride , Cholesterol , insulin and genetic factors (attempt the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity) would be destined . 
Cruz said López , this would take place at the concerns of health staff on the alarming increase in weight of young people . 
" By the health surveys from 1999 and 2006 that have increased in less than six years , the proportion of obese young at 77 per cent and the girls with obesity at 47 percent , and the obesity has increased dramatically , " said the specialist of the IMSS . 
He stated that the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of the population in Mexico with that of other peoples unterschiede . 
He was that on average , a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65 per cent to 30 per cent of European and indianisch-amerikanischer , to 5 per cent of African origin , which is in the genes , which are associated with diabetes and obesity , ' . 
In general , he said the genetics of obesity emotion-related in the inability of the surplus to us energy (calories) to burn out , so that will be stored in this form of fat . 
The researchers , the direct benefit of the study participants were in a comprehensive study of children , which would , if this were a degree of obesity or obesity . 
It would even the presence Hautfalten dark in the neck and Innenarm (Akanthosis), the point to the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the preliminary stage , investigated . 
All the information would be treated as confidential and informed the parents in writing by the doctors and the doctors say the parents all measurements and propose them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases . 
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors , which are responsible for being overweight , obesity and other chronic diseases , lack of exercise , which means lack of movement in everyday life , most of the time of the day in front of the television to and to use means of transport , rather than short ways to to go . 
The high caloric intake , meaning that an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and analysis (Tamales , bread , pizza , hamburgers , etc .), together with a high fat and protein and genetics , which is to be analysed in this research project .
