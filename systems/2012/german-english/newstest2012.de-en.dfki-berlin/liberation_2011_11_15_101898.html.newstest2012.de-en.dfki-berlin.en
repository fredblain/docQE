Energy policy: 
Facts should win against dogmas 
There is a matter that is not on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions , so this is certainly the energy policy . 
Availability and cost of electricity matter--to in direct Mae purchasing power and the competitiveness of the company . 
It is reasonable to take a Wahltreffen for a reason , to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy . 
The debate will only bear fruit if it the whole economic , social and environmental consequences of the proposed explored options . 
The French should their opinion on objective facts , quantum leap rational data . 
Although there are 7 billion people on the planet , the demographic evolution a doubling of the electricity demand by making 2050 , must not give up a huge share of the world 's population in a vital element . 
At the same time , it must be the scarcity of fossil resources , in order to be able to continue to produce residuarity electricity , without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , a lost from the environmental debate issue , to forget , to combat climate Unregelmäβigkeiten . 
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters . 
Therefore blebt Germany continue to isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power . 
This is not the case in Belgium , which is the decision of the need to find a replacement objectives--before replacement source , in Switzerland , which is just to build more nuclear power plants in the last generation . 
Groβbritannien , Finland , Poland , the Czech Republic , the Netherlands , Sweden , South Africa , China , India and Brazil , to name just a few states , pursue their projects continue to unenthusiastic; with determination . 
The United States have decided , after Fukushima , its Park another , using the following the nuclear accident Sidmar Three Mile Island once again go into operation . 
Even if the focused on renewable energy sources , German model occasionally as an example , that is , however , the reality the discourse . 
The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of the means , one by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence in particular of Russia , an increase in the gas and coal plants CO2 emissions . 
The whole of this unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months to come . 
Denmark is a cause for thought the case . 
Denmark is European tables leader in wind energy , from which it takes 30% of its electricity , but the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas , used it with wind energy; because of his CO2-Ausstösse and its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average . 
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours a contrary to our French budgets by 40% higher electricity bills . 
As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key role of the competitiveness and the stability of the industry at national soil , the French electricity companies because of the best in Europe . 
Any significant reduction on the nuclear power would therefore a strong increase in the price of energy , what the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power to liesse illusion . 
Polls showed that the price is , the very broad majority of French people , as well as little is willing to pay , they resistance against the principle of this energy source . 
Let us remind ourselves that our country 's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 inferred jobs . 
Because of their strong Exportcharakters brings them a whole lot of specialised small and medium-sized businesses on the international markets and makes these authors of countless jobs . 
France should take the decision to exit of nuclear power , it would put a Groβteil SMEs to victims , and the annual 6 billion euros in capital goods and Kernenergieexport would be more and more greatly reduced . 
The electricians would make a work on sixty years designed EPR , when is the decline of its producers ? 
In order to solve the energy equation we must recognise that there are no more a as a devil a miracle cure for producing electricity . 
The developed by the company Areva , low-carbon solutions on the use of nuclear power and renewable energy of the complementarity of energy sources . 
This is the highest possible level of security for the nuclear power an absolute imperative . 
In France we have a safety authority , is the clear and transparent controls in existing plants such as the construction in Flamanville . 
Their work teams , who have made a name for their professionalism , are the safety position just had . 
The nuclear industry has seen three serious incidents within 50 years . 
Only one , and at Three Mile Island , under normal operating conditions has occurred , and so has he been without consequences for people and the environment . 
At Chernobyl was the tragedy of reactor design and unendschuldbares , human error . 
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters unprecedented scale , which caused the deaths of several thousand people . 
The nuclear industry will learn their lessons , from this accident , as they had done so after the two previous . 
As a result of this approach and the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants , the EPR a draft , giving him resistance to such phenomena . 
Because it is considered among the Elektrotechnikern as desirable to build a nuclear power station , it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF , liesse by giving them free rein to gut the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development . 
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best Energiebouquet for our country , but it would be irresponsible , emotion-generating , dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate to dominate , the equally determined economic , social and financial situation of our country .
