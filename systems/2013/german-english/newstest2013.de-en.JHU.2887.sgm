<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to confront the re-election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">The latter, the brennan Center for a myth, as it confirms that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lawyers of the Republicans have recorded in 10 years in the United States, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is for sure: these new provisions will adversely affect the turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, some of these measures are undermining the democratic system of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to Canada are the States responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual States.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedures for the registration or complicate the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has gained importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states could be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, 180 bills introduced in 2011 alone, the limit the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require that voters have photo ID and proof of us-staatsbürgerschaft present.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, these laws also shortened the period for the early vote, denied the right to register as voters on election day, declared invalid and citizens of the right to vote, for which a gerichtsakte vorliegt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections of 2006 has no us-staat required by the voters, produce a photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first state, has made such a request.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law in 2008 of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the last two years they promoted in 34 States draft laws, with which the voters be forced to produce a photo ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal ausweiskarte as the health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of the citizens, i.e. 21 million wahlberechtigte people no identification issued by a government of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay, in order to receive the necessary ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes disproportionately affected.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required identification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This goes further.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, who are regarded as voters who cast their vote vermehrt for democratic candidates in several countries, it is not allowed to use their identification issued by its creation.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, these same states will allow members of fishing or jagdvereinen, choose the more for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2004, a federal state for the select asked for proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state, introduced such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws, the voters demand that your us-staatsbürgerschaft nachweisen.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly aimed to limit the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, prefer the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, Republican legislators 2011 in eight states have laws promoted, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="33">They have also restricted the right of individuals and groups, we provide assistance to those voters who want to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, the campaigns to voter registration in the 2004 general elections contributed to approximately 10 million citizens to register.</seg>
<seg id="36">Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of registration of neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Moreover, the Republican legislators in five other States passed laws that aim to shorten the period for the early vote.</seg>
<seg id="38">For instance, in the 2008 general election in Florida 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same is true for the Hispanic population.</seg>
<seg id="40">The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast, the white, 76% of voters were, only 46% of the electorate, the chose in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, opposed the democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several bills have been blocked by the veto of the democratic governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">They could limit the damage in part.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of the 34 States passed laws that reveal demand of a photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws adopted in and see them as a clear aims to influence the 2012 results in the crucial states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A 2011 report from the brennan center shows that those states that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes represent the wahlmännergremium are needed to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is for sure: these new provisions will adversely affect the turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, some of these measures are undermining the democratic system of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1">prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: should be made the test or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The psa-test way in fact sometimes incorrect results, with false negative, but also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">This leads to more hesitation the already unentschlossenen men for the implementation of früherkennungstests.</seg>
<seg id="4">The test should be made or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have the opinion of two medical specialists obtained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study has also shown that, when a nachbeobachtung after 12 years, the likelihood the formation of Metastases is 30 to 40% higher, if no screening was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">For men afro-amerikanischer origin is also a higher risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The most important thing is to make the right decision, as a cancer was detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are cancers that are aggressive and others, the indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient must be shown the extent of the risk of its cancer really made clear by him the possible options, where prostatakrebse untreated, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases rather opting for an active monitoring of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">For many men, in which you have cancer detected, no treatment place today because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">It proposes an active monitoring and offers you a treatment in progression of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who does not.</seg>
<seg id="17">That is why I recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, it is most important to speak with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the international society for urology movember has developed an instrument, with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of psa-tests.</seg>

<seg id="21">Prevention the disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">"if there were no more smokers, this would value at least 50% increase," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian krebsgesellschaft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several remain completely unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian krebsgesellschaft the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It seriously damages the health of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In accordance with the Canadian krebsgesellschaft fördern overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They seem to increase the risk for breast, grimmdarm- mastdarm- speiseröhren- bauchspeicheldrüsen- and cervical cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that a regular physical activity during the entire life against grimmdarmkrebs protects," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too much of it increases the risk of developing a grimm- bzw. mastdarmkrebs.</seg>
<seg id="41">meats should also be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The conservation of meat by räuchern, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogenic.</seg>
<seg id="43">"the latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, several scientists examined the link between vitaminzusätzen and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But their investigations are currently not conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">After the Canadian krebsgesellschaft are the studies on Vitamin E contradictory.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The higgs-boson analysed</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the likely discovery of the higgs-bosons has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">We believe in fact that this boson in nothing less than the mechanism is involved, who is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And it is, after all, the last particle whose existence from the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter - predicted, but empirically has not been observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the standard model predicted higgs-boson strongly resembles.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, that seems to be confirmed by new data that were presented this week on a large physik-kongress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to agree to be completely safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Nevertheless, we expect that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently there is a low risk to deceive, and we take a look at what it is about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world there is a necessarily unumgängliches law meant that two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not possible to break this rule - and try not to strong, because they will hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they also such a law, the Pauli'sche ausschlussprinzip that says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, when they are in the same "quantenzustand" and the "state" largely consists of some of its properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">On that basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner are the good citizens, which are called fermione and artig obey the pauli-prinzip.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in another move the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, which nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they are in fact in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The particle adventure these bosons are grouped according to the website of the BERKELEY laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the mesonen, which we will not deal with here and the "kraftteilchen spread," by the great forces of nature and with which the higgs-boson somehow would be used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It has to be stressed, however, that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are, as expected.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you are able to read these chronik, then only thanks to a bosons uitzonderlijke banality: the photon, or the "lichtteilchen," which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge up or change the direction," disrupted "the electromagnetic field that is in this place, like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">This "disorder" is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolettstrahlung etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "carrier of the force."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">stabileres field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same applies to the higgs-boson, with the difference that a different field, the higgs-feld, must be "disturbed" so that this boson shows.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the higgs-feld much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, its surface only by a very large rock zerfurcht could be.</seg>
<seg id="23">A giant particle accelerator as CERN is therefore necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are, in fact, not all particles and not all of the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never think of themselves on the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And not all particles interact with the same higgs-feld: those who do, have a mass, while the other (as, incidentally, the photon) have no mass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For what all this research now "may well be" asks Mrs plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For the science they serve the review of the standardmodells (sm), and also enable physicists to look closely at all the variations between the observations and predictions of sm.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are also many physicists, the eagerly hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and the model plug some holes.</seg>
<seg id="31">It has to be said that the latter is great shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the schwerkraft (ups!) and the dark matter, ups, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (again!).</seg>
<seg id="32">However, the CERN derartige abweichungen not found until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.</seg>
<seg id="35">By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the bell-laboren not suspected that their work would cause such a revolution.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the bell labs in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) - said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a "laborspielerei".</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">applications also can also arise from all the instruments, surrounded the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, in turn, has Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the look a small light sensor developed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras around the world today as "eye" and introduced him 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you really never know it can...</seg>

<seg id="2">With your committee for "Death with Dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of lebensendes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, is still a lot to do in this important area.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le devoir has tried to look more closely at this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago lebte Mr L. still alone in his apartment in The montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate cancer, aufzehrte him, had left him a period of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years managed," he said half-hearted, in his bed in the home for palliativpflege victor-gadbois in beloeil liegend, in which he arrived on the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"however, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared," he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from running alone to go to the bathroom and even to eat.</seg>

<seg id="13">The courage of the ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My biggest wish is that my diarrhea heals, since this is humiliating," he shares with.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"in the course of our lives, we learn that a man standing pinkelt," says Pierre brodeur, psychologe victor-gadbois at the home.</seg>
<seg id="17">Return to the kindheitsphase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It depends on the ability of the person to take a step backwards," he notes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because according to several people who work in the palliativpflege, find big events in the midst of this backward steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients in the home for palliativpflege victor-gadbois eingewiesen, are all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage you will by the doctors and nurses who care about you, no longer showered with so-called "healing" care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear," deliberately and by erstickung "to die.</seg>
<seg id="24">But by the disease I really got to know my children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children," she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have no wish more in life," she says, before you accept that you set up a mask that helps her breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">They expected in the next few days still a last visit their son, who is from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the home victor-gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers care and assistance in the food.</seg>
<seg id="29">The palliativpflege will be used, if there are no other options more.</seg>
<seg id="30">To the deaths more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec, on 11.700 inhabitants a bed for the palliativpflege.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is very little, if you take into account that one day we all will die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here is the live under the best possible conditions continue, explains Dr. christiane neustrie, one of the doctors of the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">It grants the dying according to a mundpflege with brandy or Pepsi.</seg>
<seg id="36">The diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar level.</seg>
<seg id="37">And the death is part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening we have Mr X a beer served, who died in the course of the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, his son the beer at the foot of the deceased austrinken.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help relatives and patients alike," berichtet pflegedirektorin Nathalie savard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the home victor-gadbois is not a day as the others.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition, an old man of 93 of the last familienzusammenkunft in court, and well supported by his pillow, while his honor anstößt, a young man dies of 36 years, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"for six months, three to five beds are always with cancer patients aged less than 45 years belegt shares," Dr. christiane neustrie concerned with.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the home victor-gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">problem of access to palliativpflege</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians have no special access to palliative care, i.e. to care, to alleviate the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in a hospital or a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organisations, such as the home victor-gadbois and the society for domestic palliativpflege in the greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">This is the big flaw in the healthcare quebecs ensures that several palliativpflege specialized doctors look forward to the adoption of a law on the regulation of euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.</seg>
<seg id="49">for the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliativpflege as Dr. Balfour mount and Dr. Bernard lapointe, in order to express their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">Dr. christiane neustrie, according to the health system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all right to quality palliativpflege have accepted, before we move on to euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with severe pain in the emergency room was, without having taken measures to their relief.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that the patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And, at the same time several oncologists treat their patients despite schlimmster forecasts verbissen until the last day.</seg>
<seg id="54">The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, as it has aborted a difficult chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I told my onkologin, that I will stop the treatment, she replied that they regret that I abandons the fight, told you.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, she had told me that I was at the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No omnipotente care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. neustrie believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, thank the staff that it has not granted this request, after their pain from a team of palliativpflege have been arrested.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it must be made clear that the palliativpflege in the schmerzbehandlung not omnipotent.</seg>
<seg id="60">After elsie monereau, head of the society of the domestic palliativpflege palliativpflege 8% of patients not to speak in the greater Montreal area a schmerzbehandlung.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life are the doctors, often back to the terminals sedation, the gist of which the patients either sporadic or permanently until the date of his death einzuschläfern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques duchesneau seinerseits notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but is especially concerned about the role of "officials who are aware of the tactics," if they were not involved in the fraud.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the basis of a 70% share of jewelry in the financing of campaigns in Quebec witzelt he: "I was told that this was only a weak simulacrum of reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The Quebec Government proposes to limit the donations to parties at $100, which will not be strictly limited, according to him, nothing would change in the situation: "as long as the wahlkampfausgaben schwarzgeld in politics in circulation."</seg>
<seg id="37">He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the awarding of public contracts and the funding of parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by the things with courage on the bottom, we can rebuild the House on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story Quebec's international reputation and that of Montreal damages, calls on Mr duchesneau those who laugh, to take a look in their own backyard.</seg>

<seg id="1">"psg is not the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season, you have with psg a new scale.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of psg erklären.</seg>
<seg id="5">Great players have come.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day I do on your side progress.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff has given me too much.</seg>
<seg id="8">These elements spur me on a daily basis to improve my spielniveau.</seg>
<seg id="9">And in a game this is even easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football, everything is very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I breche not in enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF clairefontaine until my season in saint-etienne I have always made gradual progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">They take advantage of thus introduced by Carlo ancelotti competition...</seg>
<seg id="14">The latest additions this summer are accustomed to win games is very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training session is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">This means that a player like me, must offer the forehead and wants to give his best.</seg>
<seg id="17">It gives me Carlo ancelotti much in relation to my spielposition.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is supported by co-trainern as Claude makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">ancelotti is the right person for the job?</seg>
<seg id="20">,.</seg>
<seg id="21">ancelotti flößt all technicians respect.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious vereinen.</seg>
<seg id="24">He had contact with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that he will win more titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, I had just recovered from a verletzungsserie.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that he has put in me, is also an explanation for my services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think of the first part of the season of psg?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of the spitzenreiters Lyon us.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we lurk in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the first knockout round in this way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the goal of the association in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to get as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, anything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, we are against very good European teams have our say.</seg>
<seg id="37">First of all we want to first of our group in Porto, so that we can complete the second leg of the achtelfinales as home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can the psg in the short term, a major European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">He already has the budget for...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to be a major European club, Paris title win and make a name for himself in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is not the case today.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially is the psg the resources, so that this project takes concrete forms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">It would be a big failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, it would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year it is really close to our hearts, this title abzusahnen.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season we were close.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to the victory davonzutragen.</seg>
<seg id="48">We have finished the season with a very strong performance.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have concluded with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally should be master with 79 points...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">I believe that this year is the right thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux to win the title rings, I believe that we have the stuff to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media too much of the psg expect?</seg>
<seg id="55">In view of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accept the perfect.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, if we in a home game against troyes 4-0 win, and it still is, something you can accuse us, this is certainly something frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what the people expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We could never every weekend with 4-0 win.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="61">We try to set up a concept.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team builds up over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">shown in the Champions League we have strength.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons is unable to qualify for the first knockout round, and has also made huge spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In terms of the sums invested believed you to spielpause with 15 points ahead!</seg>
<seg id="66">This means that our opponents and ignored the French championship would.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, the last season were not good, from this new psg "geboostet."</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we will be in the month of May the smiling winner and tell us that we have won, despite all the difficulties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The psg seems completely from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic abhängig to be.</seg>
<seg id="71">So much the better, that speaks of a "zlatan-abhängigkeit."</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovic is really powerful and scores many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">That is why he came and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever he has played, he has reminded that he is a great player and a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the team we respect both the player and the person.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people who surrounded him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done, is really extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="78">This encourages others to improve their spielniveau.</seg>
<seg id="79">thiago Silva, is one of the world's best defenders, allows all other also to make progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you have seen the 2012 with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">It was very important to me to participate in this em.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury prevented from something playing herauszuschlagen.</seg>
<seg id="84">I have seen things there, emerged strengthened from which I am.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today it was me to achieve good games in the national team.</seg>
<seg id="86">This was for my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.</seg>
<seg id="87">From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must demonstrate exemplary behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What are your views on the first few months of Didier deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He has promising results.</seg>
<seg id="90">We have a good position in the qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">The nationaltrainer is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">As it was Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would like to make no comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had achieved its aim, by he had qualified for the European championships.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier deschamps the "Bleus" will lead to Brazil.</seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id="2">The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, as so often in these technologies is a political vision greifbar: the belief that the current, of bankmonopolen designed monetary system, leading to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, this is of satoshi nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) convertible and a protocol for the secure exchange like bittorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With 15,000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions recorded.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several thousand webseiten accept bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the course of bitcoin had reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later, before he has recovered today to around $10 to $2 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing particularly impressive in relation to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies shown interest for this.</seg>
<seg id="10">It describes bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."</seg>
<seg id="11">bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a video game that you win or play with (and sometimes zurücktauschen) can buy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the trade is controlled by a central authority and each time bearbeitet.</seg>
<seg id="14">With bitcoin are all netzknoten gleichzeitig repositories of the rechnungsbuchs, auditors, geld-emittenten and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two email addresses in the form of an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the difference that the user can choose a different address for every payment, ensuring the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A number of the associated with this transaction data will electronically through a double verschlüsselungssystem signed.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded in the entire network widespread rechnungsbuch of public accounts are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is done through a mathematical task which started on the computers, with the winner, which is a kind of preliminary zentralbankier, has the privilege to add this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a carving up the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computer "take" the new transaction and add it a number, before the whole "zerhackt."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find that number, which is a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning) ergibt.</seg>
<seg id="26">If this number was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is thus permanently with the chain of all other transactions verknüpft, and any modification would change the fingerprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user wants to cheat Two times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other is no link, because both have different fingerprints.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer, which has resolved the task, gets 50 bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To prevent inflation this reward will regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but to a hundertmillionstel teilbar, what makes some room for manoeuvre.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement of computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network has already had ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">The websites that provide services for bitcoin, have been attacked and the bitcoin-einlagen stolen.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The vulnerability is not the actual minutes used," assured Pierre noizat just paymium has introduced, this is a company with real money for the payment and the network bitcoin uses.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, cash also these shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="38">major players such as Wikipedia verweigern donations of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="39">By others such as the blog-plattform wordpress will accept them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel rechnungsbuch analyses and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, a "mega-schlussverkauf" started.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon holmquist is pleased, who works for the company coinabul the bitcoins converted into gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre noizat, is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as transaktionsnetzwerk.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate the transactions that it is cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, manages the owner's identity and thus can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system can be easily implemented in the traders, and the latter must no new terminals or install computer programs.</seg>
<seg id="47">You just need an address, a phone "can be photographed and identified", is Pierre noizat plyuk, assured that he has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There, it is a general trend in the hierarchical systems for more horizontal ausgerichteter systems be reconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It will take some time before bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.</seg>

<seg id="1">A constitution with the brechstange in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a new poker game of President Mohammed mursi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt in terms of the verfassungserklärung it temporarily the unlimited authority granted remains divided, more than ever, he has decided to go for broke.</seg>
<seg id="4">To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day his final version.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week ago, the Head of State this House granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Egypt is now for nearly two years based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has only provided for an even stronger divisions in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For his opponents remains the President in his "autocratic delirium," adding he continued "breaks his word" and "the right underfoot."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the side of his supporters assured you that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">within 14 days should a referendum will be held.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, which is forcing the brothers to abandon their plan, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also a way for the President, his public and democratic legitimacy of action during the protest raging across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">After bekräftigungen in an interview with the American wochenschau time seems to be Mohammed mursi convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially as the Egyptian people vote with this recourse to a hasty vote will put an ultimatum: "Either you for my draft or I keep the unlimited power," the latter should supposedly put an end after the adoption of the Constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of Liberals is not fulfilled the request.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly before the verfassungserklärung mid November, they have turned away, as they are of the opinion that they have not been able to bring to bear, their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or the civil society have acted similarly.</seg>
<seg id="19">To reach the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, deputy Members, added.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are the moslembrüdern retentie.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprising that the article meistens adopted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">The commentators found it entertaining, incidentally, that the only difference of the day... in the time for prayer is expressed, as some members of the board were of the opinion that the grandfather clock, the constituent assembly was not exactly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, paragraph 2, drew all the attention, is identical to that of the constitution of 1971 and says that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The salafistischen parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace "the principles" by "the rules", which would have made a stronger application possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of its good intentions and for your respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"hypocrisy" say the Liberals, who see this only as propagandaschlag.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, according to them, is the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items.</seg>
<seg id="29">You have particularly Article 220 zuerkennt a consultative role in the eye, of the University of al-Azhar, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the ägyptenspezialistin Sophie pommier this is worrying, because "the people who have been asked for an opinion, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see that the first signs of a theocracy."</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the Liberals will also fed by the fact that the next rector of the university will be much less moderate than the current.</seg>
<seg id="33">"there is currently no specific religious commitment to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, are not ulema, but scholars who have been trained to become part of the French system," Alexis blouet appeased, the writing a thesis about the Egyptian verfassungstransition.</seg>
<seg id="36">He but acknowledges that "in relation to the Article 220 can have a ambiguity, because the terms used the religious vocabulary are based.</seg>
<seg id="37">It relates in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, shops. red.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future could be raised the question to what extent zivilrichter are competent to decide."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday strongly criticised because of the far-reaching powers, which he granted the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The moslembrüder argue that these are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another point of contention: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military is the examination of the defense budget not presented to Parliament, but a National Defence Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">As there will be no ban on civil cases in military courts, as the associations have called for the defence of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text with you as the freiheitsbedrohend ansehen.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, and could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">Furthermore, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines heba morayef by Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">Your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not included in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">Supporters of the Head of State will be Saturday aufmarschieren.</seg>

<seg id="7">So far this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, the local housing and retail.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, should the tests with time, according to federal migrationsbehörde in future for all workers to be compulsory.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this context, we must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and to the foundations of the legislation.</seg>

<seg id="15">The migrants can store the tests in all the cities; already have already been more than 160 entsprechende centers opened in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal migrationsbehörde.</seg>
<seg id="17">civil rights activist, stellten prior to the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: what is this all about?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes is the provision to sprachkenntnisse show, both for the Russians, as well as for guest workers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all, counter the migrationsbehörde spokesman, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.</seg>
<seg id="20">"many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the delegation of the federal migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor sebelew.</seg>

<seg id="22">Only organised rekrutierung will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We get many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the home, you will be the one promised, and on arrival you cheated to get their passports taken and not receive the promised reward," confirms the head of the headquarters for migration of the Tajik migrationsbehörde tolib schwaripow.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia want to earn their money, that they not only do not speak the language of the country, but also can hardly express in writing in their own language.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not your fault, so much as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks, can also make a sensible primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because there are not even money to feed the children in their families, let alone to buy them a decent clothes, shoes and schulsachen.</seg>

<seg id="32">"It is difficult without sprachkenntnisse," you are.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and inferior."</seg>

<seg id="34">Human rights activists say on the law following important aspect.</seg>
<seg id="35">The test must only migrants with legal status for.</seg>
<seg id="36">You have this status not, so there is no investigation and, therefore, no official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">banned "welcome" or "access for unauthorized"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain in Russia, an official status.</seg>
<seg id="40">Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Also the legalisierung costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">Make a fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The employees of the Russian police know that our documents largely gefaelscht and we are not registered, and it will create cases of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="44">"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," is the tadschike umed huschkadamow to journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Just spare no expense for false papers"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be forged.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some counterfeit certificates, the completion of the sprachtests bescheinigen, have already been by employees of the federal migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.</seg>
<seg id="48">The fake papers were printed with a normal color.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners this not in vain: every migrant who hoped to be able to save as the tests, paid for the document siebentausend rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">That is more than twice as much as the cost for the official review: this costs a arbeitsmigranten three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and civil rights activist agree.</seg>
<seg id="52">For the moment the authorities can immigrant workers covered by the test for the first time, only promise that you get time for a sprachgrundkurs.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition, newcomers without sprachkenntnisse posts in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="22">Further illegally sold weapons come from military waffenlagern.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">Another channel of the schwarzmarkts is smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is a dedicated, sometimes artisanal production and a mafia, which organised the smuggling," explained the former military.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The experts analyzed reports of the interior ministry and the Federal State statistics service, kriminologische literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the issue of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of the illegal weapons, according to the investigators, from the army and the rechtsschutzbehörden.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the "debt of leaders, in their work with weapons to do it," says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data, the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% back to thefts in the production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">A verkaufsberater a waffenladens, does not want to be named, assured that weapons that are found in illegal excavations, long nobody buys, as they are outdated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">According to him, it is more likely that traders get the supply in a waffenlager.</seg>
<seg id="39">On a Ensign is a weapon, for example, type TT, bought a gun.</seg>
<seg id="40">The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the dealer is the weapon in the city and sells them there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The police know, of course, all aware and, therefore, if it cannot comply with the plan for the detection of crime, periodically kontrollkäufe dealers offer by the illegal weapons," adds the verkaufsberater.</seg>

<seg id="49">There are traders in the markets, but we must go there and with a code agree as "of Ivan iwanowitsch, the effect is that the daughter had lost a tooth."</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">One in four American teenagers sitting at some point behind the checkout of MC Donald's</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the last few days there was massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants across the United States popular fast food chains such as MC Donald's, Burger King, Wendy's, taco bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Yet no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether you will soon be back to the air out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase of modest wages of simple walmart- and fast-food-beschäftigten the organizers of the protests aim to form trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this sector of the economy is hardly gewerkschaftlich organisiert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents in the year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, in the ausverkäufe took place in the US, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes led to handgemengen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some walmart-mitarbeiter, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, your work down and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branch of the chain, which targets individuals are low and middle income.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sold all products, from diapers on hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The goods in the walmart-filialen is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why buy many of the slightly paid walmart-beschäftigten only at the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prices and the warensortiment machten Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Walmart the goods often sell only so cheap, because the staff are poorly paid.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain of serious conditions, for example lack of trucks or handscanner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases, and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution for the company health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical walmart-mitarbeiter, 9.5\ xC2$ deserves the hour, could not afford the increase, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company's wage increases on 12\ xC2 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are about 1.1% more than they now pay donations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Walmart wage increases would fully applies to the customers, kostete every purchase they only 46 cents more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">per year would be the extra expenditure of just 12,39 dollars for them compared to today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only to protests in nine States and that the company no losses bescherten.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, and the next day in this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">In total, the walmart-kassen on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The company's spokesman, Dan fogelman, said in an interview on the website of left-wing huffington post that a "less than five" walmart-mitarbeiter the work niederlegten only "another PR stunt" and the action of the trade unions, which organised the protests that had happened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"free cash!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests went further in New York this week, where their goal but not walmart-filialen (which are not wanted in this progressive city and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and others were cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says that the companies sell billion portions, and yet you, no krankentage, and you will be granted for your honest work not paid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">jumaane Williams, a member of the New York municipal</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation in 7,25 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fast-food-restaurants will gradually raised the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York 8,90 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's was behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">No one was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that they have to make do with this reward and sometimes even feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, there are the forum a comment to the newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protests, on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the 40th street and Madison avenue began, demanded that the cashier and chefs of fast-food-restaurants received a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They further demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food-branche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The US law prohibits it standing in the way of corporate governance, this objective and gewerkschaftsmitglieder abzumahnen or dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, makes the governance you not easy.</seg>
<seg id="43">The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food-branche is difficult but also for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">The main reason is the high staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">unhappy</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">noisy protests there was on this day, many other fast food options in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local democrats languages including stadtratsmitglied jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billion portions, and yet you, no krankentage, and you will be granted for your honest work not paid!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, bürgermeisterkandidat bill de blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food-mitarbeiter together so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, every New York deserves."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food-industrie.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, far from all of them employed in the fast-food-branche are in the tens of thousands of work in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The brain is so far only moderately überlisten"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The supporters of modern technologies popular issue of augmented reality is usually seen through the lens of a special glasses in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, Google in the summer, a working model at its annual conference in November was then know that Microsoft had such a patent pending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3d-technologies in microsoft-labor in Cambridge shahram izadi, is clear, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a durchgangsstation.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and virtual space to create.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- please describe a brief, what research your group operates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- we are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the limits of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">So far, humanity is largely stuck in the period in which worked with pixels on flat screens, sometimes will also be affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, we want 5-10 years vorausblicken and predict the radical changes this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the xbox-konsole and the kinect-sensoren a step forward, and today is no longer sold without kinect xbox, as all interested in motion control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- what awaits us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- although kinect the interaction has brought on a physical level, is much still on the flat, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The entry of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet decisive.</seg>
<seg id="14">We try to change, work in a real three-dimensional darstellungssystemen on the basis of various technologies, including projections.</seg>
<seg id="15">We have the computer world in our physical world entlassen and make it fassbarer.</seg>
<seg id="16">To this end, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its surroundings is recognized.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.</seg>
<seg id="18">First and foremost we should these bescheuerten virtual-reality-helme Los!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- what do you think about sprachsteuerung?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is popular, but it will not overvalued?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- It is certainly not the allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because they are not always all umstehenden would like to inform about his actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, any kind of interaction with computers good, however, each in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, we worked in the field of governance of objects in public places on a project, for which short and narrow, instead of spreading gesten experimentierten.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not recorded by the objektkamera, but by a bracelet, the movements of the bones and muscles registered.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is still relatively large, could in theory be reduced to the size of a watch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But overall, the future, mixed steuerungstypen, for example, gestures and language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- As?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For example - we would you ask me to give you this sprudeldose to rich?</seg>
<seg id="29">They say it and, at the same time it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Normally I say it simply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- oh, that would be very difficult to see.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- this means that they want the user can afford to adapt what a machine at the time and what is not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that in the next time we especially need to be working on the development of new sensortypen, which make it possible to capture reactions of people more.</seg>
<seg id="35">The can, for example be lasersensoren, as they offer in depth a good resolution, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- which claims they are on the basis of their work with the xbox kinect-sensoren on modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">There is a lack of resolution, deep or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- the current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, would be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithmen more work.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is not only the resolution along the X and y, but also along the z-axis are taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="43">, the speed and the number of frames per second are important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 fps, particularly for gestures too little.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen betishes entwickelte in our laboratory in redmond a berührungssensor with an adjustable verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).</seg>
<seg id="46">influenced not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For my work I needed just such a device, only without berührungssteuerung and with more frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- the number of cameras should not be increased?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- kinect is currently working with three "cameras," and one of them actually a infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is actually an ordinary rgb-kamera.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to calculate the objekttiefe.</seg>
<seg id="52">More cameras may solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">or increase the problem as more calculations would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be a flexible, kinect-ähnliches system, in which we could play with various kameraneigungen to see how we help the three-dimensional ermittlung a position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- if I remember rightly, Microsoft, in contrast to Google's glasses not to the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life the glasses has the best prospects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- of course it is not pleasant to keep unterwegs always collected a smartphone in the hand, but I think the following: the tollste variant would be a "changing" augmented reality, in which we have a cloud of the glasses could switch to the smartphone,</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private only you can see), but at the same time its weakness, because an augmented reality through glasses prevents you can work together with other virtual objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony stark in iron man, but also normalsterblichen accessible.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem, to the critics frequently this idea out: there is no tangible response.</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">The answers to your group on this point?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures, I often talk of the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think that the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of sensitive perception.</seg>
<seg id="65">An interesting method is currently the use of second hand as something unusual projektionsunterlage.</seg>
<seg id="66">It takes pressure notável true!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that actually are aimed at the "pictures in the air" to give a robust, for example, produces the interference by some gerichteten ultraschallstrahlen is in a certain point where the finger, a feeling, but at the moment is still so weak, as pustete someone on the handballen.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also tapes for the wrist to nervenendungen effect on the fingers, which is also a potential direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- have you tried to fool the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">It to think that it can feel what it should feel, if it sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- it is a good idea, so we have not yet tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here lies another task on which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a people that has to be physically located in a closed room, think that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">so far is only moderately outwit the brain, and we still have many busy years.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is precisely that which makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers so attractive: on many issues we are only at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="19">I realised that I must go down this route.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then there was the time the old free, but not officially recognised painter then to end, and new and free painters such as I was incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="21">I am friendly with the new generation of painters, so with the representatives of the "gazonewschina"; it was "pushkinskaya 10," and then was once end.</seg>
<seg id="22">It attracts me to theater, to fashion, music, actually to everything except the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">- and all the united in your art-klinik... - it was important to me to be at the heart of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995 I occupied a space in the pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovierungsarbeiten a musikalisch-künstlerischen club for the boheme, the House of St. Petersburg boheme.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many were born there: n.o.m. tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project "ucho van goga" There came.</seg>
<seg id="26">cast and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight shirts and also the trendy composer Igor wdowin today was one of them.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group started to play live, was from it "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">trachtenberg moderated many programmes before the time of "halli-galli."</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "griboedov" have their origin in the art-klinik.</seg>
<seg id="31">There, our employees and guests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, as culture still meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 2000 there was a poll in the press, on the award was "personalities of our city."</seg>
<seg id="34">I won in the category of "artist of the year," and that I was reached at the peak.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not easy to work in new times according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without making a cultural contribution to make.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- your work have a unique style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly currentness and sharpness of thought.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will have an exhibition with the theme of "the Russian museum as clowns."</seg>
<seg id="40">clowns timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">Earlier I was socially, but now it grieveth and bereitet fear, to be so.</seg>
<seg id="42">In a clown blurs the everything and loses his tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, we save the world by we dictate that everyone fully to dress up.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now, everyone on the clothes and is based on the outer and not on the interior of the people.</seg>
<seg id="46">But perhaps we cannot provide a person, but it should in the face of spit.</seg>
<seg id="47">The deception disappears through the verkleiden.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- recently we saw you in the role of urban drehorgelspielers. - a city of culture should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, if not I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- can also be commercial art be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">- today must be commercial art cautious, considerate and flattering.</seg>
<seg id="52">We see the collapse of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Earlier formed the people large groups: the bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people the other.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now there are mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not einhundert-dollar-note, everyone likes.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now you have to consider, whom you'll like.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now, every kultstar about 100 supporters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- to the appearances of stas michailow come but several thousand!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- come to him verlassene women, the sexuell-soziale sphere plays a role there.</seg>
<seg id="60">for cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes on.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have supporters, and the important thing is not to cheat and that, not to destroy it.</seg>
<seg id="62">In my youth I have such images painted in a collector even in a number with the works of Falk and larionow hingen.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with images, which normally only come at the end of the career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Today there are often misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="65">says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something quite different.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is the culture, which I support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- kirill, what is missing Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- good kulturexperten.</seg>
<seg id="71">say: servant of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not all of them can deal with culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the real Tsar it was different, because the Tsar understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow there are currently good advisers.</seg>
<seg id="75">In St. Petersburg, we have what the experts, but they could be the road is blocked, as it hochrangigerer experts need to properly evaluate the the former and you clear the way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now, only their own taste.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same applies to the erarta, but with the difference that you honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters, therefore, must look for other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">Petersburg - what is for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow, there is much more culture and an appropriate breeding ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">On our stones can art difficult to grow up.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural breeding because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are a lot of curious people, visit the exhibitions and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are the much less.</seg>
<seg id="84">Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">Many choices in my opinion, there is not.</seg>
<seg id="7">De facto, there are only two real planet, we could at least hypothetically inhabit.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomische sternberg-instituts Vladimir surdin.</seg>

<seg id="13">The fourth generation in orbit gezüchteten erbsen difference is not in the least of the species on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was followed by the breeding of insects, more of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how the weightlessness affects the development of embryos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is a normal chicks.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then the problem. begins</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is that the chicken stop must find; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laborleiter of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische problems ran, Vladimir sychew.</seg>

<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, will be based on the biosatelliten "bion" only same-sex species are.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">The greatest risk there was in Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">The most precious that mankind has, is the female body.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our möwe flew them, and no one on earth would you can answer the following question: übersteht the space?</seg>
<seg id="41">It is after this flight can bring a child into the world?</seg>
<seg id="42">"After all, no one answered this question," says raumfahrtveteran wachtang watschnadse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, only a year after their space, gave birth to the first female kosmonautin, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child, andrijan nikolajew, was also kosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988 gave birth to the second woman in all, swetlana sawizkaja twice was in orbit, and even work outside the raumfahrzeugs verrichtete, a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">, remains a risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only very few cosmonaut to long flights, where all went well and they got healthy offspring.</seg>
<seg id="48">"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in the orbit," concludes kosmonaut waleri poljakow, Hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="49">And yet the humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.</seg>

<seg id="53">Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is as if the small ichtyander zeugnis of drop that life on the land the ocean entstieg.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid as a child is, and that it can more easily get used to water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swim just 2 weeks go by.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is too little time to forget something," says babyschwimmlehrerin Marina aksenowa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">While for a newborn child so the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In a state of weightlessness is the bauch- and beckenmuskulatur extremely fast back and so has the ability, the child herauszupressen.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende hilfsmittel.</seg>
<seg id="61">The birth could also take place in a spezialkammer, for example, to the child herauszupressen.</seg>
<seg id="62">"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery poljakow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without the erdanziehung to feel, the organism the skeleton and muscles cannot train.</seg>
<seg id="65">A newborn child in orbit cannot be set as an adult for training in a belastungsanzug.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It is simply the lack of, which is vital for his life.</seg>
<seg id="67">"This experiment that we make, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, we will lead to a disabled, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world," says the head of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische bioethikkommission problems ran, Igor pestow, advance.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">nkú-chef: control of the schwarz-systems failed by verschulden Politics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic in connection with public contracts has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, is back in their application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the interview for aktuálně.cz says this is the Vice-President of the highest kontrollamtes (nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, nkú), Miloslav kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and I think that this is not the case with us," said kala the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">To a similar result is apparently a common control by Czech and German auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As negative praxisbeispiel he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "schwarz-system."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The Prime Minister, said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls would harass - so the system is now banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the regierungsvorsitzende come, and impede the kontrollamt, whose duty is now even the enforcement of the law, in its activities," kala notes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Chamber of Deputies they talked about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, under which both countries' laws on public contracts were compared.</seg>
<seg id="10">So what was it in concrete terms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">There is a parallel examination, with which we have started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, it is about the fact that the European legislative sets, as are, to build the national legislation on public contracts to handle. And finally, there is the real practical application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All of this we have compared, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences say. Generally speaking, are perhaps even something "strict laws in the US and perfect," but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. We must also deal with the actual implementation of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How can you help the project? What is for you from this project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">just such a common control could help that we stop, we constantly seeking perfection of the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this is apparently not particularly positive impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to purchase and to exclude illegal enrichment or criminal acts.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we are achieving this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It may even be that we the system in this way only with excessive paperwork burden"," and those who seek loopholes in the system, have it significantly easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold values remained higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech vergabegesetzes.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a similar authority as our nkú, or the system works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">With regard to the authorities, is the German equivalent of the nkú bundesrechnungshof, is similarly structured as both work with us and also has a College, this is just something else is formed, authorities is similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also the competences are comparable to a certain extent, and Germany is a state, however, is that there is this Courts of Auditors in the individual States - is the German system differs from our.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The brh may only federal funding control what our state funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities for us, subject to the control of landesrechnungshöfe there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">As regards the German legislation, is the easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general I would compare it without specific details reluctantly. Nevertheless, Germany is in some ways, often referred to as a model, and you certainly cannot say that Germany in particular is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Perhaps that is where the auditors are better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">This is certainly not, but as I said, such comparisons may not particularly like.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is still worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, also have problems to contend with.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise you would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, is it not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">As regards the Czech legislation, which was important for your authority the revision of the vergabegesetzes, feel they have any impact?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in force, it is in our tests have not yet.</seg>
<seg id="35">As our controls nachträglich, we must take place here with some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">implications we feel so far more in the preparation of future controls - as we have introduced the new instrument "recognition of risks inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed - this will impact the changes of course, as the thresholds to change the conditions for certain types of tenders were modified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">You see the adoption of this law more positive, or the system will be burdened with further bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">It can occur, however, the problem that the rules are "strict" and can no longer be met.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the previous Rules are a test unterzogenen people accountable to the carriers (for example, in the case of operational programmes of regional policy, the regional council) dahingehend that any failure to comply with the vergabegesetzes amounts to a breach of discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It makes sense, but then to make the law even tougher?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not believe in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system needs to exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not penalise those who have made a formal errors, on the real decision-making not impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Where is the way out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We say first of all, which way is not successful.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister recently said that allowing the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "schwarz-systems" behelligen würde - what does that mean exactly?</seg>
<seg id="48">The schwarz-system is now banned or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the regierungsvorsitzende come, and hinder the kontrollamt, whose duty is now even the enforcement of the law, in its activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He said: "We can change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we act as if nothing would be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The vergabegesetz contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is right for the protection of the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">But on the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone because of formfehlern is excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing with us.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">\ xC5 imon ornest: at our concerts we want positive energy sammeln</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about that in less than a month of doomsday is due to take place?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is one of those katastrophenmeldungen, to which we humans so like anspringen.</seg>
<seg id="4">We do with our band the tap tap more fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the doomsday to stop or prevent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December you realize also a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can our readers the project closer to vorstellen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a landesweite benefizveranstaltung, which we have two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this, we want to use the maya-kalenders marketingpotenzial whose end for the 21 December at 11:10 a.m. prognostiziert is.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, will take place from 21:00 gleichzeitig three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">The end of the concerts to be roughly at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a zeitzone for 12 hours ahead of the Mayan calendar ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">By whom is this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally think of me, then we have the idea together with our graphic honza Augusta fleshed out.</seg>
<seg id="13">We would not gain enough positive energy to the doomsday to prevent, but we also want to cooperate with the public, what state we consider this world once handed over to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of the maya-kalenders we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and schlüsselanhängern against the doomsday, with their purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The band the tap tap, together with other performers also included the so-called anthem against the weltuntergang entitled "doomsday is from."</seg>
<seg id="16">The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will also on the benefizkonzerten erklingen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, and in the end, provided that all is fine and the weltuntergang takes place...</seg>
<seg id="18">The anthem will be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, the hymns together in a direktschaltung by Czech television broadcast live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš hanák, who also plays the main role of Jesus in the video clip, also xindl X singt with...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you come to the cooperation with both?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We also cooperate with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, that implies that we achieve many fundraisers and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We strive to these people closely involved in our projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was clear that most are interested in cooperation with us, and enjoy it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What purpose benefits the proceeds of the concerts against the doomsday?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the establishment of the barrier bildungszentrums studeo, where we already six years together with the Association tap in jedlička-institut work.</seg>
<seg id="27">The students of the jedlička-instituts are regularly maintained by editors that help them in different activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">As the students themselves do not have the resources to the editors go, we want to help them in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the context of the completion of the jedlička-instituts should create its own building in which we then move in with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Each concert treten several groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">according to what criteria they have chosen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We wanted a program that appeals to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">In Prague treten chinaski, for example, support lesbiens illustratosphere with Dan bárta, the tap tap, marián bango and Jiří suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Similar "events" are also planned for the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we are for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are ever in the United States - this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Their auslandspläne are not just small, so far, they are already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The tap tap is, however, a group, made up of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How you manage these travel locistics and organisational?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as bad as it appears at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five of our Members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage. We must also, of course, many instrumentenkoffer and other luggage mitschleppen...</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, čsa and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I am sometimes have partly been surprised.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">By their foreign travel, you have a comparison, as it looks in the various countries with accessibility, as it deals with disabled people.</seg>
<seg id="46">As you have seen these things?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnesses to the fact that the East is everything still in its infancy.</seg>
<seg id="48">In Prague, Moscow is not disabled. It is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is not even there, of course, that there is a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator vorlässt.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, entstehen clubs there, are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in what way we must catch up with the more developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are still many things, in which we later on...</seg>
<seg id="53">It is, however, still be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal for people with severe disabilities selbstständig in public space, go to the museum, toilets can use.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not just üblich, that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in the public arena, where we are with the band The tap tap the West a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if major athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers from our ranks, are things really begin to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken personalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The tap tap is very popular at the moment. But if we go back a couple of years: what has it in 1998 motivated to start a band?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">At the time I started as a supervisor in jedlička-institut, where I met many young people who were interested in to deal with something hard.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I myself am musicians and ua. saxofon games, I, together with a colleague a musik-ag founded.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and with time is that as our leader, láďa angelovič is wont to say, something out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">became known the band but only in the last few years, or Am I mistaken?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that has helped us cooperation with famous singers; we have also started to campaign actively for us to.</seg>
<seg id="64">We are aware that, if something is doing and this is not to see on the outside, their own performance in a sense, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the eu-fördergelder we can also do good editors, high quality equipment and u.ä..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It was their goal, it with the tap tap so far to bring?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I have felt the potential that can things in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="68">copied in show business today often one of the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, in its own way as everything new viewed with caution and only after a long time will be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that tap tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of the viewers usually is, of course, pity; this is only natural.</seg>
<seg id="72">But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned nature, which we regret müssten.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who live a full life and can develop, if you have the funds to do so.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if people with disabilities in something, this is a progress not only for themselves, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">It was for this success also helpful, that you are a strict boss, as we hear from many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If you would like to do something well, we must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this is, in my view, completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you find that you need to have test twice a week, vorbereitungsphasen absolvieren and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then erlischt enthusiasm in many quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">It works everywhere, in every band who work seriously and wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, the tap tap 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998 in this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">A single: láďa angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group. The people come and go. You cannot prevent.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and the desire on the part, is welcome at any time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">will take place the day before the predicted Doomsday, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, Poland was on a ministerratssitzung of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as zwanzigstes Member of this space. Poland is included with the second Member State from the former eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 esa-mitglied).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland started in 1994 a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years in several esa-projekten.</seg>
<seg id="4">The way of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before the Second World War, Polish kosmosbegeisterte employees with the space, but they do not always on understanding stießen.</seg>
<seg id="6">I refer, for example, of the lecture by A.\ xC5 ternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work presented "entrance to the outer space exploration."</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (born. However, 1905) made the audience cold, and after years remembered\ xC5 ternfeld yet that only Dr. Jan gadomski had shown interest in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">\ xC5 ternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the outer space exploration" by Robert esnault-pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten Prix rep-hirsch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of the space was ua. dadurch acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 a eisenbahn-draisine was built in Poland, for which a raketenantrieb was planned.</seg>
<seg id="13">The author of the proposal and the details of this project were unfortunately unknown.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or to brake the draisine should be used.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information come exclusively from the contemporary press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish infantry, to deal with raketenbetriebenen floors.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research led the Institute komórka techniki uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw wolfke and Prof. gustaw mokrzyckiegi.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is clear from the documents which that the research to the stage of practical tests vorgedrungen war.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">in 1937, in the press of dipl.eng. rohoziński stammende draft fotoelektrischen jagdrakete on, and the following year was the work of "rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza leliwa-krzywoblocky" of the author.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects dealt with the military use of the raketenantriebs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of raketentechnik from temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy) coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work was completed its work, however, the war began.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">More articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish raumfahrtgesellschaft (polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne) in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">The first mention of this society is in 1954 in the November edition of the Journal problemy, in which four long articles are devoted to the space.</seg>
<seg id="26">The article by Prof. M. subotowicz contains the proposal to create a raumfahrtgesellschaft.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time there was already the first projects for comparison, and it was clear that the Exploration of Space future would have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Already in its beginnings in 1956 was the Polish raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accede to the International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA was founded in 1951 in the autumn of 1956 ordinary Member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year, the first pta-vorsitzende, Kazimierz zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space.</seg>
<seg id="30">held he had this position until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">since 1956, the PTA maßgeblich took part in the development of highly successful meteorological rakete (rakieta meteorologiczna), the first Polish rakete for scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type, the rm-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1,800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, an improved version, the rm-1a, built, and began in 1959 in the błędów-wüste flugtests with the zweistufenrakete rm-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">A further development should already be able to make real scientific work - the rakete rm-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of höhenwinden used.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 1962, however, was the further development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">rm, the successor to the first missiles of the type from 1962 to 1965 entwickelte meteor-1-rakete.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was designed as zweistufenrakete, their total fraud 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">From this rakete three types have been developed (meteor-1a, -1b and -1c), which differed from each other in the size of transportraums for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The meteor-1a-rakete had a transportraum with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1b about 0,34 liters and meteor-1c 0,62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum altitude fraud in all three types 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the 1965 to 1968 was developed in luftfahrtinstitut meteor-2-rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 miles.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then, the versions meteor-2h and meteor-3 built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Also worth noting is the accession of Poland to cospar (Committee for space research) in 1960, on the creation of a national cospar-ausschusses followed two years later.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland was also involved in the framework of the interkosmos-programms with Soviet satellites in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot miroslaw hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimír Remek zweiter interkosmonaut.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week, the Constitutional Court the law on voluntary work.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision gave rise to a lively debate in the public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is certainly interesting to look at the issue time from a wider perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the end, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">due to the large differences in the value of work (löhne) It comes to preisspannungen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this term is through a state trying to understand where the manufacturers, imports of cheaper goods in the economic competition, making the competition for usurping "unterbietet," with a greater market share and increase its profit.</seg>
<seg id="10">This means on a large scale for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business there. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, necessarily the spending increase.</seg>
<seg id="12">This situation is made even worse by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby to replace the total economic and social damage caused by them.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reckless practices of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce artificially the social level of their own people and thus to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is particularly in changes to existing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The objective of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital in particular lohnbereich.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other by reducing workers' rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are several years ago public lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people, are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of affected is already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it regularly to cases in which workers such a small salary that the state must increase their income to subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employees workers exposed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures of practically all eu-südstaaten undoubtedly will amount to the same condition, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance darben on the margins of society and do hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here is, of course, the question of where this capital is?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty moves from one country to another; or the capital remains altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">liberal theories and media claim that the state must not with capital involved in its own economy ad nauseam, and that planned economy lead to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital engstirnig insists on his position that the state does not lenkend should intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">But then we must ask if the capital the policy and to the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even beyond.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here is the clear answer: yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof of this is the existence of a practically ubiquitous almighty and in all States lobby.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual bevorteilung, of legislation, is criminally punishable, but nothing in the virtually everything.</seg>
<seg id="34">The situation in Germany is such that a staatsministerium due to a lack of finances private, closely with the industry verflochtene rechtsunternehmen tasked with formulating gesetzentwürfen.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills will then be adopted in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">The violence is no longer, as the Western verfassungen announce, but of strong financial groups, from the people who prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly fall into a situation, as you appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman republic at times cäsars and pompeius' describes: "the state has long been understood in the collapse, and the offices were filled by violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">against schmiergeld, through illegal erschleichung of benefits or with stone and sword.</seg>
<seg id="39">corruption has grown hemmungslos vote already purchased, and the people went to the election... "" People with character bewarben not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul... "" I really started talking about it, that the only medicine is a one-man rule in this difficult situation, and that should be a strong man elected... "appian thought it to him, but the strong man was finally Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the one-man rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As it turns out, is today's society as well as in ancient times based on the reckless preference of their own advantage, without paying attention to societal interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private sector is by its very nature, not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognize and enforce.</seg>
<seg id="42">Now, as then, the result is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, not in the slightest seek deeper reforms.</seg>
<seg id="43">The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore look to the ruthless liberalisation of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Seen from the current state, the sinking this regime for liberal democracies can be regarded as some pause, already looming in the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are already today, and witnessed the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="46">The lifting of the law on voluntary work here is not a solution, at least not permanent.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure from the global and European economic competition the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to press down the social level of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore systembedingt.</seg>

<seg id="4">After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The a stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians describe as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide and committed to the Palestinian Arabs call the State of Israel as a terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this point, I would not write about it, who in these recurring waves of killing schuldiger and who is victims; in the end, Israel's current residents including selbstverwaltungsgebiete were born in the current political situation and have not seen the beginning of the violence itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">My concern is to open up the readers look behind the scenes, the look, whom the 95 years spannung (gerechnet wersji balfour-deklaration in November 1917) in the small parcels of land in the Middle East are mainly serve.</seg>
<seg id="8">My thoughts are based partly on zugängliche historical facts, others are derived from this and go out from my own understanding of who or what group of people strongly affected the events of modern history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every era, we can represent a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is less obvious is the question of whether it really were getting these people themselves that their steps autonom certain, or whether behind the throne was someone who drew their actions to a vorbestimmtes goal.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit that we live in a time, concentrated in the wealth of the world is in the hand less individual, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not created within the life span of a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Under these astronomisch stands out is a particularly rich families who could be described as the head of the kraken (I do not know whether anyone else is on them, I do not exclude this but) - the Rothschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Much is not written about you.</seg>
<seg id="15">Understandably.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) has been bought in the 1990s of the 19th century by the Rothschilds, to connect your name with hochkriminellen action to prevent, in whose background is consolidating its power, the proliferation of their assets or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and to the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, run wars or are these (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five countries, after the fall of ghaddafis remained just four, with Russia in the meantime, its central bank has the Russian government unterstellt).</seg>
<seg id="18">Whoever has tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as the central bank, began during the civil war, launch their own (read: state) notes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theatre.</seg>
<seg id="20">j.f. Kennedy began to launch their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; the member Louis MC fadden was poisoned after 1936 the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929, he wanted to sue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The global machtgelüste Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert pik, a freimaurer of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war was aimed, the big monarchistischen staatenwesen Europe to eliminate, by the second war should be especially broken Britain's colonial rule, and the third war should reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would not consume as many resources for their amenities and luxury concerns and would also create a universalreligion), (the ökumenismus here is nothing more than the run-up to) and eventually lead to the acquisition of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top is unleashing a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order from chao - order out of the chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to worsening of the situation (see foundation of the Fed, so that crises such as those of you in 1907 triggered not repeat).</seg>
<seg id="25">After it had succeeded in them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering the First World War, destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian zarenreiches, the war was no longer necessary), then, the resolution of the mitteleuropäischen großmacht österreich-ungarns.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the Second World War easier to spark ließen bankers by the policy a latent conflict, creating Germany with gigantic kriegsreparationen belegten; thus, they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they had to the German only a sufficiently strong leaders unterjubeln, which named the guilty and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the vielvölkerstaates Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, the function of a fifth column should take and also took to spark the kriegsbrand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, where a branch of establishing a judenstaates sought, as in the historic area judäas with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The aforementioned balfour-deklaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first clashes with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was terrorist attacks on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler from the chain losriss, on the the international bankers anfänglich had kept him, or if everything went according to plan, is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps laid the foundations for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the kriegsreparationen against Germany prepare the ground for the second world war, the declaration of the state of Israel was the creation of the brennpunktes for the third world war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers will be able to unleash the Jewish people will like this war in the second world war victims in the front kampflinie, this time together with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (one need only think, as sharply divided the people of supporters and opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is the culprit and who the victims in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where only wrong in an endless spiral of violence is wrong, and at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We must distinguish between the citizens of Israel and of its leadership here, but the international bankers are in Israel as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, the hawk, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, the international bankers loyal ergebenen politikers, doing everything to spark a war with Iran, which has given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan could extend...), soon became a global conflict, and where it due to Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide street run by hormus, about 20% of global oil supplies, could come to the deterioration of the global economy.</seg>

<seg id="2">In November 1979 besetzte a mob demonstrierender Islamist students the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">for their release they requested the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades was the patronage of his regime had maintained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the American Government, there was no positive way out of this situation - they could not afford the Shah jettison, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time she was not in a position to in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent disaster at the violent attempt the geiselbefreiung made it even worse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian Government had been.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods hervor.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat by Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film ARGO of the film director and actor Ben affleck describes an episode of this story, the US a small teilsieg bescherte.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before the occupation of the message, six botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">This ended after numerous complications in the residence of Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to bring the refugees from Iran; helped them an extravagant story to covering their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a drehorte filmstabes allegedly in the country for a science-fiction-film besuchte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Of the genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan developed by experts for "exfiltration," Tony Mendez, also made the cooperation Hollywood needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">So the camouflage was credible, erschienen article about this film in peer-reviewed journals, press conferences have been held, and the fictional production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">afflecks film is a special combination of several filmgenres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, it is a realistic politthriller, but at the same time, a so-called "caper movie," i.e., the story of a successful husarenstücks such as the film ocean's eleven.</seg>
<seg id="20">This change in the movie The stimmungsebenen - on the one hand, the dokumentarszenen from Tehran (iconic contemporary photographs shown in the title sequence, and there are no major differences in the filmfassung the same situations).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and slightly überspitzt therefore come.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there are the scenes from the cia-zentrale and other institutions - men in suits on besprechungstisch amtsfluren, on the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben affleck is a remarkable reboot his career with this film succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="24">From a belächelten actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">ARGO his third feature film after the crime is not easy (gone baby gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it is afflecks first film, not in the local Boston plays the director.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of the atmosphere of the place it was one of the features that the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood abhoben.</seg>
<seg id="28">affleck proves this sense but also in ARGO, where Tehran of Canada "played".</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - indeed the eingangssequenz the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, and it gives the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that comes when moving somewhere even history.</seg>
<seg id="30">affleck and his team achieved a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong filmstab at a bazaar in Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">act in too many places too much</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director also had to deal with that, that history is not many offers exciting scenes in cinematic terms.</seg>
<seg id="33">He works with the little but it quite successfully, and sometimes a bit of reality nachhilft - and then not always seems so elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America is averted, or even the chase on the runway, looked a bit curious).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of ARGO is his too widely-dispersed range, which is limited by the need to show too much in action in too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan arkin and John Goodman is very charming, but their characters have more space in their roles as hollywood-mitarbeiter deserves, and that they are in the film is far from alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">afflecks film loses it a little traction. It is a film that we watch with some interest and in the design and a thriller from the 70 years erinnernden retro-stil goutieren can.</seg>
<seg id="37">enthusiasm, it is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">Until now as a reminder of a living piece of history in some way and as evidence of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, however, he is sufficient.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, every year a survey on the absurdesten bankgebühren exclaims, has decided to hold the contest "most absurd regulation or idea from the eu-werkstatt" this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"On this idea brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of major European companies," said Patrik nacher to care about the organisation of this survey, the newspaper právo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nominees absurditäten is located, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of versicherungstarife for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until then genossen women in life insurance an advantage, because they are objectively less risk for insurance companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"More incredible attacks from the eu-werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The real vote will occur by the end of February 2013," said then.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">controversial regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol fuel, which in its result naturschädigend, furthermore, the prohibition of reliable quecksilberthermometer just because this is a relatively small amount of this gefahrenstoffes enthalten, or even the directive to the size of hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Criticism has in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butteraufstrich" or the marketing of conventional light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">bananas must be 14 inches long</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The eu-apparat entscheidet often under pressure from this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented by one or more Member States in Brussels (for example, currently trying the Czech Republic, also with veto-drohung demands Czech banks impose).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">lobby-interessen were also discovered that the highest handelsklasse bananas in the EU must be at least 14 inches long and should not have "krümmungsanomalie".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission defended themselves with the argument that it only the fragmented national standards harmonisiere that would impede trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The standards on fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries already with the note that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons in the sale must be provided with the note that children under eight years the balloon not without the supervision of an adult can inflate.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU stood in an American study, according to balloons are the leading cause of the death by asphyxiation of children.</seg>

<seg id="22">The Czech Republic überschritt then threatened for the volume for pilzkonserven, for which we have established a large fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them, but that they have no sea, or by the idea, to provide funding for applications for funding.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas were, however, not from Brussels, but from Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are disadvantaged by this, that we have no sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We in the EU will refund request," said in the autumn of 2004 the then agriculture minister Jaroslav palas (čssd).</seg>

<seg id="31">EU: bizarre regulations are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">regulations in the Member States are easy to target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also for effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserves according to some experts, however, more recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A more serious problem, according to the experts are more the eu-fördergelder for projects, which together with the deepening of European integration have nothing, but when the budget negotiations were imposed by individual Member States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Emotions calls in the fact that the Czech Republic similar to other Member States in Brussels must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">It is not about me, Senator or President to be.</seg>

<seg id="12">Later I have this clarified and said that I will run for the office of President, if I am elected senator.</seg>
<seg id="13">But my goal is not function. The function is an instrument, with whom I can do my vision.</seg>

<seg id="18">We are talking about their visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fight for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as retroactive vermögenserklärungen included over 20 million Crowns.</seg>
<seg id="20">You need to change laws.</seg>
<seg id="21">As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can table legislative proposals.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As ordinary citizens, I have argued that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone from the right or from the left with a good proposal is rejected, it is deliberately, and this keeps the population only.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent parteiloser I have a much greater potential to win support for all political parties represented in parliament.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without support in Parliament, you only keywords.</seg>
<seg id="39">And that brings you in politics in the long term not far away.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that you, if you only long enough to talk to the people, will be able to enforce the material and criminal liability, for example?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other option.</seg>
<seg id="42">To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them on our side, to achieve these goals.</seg>

<seg id="54">I have, for example with radim jančura spoken, but because arbeitsüberlastung refused.</seg>
<seg id="55">I also have the investigative journalist Jana lorencová supports, the fraud in the trade with light fuel oil aufdeckte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">My candidacy, I began with the condition that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty per cent of voters are not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">We are only two independent in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people have chosen such a senatszusammensetzung that changes will be very difficult to implement.</seg>
<seg id="60">Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example for the direct election of Mayors and bezirkshauptmänner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about setting up a separate party after?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not thought about this, because I don't have time to review the past each potentiellen parteimitglieds, and certainly do not have the money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I do not even have money for the präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account are only 20,000 kč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk about vermögenserklärungen, how would your?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">My wealth I appreciate to about 60 million kč.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a\ xC5 kodu superb, which is worth about one million. And then I have a few million on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Aston Martin was also a kindertraum - James Bond has always appealed to me, as he was in the car drove to women galant and at the same time fought against evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">They say that they want to change the Republic, but their own money you do not want to invest in it.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not particularly convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Should I make about debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I have 2.5 million put into the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is probably not too much interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to the campaign from its own resources to deny.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign will basically covered by my salary as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But the senatorengehalt I could not live alone, so I could for my son not the English school finance costs, the 30,000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I just wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">You're still continue to work as entrepreneurs, to have their livelihoods?</seg>
<seg id="81">Not, you said that these activities will be back?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But this is not linked to the level of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, I have my activities partially reduced.</seg>

<seg id="1">The mvrdv architects show that the real adventure are not only in the head - the example of spijkenisse and the recently errichteten bücherberg - 2 photos</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">"I find this funny, it looks futuristic buildings, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette verhaig, a passantin roadside.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan spermon, it-techniker in a nearby großbetrieb, says: "But, well, it is already the House."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder, what we still need a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">All have Internet, iPad and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">No man is still voluntarily in one of these old-style-bibliotheken, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">spijkenisse, a barely besichtigungsbedürftige schlafstadt at the gates of Rotterdam, is strange rekordhalter.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 80.000-einwohner-gemeinde has the lowest bildungsrate across the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To counter this stupid situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to the education and the seven fictional bridges, which are displayed on the euroscheinen than pretty bepinselte stahlbetonminiaturen nachzubauen.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the bildungsoffensive stayed in check.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so, recognized the stadtväter that there is only one way, the statistics to be Mr: a library to her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">winy Maas from Rotterdam architekturbüro mvrdv, master of tollkühnen balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen, sometimes cynical buildet, took the matter with his usual composure and appeared to wettbewerbs-hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on her face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury still verdutzt looked and with the achseln zuckte stapelte the cheeky Maas his exquisite mitbringsel the size to a pyramid and finished his aktionistisch untermauerte speech with the words: "love stadtgemeinde!"</seg>
<seg id="14">It is, therefore, my proposal for the bücherberg spijkenisse, for the so-called boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, of the 30 million Berg aufgeschüttet.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of a revitalisierungsprojekts, belong to the garage, supermarket, post office and a few neighbouring residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November, the bücherberg awarded the second prize "best library of NL 2012".</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, the project for the Dutch national wood award 2012 nominated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">This is not the faceless kleinstadtretorte, which until now had more to offer than a postmodern pedestriansed and a stunned hässliches radnice, behind the White walls would be inclined to suspect a molkereifabrik to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Above all, spijkenisse now has the first public kulturbau in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: büchereldorado under käseglocke.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is a lift, the right through the hills, but the real space and lesefreuden erschließen euphonix fußläufigen climb the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The rundum verglaste interior is bright and clear, the gebrannte klinkerboden and elegant straßenlaternen speak in the language of a public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is already looking for park bench, dog and boys and girls playing football.</seg>
<seg id="27">Everywhere and books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"normally, the bücherregale along the facade, and in the middle is a big, dark room, the most uncomfortable and impersonal," says winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have the classic raumkonfiguration on its head and the reading area from inside to outside. They</seg>
<seg id="30">The Interior of the bücherbergs is sent used: in the middle are offices, internet-bibliothek schachclub, umweltzentrum and haustechnikzentrale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A particular pleasure is the black bücherregale, the time wandverkleidung, sometimes brüstung, sometimes stiegengeländer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Look, feel and smell are foreign.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even die-hard architects and bauingenieure whether of the unknown baustoffs shake their heads.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," said joop trouborst, project manager at the borough spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we are in a friesländischen agrarbetrieb one day met with a suitable waste from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes kunststoffvlies as wurzelunterlage.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="44">donations for the new Soul</seg>

<p>
<seg id="45">"You would not believe it, but this House is in spite of the many glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology," says trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">heated and cooled with geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the bücherberg under a glassturz, the sun is shining even on sunny days only briefly into the interior.</seg>
<seg id="48">The broad holzleimbinder standing across the glass, serve as a shade and catch a large part of the sunlight.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already dared the way in the new library.</seg>

<seg id="53">And also the tcm-lehrerin cynthia bogarde, the boekenberg even as spijkenisses "long overdue soul."</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: to open a few weeks ago, each residents invited to donate a book from his personal collection.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is for the time being the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces - be filled.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept is caught on.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect winy Maas.</seg>

<seg id="1">szabo: "German must play greater role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen szabo, an expert on US-European relations, positioned Berlin for a narrow diplomatic level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then enthielt Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have not done.</seg>
<seg id="8">must now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.</seg>
<seg id="9">But, at the same time, I believe that it not supported the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained, when it came to set up a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was finally enforced by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, that is true.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy switches and away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">reflected the Germans are so between the fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">expected of them, that you have a more independent role, but they are not used to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think you buttons are still approach to their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">have a foreign policy, as France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What is a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy from economic policy is motivated, so of exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike that of the other great powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Had these interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.</seg>
<seg id="27">That is why it must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not to offend the.</seg>
<seg id="28">This plays a role in any case.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would also not want to attach too much importance to, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it plays an important role in any case in German thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by it has abstained on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe that, in Europe and even in the US there is great sympathy for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.</seg>
<seg id="35">But because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international player and its interests should be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States, on the other hand, have clearly in favour of a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are differences between the United States and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">As a result of American domestic politics these differences have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the government under Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, that position public.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real differences are not as big as they always appear.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so hellauf begeistert of Netanyahu's policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is difficult for Germany, its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other to agree?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">It would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead pushing things out of their own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">do precisely with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is, of course, not simply for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This has always been a sensitive issue.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I believe that the German, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself in the role as a major global player - Germany wants to assume a major role at all?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is Germany the lead still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still not used to it, it still is unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it difficult to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time Germany will assume a greater role, verschiedenste anti-deutsche feelings freely.</seg>
<seg id="57">This makes it the German not easy.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is actually the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be susceptible to various neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Now, the influence of the United States in European politics continuously from, the EU not fill this vacuum at the moment but who is otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you do not like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph lauren ebenfalls.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">behind it lies a in China officially registered name, but it has nothing to do with the ursprungsunternehmen.</seg>
<seg id="5">But it enjoys protection, as long as the actual namensgeber not complaints.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear whether you get right.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas pattloch, lawyer at the law firm Taylor wessing, which specializes in schutzrechtsverletzungen in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week a new case ends up on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The nachahmern rich already a few additional letters, so that they can register their brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">It will be held from simply lu-gucci Gucci, Prada is prada-kny eintragen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also German companies are legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturers PUMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">pattloch opens a folder with eintragungen of markenamts in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010, where a Chinese company the trademark zegna df PUMA to protect a kunstnamen, which is also the fashion company ermenegildo zegna bediente.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That the Chinese world champion in the copy and the injured are intellectual property, is known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities there are multistory department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.</seg>
<seg id="16">pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his clients before he goes against that Chinese companies from markenamt officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call this "bâng mingpai," a beifahrermarke.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word is based on "bâng dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">that women are meant, the rich men fishing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"This is geschäftsschädigend, we must combat it," fordert pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand is watered down, the alleinstellung disappears, the imageschaden is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the costs of the industries are in the millions, especially in expensive vorzeigeprodukten.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the marktforschungsgesellschaft clsa is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But löschungen dubioser entries in markenregister are hard to reach and go to the money.</seg>
<seg id="26">up to nine years can last for the procedure, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">pattloch reports of cases in which the Court complaints abwies because, after the long duration of beanstandete name to "marktrealität" had become.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff must have bad luck, he even the plagiator pay money, because his brand in China injured, says pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">famous cases concern graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the baumaschinenhersteller sany, the company that recently the German betonpumpenbauer putzmeister übernahm.</seg>
<seg id="32">resembles the Chinese must therefore until today use of an emblem that the mercedes-stern.</seg>
<seg id="33">The volvo-käufer geely used originally a blau-weißes logo, the BMW remembered; the dispute was resolved, geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The modehersteller Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile schauen ließen in the other direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.</seg>
<seg id="36">While this markenamt ctmo in Beijing is that there 2010 due to lower personnel and raumausstattung bottlenecks have given.</seg>
<seg id="37">But last year was one of the "emergency in workflow returned to normal life."</seg>
<seg id="38">It is the bestand unbearbeiteter einspruchsverfahren dropped by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Yet in the office are still waiting 81.500 objections on erledigung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">tackle costs a lot against</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year, the ctmo more than 1.4 million applications for protection, almost a third more than 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record for the tenth consecutive year, the list of capabilities around the world lead, and means that China shares with the authority.</seg>
<seg id="45">That also holds true for the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="46">2011 were 1.8 billion yuan in fees have been taken.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simplified, it means that any application on average 1280 yuan or costs 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To confront this costs many times, as the case of the German company freudenberg shows.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years, the group fighting against a Chinese plagiator.</seg>
<seg id="50">While the German could achieve that its illegal manufacture imitierter kraftfahrzeugteile ausgehoben was.</seg>
<seg id="51">But secured the nachahmer continues to the Chinese rights to the brand freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">We have failed to do this, because in Germany familiennamen could not be protected, says hanno wentzler freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich, chairman of the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="53">The markenamt ctmo dismissed the appeal of the Munich because back.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the next two bodies got freudenberg right, but the prozessgegner still fighting today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">We must höllisch careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The matter is now before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">wentzler is confident, to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: "the process is extremely complex and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs could be hardly put the firmenarchiv have even one hundred years old files must review, to provide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, freudenberg the other side in vain a "high sechsstelligen eurobetrag" to resolve.</seg>
<seg id="61">"This shows you how much we value is," says wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">zurückzuschwappen the dangers in the Far East threaten even to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is, if there imitatoren vulnerable brands ensure.</seg>
<seg id="64">So wanted a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, the name freudenberg for shoes and leather anmelden.</seg>
<seg id="65">This business has long abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">höllisch must be careful," says wentzler."</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the lawyer pattloch raten German companies to be very careful in doing business with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, but if the foreigners "everything is somehow schützenswert anmelden, even in China," as wentzler says.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact, if freudenberg in the last act of his markendramas unterliege, it would probably be the other side pay royalties for its own name, said wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we will in the segment squeezed out of the market in question.</seg>

<seg id="6">Only then, the voices of singers slowly - old, bass, tenor and soprano - bedrängen, find and track.</seg>
<seg id="7">And fiete hopf, the 29-jährigen conductors, makes it almost from its stoffschuhen, if it brings together with its smooth wild gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is Monday night, the choir in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg probt imbongi a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">about fifty singers have come between 23 and 69 years old, from the humangenetikerin to hausmann.</seg>
<seg id="10">"om 'obani" is not an easy piece, every chorstimme has a different text and also in a very foreign language: zulu, the 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland is spoken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">To help themselves</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">There are about 34 million people worldwide, the UNAIDS estimates, the program of the United Nations to bekämfung AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million people of them live in South Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">live in Swaziland 245000 aidswaisen.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than 40 percent of the population have now HIV positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 aidswaisen in the village esitjeni has the Association voices for Africa sponsors found in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them visit a secondary school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros a month you can have a patenschaft übernehmen.</seg>
<seg id="19">It guarantees the child school, school uniform and a hot meal every day in gogo-center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">imbongi means in zulu storyteller or lobpreiser.</seg>
<seg id="21">The bantusprache fließend can speak in this space, no one but sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For nearly ten years, the choir songs in this foreign soft language and brings you back then, where they originally come from: from time to time in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because 8 733 kilometers luftlinie of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village esitjeni that depends on the stimmgewalt of German Choir.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple lehm- and strohhütten, a majority of them are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them have no more parents, because they are the HIV succumbed.</seg>
<seg id="27">In esitjeni shows up in the small, woran quite Swaziland krankt: highest hiv-infektionsrate lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">Restrictions on the male foreskin, the ansteckungsrisiko nachweislich cut by half, of the population hardly be adopted.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland are the immunschwäche-virus, with center 30 to die is not unusual.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In a common afrika-reise discovered the choir in spring 2005 the village, but above all, saw the imbongis many children on the streets, which not only lacked parental care, but simply of everything: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">leaving school without qualifications has been in a poor country certainly no chance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a hot meal a day.</seg>
<seg id="33">But just a year later, the choir the association "voices for Africa," which is almost professionally takes care of the AIDS orphans in esitjeni since then.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">facts to sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">To the bacterial STI zählen syphilis, chlamidia and tripper (gonorrhö).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent virale STI are HIV, humane pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">crab and itch are among the parasitic STI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who are the hauptbetroffenengruppen?</seg>
<seg id="40">syphilis and tripper are mainly in men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The robert-koch-institut assumes that at least four out of five of all in Germany reported syphilis-fälle transmitted through sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the heterosexual adults are chlamydien-infektionen trichomonads candidose (mushroom), tripper and humane pappilomaviren often occurring sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in relatively small - yet: about 20 percent of the hiv-neuinfektionen accounts for this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among young people treten chlamydien-infektionen much more frequent than in other communities.</seg>
<seg id="45">After European surveys refer to three quarters of all infections young people between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">Here are also humane pappilomaviren among young people often before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As has the number of infections developed?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of syphilis-infektionen, according to the robert-koch-institut of 1697 erkrankungen in 2001 to 3698 erkrankungen in 2011 more than doubled.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of hiv-neuinfektionen goes back since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">2011 there were some 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about a tenth less than a year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The symptoms indicate a geschlechtskrankheit?</seg>
<seg id="54">The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints to the urinieren ausfluss, unterbauchschmerzen and blisters or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">But often they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How you can protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">As part of the pathogen sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed through schmierinfektionen and close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">experts recommend that, especially in frequently changing sexpartnern regular investigations.</seg>
<seg id="60">Early diagnosed most STI cured and complications can be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">By patenschaften, donations and, last but not least the gagen, which the choir in Germany ersingt, some comes together.</seg>
<seg id="62">"overall, we have already sent about 200 000 euros after esitjeni," says Annette lennartz, the chairman of the Association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village itself managed zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, the money from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">They also cares that the orphans unterkommen well, at one of the grandmothers about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The gogos, how the old women in zulu called, are the base of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have up to 14 orphans at aufgenommen, give you a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear every day just in time for school.</seg>
<seg id="67">Anyone who has nobody comes to schutzhaus khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two cooks, the every day for more than 200 hungry children cooking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition," voices for Africa "launched a nähschule, two hühnerhäuser built and together with the American gesundheitsorganisation PSI organisiert make that many in the village have an HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not to be taken for granted, because the disease across the country also is so obvious, it is silent on loved ones dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">a king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Actually remarkable in a country in which the King officially 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">polygamy of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Among other things, it is also due to the officially sanctioned way of life that the HIV in recent decades has spread so quickly.</seg>
<seg id="76">But also the many migrant workers, carry the virus around the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms there would be on every corner, says Annette lennartz," but the rarely used.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is different - in flesh to flesh."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to promote the cultural exchange something, the imbongi-chor travels every two or three years together by the South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black selbstbewusstsein that many on the southern tip of the black continent still know from the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">a bus full of white, singing the songs in a black language - so much recognition is not only mood and joy, but has also been some fierce abgetrotzt grenzsoldaten some tears.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The journey is always after esitjeni, where the singer visit their own.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even if the small village on landkarten hardly findet, in the valley of the ezulweni-flusses is more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"After esitjeni, there is the light," say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And if the 8733 kilometer luftlinie to Heidelberg returns to the pumping singers in the rehearsal room on the bergheimer street lights, then you can see it here.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="50">Our insights into space: the most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope will 1608 have been invented by Hans lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei it a year later to sternenbeobachtung began.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes are growing - and the insights they provide, deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the hale-teleskop in palomar-observatorium near San Diego the largest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, USA, is the large binocular telescope telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">It can look into all equal about two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.</seg>

<seg id="59">, he achieved a diameter of about 11 meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">detriment of cheap design: the telescope is in his elevation festgezurrt - and thus limited in his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Also the hobby-eberly-teleskop in Texas is fixed in elevation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its feature: the high lichtsammelkraft.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is - despite comparatively low spiegeldurchmesser - to the world's largest spiegelteleskope approaches.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the help of a radioteleskops in arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers hear it all for alien signals.</seg>

<seg id="1">rakfisk from Norway: is the übelriechendste fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but around the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Could the secret of success of the country have anything to do with the local appetite for fairly übelriechenden fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a selection überreifer cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">One place you in the middle of a pile of dirty, humid sportswear.</seg>
<seg id="6">and leave you there a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just about must be the nasenbetäubenden smell of rakfisk vorstellen, one of the great delights of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I find myself in the small town of fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which simply will not disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which - depending on how stinkend its fish would have you believe - up to a year in water fermentiert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">When the darkness in Norway on the country, and the weather is colder, strömen Norwegians to a celebration here in fagernes, this is dedicated to, well, really very impressive specialty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"you can eat it raw and then into it with a glass of aquavit down," says havard halvarsen, actually in the local feuerwache works, but as a so-called "rakfisk-general" the festival was held.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">around us people eat small fischwürfel and take large amounts of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"mansche people dislike the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The spirituose can replace the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I eat some bites.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it avoids rakfisk in nasennähe to bring, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride behind it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian epoche, when there was no kühlmöglichkeiten and fish in the autumn in air-tight salzwasserfässern was drenched.</seg>
<seg id="19">In deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol gedämpften senses - consumed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and traveled mainly in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a buoyant labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not too long ago was much richer than Norway, strömen immigrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, if strictly riechender part of Norwegian history.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.</seg>
<seg id="25">But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud EUR\ xC2 10.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not often in the world's media, and most people this does not seem to disturb.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here hasst it still, different Breivik to name - those racist right-wing extremists, the 77 men, women and children, last year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, it is only to the "incident on 22\ xC2 July."</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in your peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Norway is primarily responsible for today's wealth since the early 1970's, the growth of the world's largest oil and gasindustrien.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason why it is us so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with reifem rakfisk distributed and with her long blond hair and the pungent blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are, as the saying goes - sensible people.</seg>
<seg id="33">her English is just like the most people here makellos.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are not very angeberisch, we may not bragging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - dealt a large part of the branchenerträge is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As in the years up to the global economic crisis, all with money to throw, it does not owned Norway his wallet firmly closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"as long as we can go skiing in the winter and summer hiking, we are happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"and of course rakfisk eat," adds you with unbeschwertem laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am in the snow and am for another court - from rakfisk I have enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">So a elch-burger is in any case something else. The juicy meat mundet me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But in the evening is again the stinkefisch on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several locations, which organise a rakfisk-dinner, in which guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging geruchssinne - fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a live-tv-schaltung with a fly bekleideten showmaster, of plates with rakfisk is surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="44">The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What are your score up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor-jürgen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here are our points, havard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">You klatscht and laughs.</seg>

<seg id="6">On Saturday, Mexico's New President Enrique pena held the präsidentenbinde received and the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He is facing a complex task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Under the outgoing government Felipe calderons, Mexico can work well economically, but the country is in the grip of a drogenkriegs, which already has claimed 60,000 lives in the past six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My Government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," said pena held earlier this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he went on an equal footing with the US President, was pena held as Governor of his heimatstaats Mexico tätig.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this densely populated, large part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the divided opinions about the new head of state.</seg>

<seg id="16">In order to achieve the city, you can go on one of the highways, the pena nieto build, and are a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that were here once.</seg>
<seg id="17">plaques with his name are outside of a modern sportcentrum and of an impressive interactive museum on climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect him real and lasting changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel pena nietos olvera Hernandez, a congressman for the party, the PRI works.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular, with regard to the security and economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 replaced by Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Congressman olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside of the Los pinos präsidentenpalasts great expectations of Enrique pena held.</seg>
<seg id="22">Accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He is a very direct person, very committed and have big plans for the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was a great statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the state not many people share that view of their former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In association, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del bravo could not be greater.</seg>
<seg id="27">The place is hidden under autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the Community are of crucial urban nature.</seg>

<seg id="31">During the term of Governor pena held were murdered in the state of Mexico, more than 1,000 women - a statistic that exceeds even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The critics pena nietos are of the opinion that he at least is not adequately addressed the problem of murders during his term.</seg>
<seg id="33">But in the worst case have his government closed their eyes to the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete, typical of the heruntergekommene quarter, fighting irinea buendia with tears, as it shows me photos of their late daughter Mariana Luna.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="36">But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived in your home, it seemed as if your body was washed," recalls senora buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs that they had been beaten, and the leichenstarre had already used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While their mother tells their story, looks from the Wall a picture of Mariana down on us. It is next to a cross angebracht that wears a single word: justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is precisely this, so the family, have been denied her until now.</seg>

<seg id="1">My mexikanisch-amerikanische identity crisis.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Many people were due to the lack of opportunities forced to leave Mexico</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they remind them hard times, he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">navarrette is of the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, as confusion in made me wide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs pointed to two queues: one for "de" ("Mexicans"), another for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in zentralkalifornien and was my whole life "Mexicans".</seg>
<seg id="9">An ethnic kürzel - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or call my friends in New York "Italians."</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I opted for "mexikanisch-amerikanisch."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in my grandfather's home there was no need for kürzeln or hyphens,.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just Americans.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish, at least good enough to get me into this language on both ends of an interview to say.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the vocabulary of a muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about that moment this week after, when the future Mexican President Enrique pena nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were all those issues, which we expected, when the heads of these two countries meeting: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">pena held was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans now as high likely to remain in Mexico, rather than to emigrate to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would like to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc to model of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And pena nieto vowed to continue the Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even if he mentioned no details on this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of ressentiment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never waste a single idea in mind that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and forced to leave you more than half its territory by vorgehaltenem rifle to the leadership of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, in centuries and not think in minutes, are memories of this event not to miss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore, once a us-regierungsbeamter even mildeste criticism of Mexico is, we hear - and among the elite of the country - in the Mexican press complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour bedrängen.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children montezumas proceeded on the kriegspfad.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet is the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">want to talk about resentment?</seg>
<seg id="29">There is more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has winners and losers. people, for the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or großelternteil - who got offered no chance in Mexico and towards the North.</seg>
<seg id="32">And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is you.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And although we may now have visited the American dream life, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, we live - not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is sometimes be blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is clearly the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leaders do not like.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is based on reciprocity.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a memorial a humiliating defeat and look down upon us, because we are not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never good enough, our ties with Mexico never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">arguing that our existence is a symbol of failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families not in Mexico failed, they would not be gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And then we would not now see caught behind the seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally in the United States as a child einwanderte, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans take them this evil.</seg>
<seg id="46">While American citizen is, sees you as part of two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country to belong.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the Mexican band Los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we will be seen as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the bildungsbürgertums would resume their ties to the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">You want to Mexican Americans as a provisional "Ambassador" for Mexico to represent their interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American colleagues about it, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leadership to step up their ties to Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Now.</seg>
<seg id="56">It will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many injured feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And in view of the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I fear, because you alone by, friends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to make the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, you must also accept that some Mexican Americans a resentment for, as have their family members were only treated not so long ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are "Mexican," than I thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old fighting, New Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The truce between Israel and Hamas could prove unexpected foundation for the Peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can it ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest bloody events seem such a hope to nip in the bud.</seg>
<seg id="5">Amid the usual recriminations were zahllose buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and embarked on the Holy City of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But, while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in its historic conflict, is changing the Middle East around them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">won a war that neither lost nor is</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance seems optimism, given the current situation anything other than appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21\ xC2 November continues, have strengthened the dieswöchigen kämpfe the hardcore on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, even though his group had to even large loss.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although several Hamas killed and 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and dense bevölkertesten eingepfercht corners of the planet, it is Israel until now have not been able to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, added Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate palästinensergruppe Fatah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">And the Hamas could conclude that you have time on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends can draw on their side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power that once was as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken for the Hamas party - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most powerful Gulf States.</seg>
<seg id="19">jubelnde hamas-anhänger believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent is - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren prägung stürzung Bashar Assad's face, to Jordan, where hamas-verbündete could threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Under President Muhammad mursi and in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt - by far the einwohnerstärksten and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall 2011, had little time left for Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders more dependent on volksansichten.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic negotiations could prove player Hamas, even by Israel and the United States cannot be herausgedrängt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Israeli hardliners, however, can draw the opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">Militarily, Hamas is no longer a danger.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli missile defence system," Iron dome," can prove has, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">At least for a while, Israel is quiet can sleep.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic terms, the United States unwavering in their position and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest gewalteskalationen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the sperranlagen, in the West Bank and therefore in the body of an eventual Palestinian State hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared illegal under international law, but continue to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Netanyahu is as well. His Likud party has in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren allied group.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why this hinterlistigen Palestinians verhätscheln and handed them a state of their own?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you actually have control over the West Bank, they would not like their supporters in Gaza and rockets firing?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, it is better to keep it behind the wall in check and to punish, if you dare to raise the heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will prevail. But the Arab Spring could make them a win in the final.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries in seats, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israel's verteidigungsetat is larger than of his four Arab neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments little help to repair its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the pragmatic President mursi with Barack Obama zusammentat, in order to achieve a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era symbolisieren.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also Israelis should long-term thinking.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the rest of the Arab world take tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue their selbstbestimmungsrechtes deprived - a powder keg, which no doubt will one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, as well as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">The oppression already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.</seg>
<seg id="43">bloody missions to suppression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years will increasingly take its diplomatic toll.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a boost from outside</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The right answer is that the vernünftigeren representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and is represented by this newspaper: two states, where Israel for security purposes gebiete abtritt.</seg>
<seg id="46">The hope is that the cease-fire outsiders - for the near future small - granted more power to enforce this solution.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt must now together with Turkey and Qatar the arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to stop Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.</seg>
<seg id="48">Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming un-beobachterstatus application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Obama must also play its part, to encourage Israel to negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term he failed the idea of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">far away in the White House, it seems as if it were just a participation averse.</seg>
<seg id="53">But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Time to be bored in a constantly elektrisierten world it is beautiful,</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems turned out and we had to wait for another plane.</seg>
<seg id="3">So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts on boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iphones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But more and more academics and kindesentwicklungsexperten führen boredom as something positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">When it comes to you, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, potentially promotes creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, we will no longer benefit from the advantages of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">So we should the boredom welcome with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">This I come back again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure.</seg>
<seg id="15">But Peter toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "boredom: a lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011), it is not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Indeed, the boredom has a very long history," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">The hauswände pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is the question of how we define boredom actually.</seg>
<seg id="19">John D. eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York In Ontario, Canada, that is the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After a long reading forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea before a fokusgruppe of about 100 people Professor eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as they want to experience," a satisfactory activity, but this cannot be able to "define.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">boredom is different from apathy, therefore, to the effect that the person is not employed, but that would be.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to "disruption of the aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">boredom is therefore almost as to listen to as depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor eastwood believes that although these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes, we believe that US is boring, even if we only have difficulties to focus.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their study," the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention "- in English, about:" The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention, "which was published in September in The Journal perspectives on psychological Science", Professor eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants zuhörten tape, on which a person a magazinartikel vorlas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard a loud TV from the neighbouring region that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group had heard these sounds not at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The people who barely audible television heard, made to feel more bored than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If you try to concentrate on a difficult and demanding job, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says mark J. fenske, Associate Professor of neuroscience at the University of guelph In Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">If you prefer a monotonous work exercised - "as the search for faulty products to a fabrikförderband, music can distract and help, not to feel bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he says, we now know that herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, this can even fight by people physically remain attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"studies have shown that children who herumhampeln dürfen, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sitting still," says Professor fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">All of us will eventually boring - my late flight, a dröhnender speakers, a particularly ermüdender film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people get bored more easily than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">In order to measure these differences, researchers have developed a "scale in the 1980s to langeweileanfälligkeit."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On the scale are statements such as "many of the things I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using such scales, researchers found that young is more boring than girls, so Stephen vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of westflorida - particularly with regard to the need for more and greater diversity externer reize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter haufen.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment by, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32% of teenagers in school were doing homework and the bored, while 23% data to be bored, if they were not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">But only 3% of parents gave, to feel bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages are about boredom increase or decrease.</seg>
<seg id="44">He was sure, however, that "the youth is seen as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on your alltagsablauf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">back to my ursprungsfrage: boredom is healthy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to relieve them - the studies have shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"with the boredom to the brain a saying that we should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain do not always know what you should do it best.</seg>
<seg id="50">If one is boring and you use this energy to play guitar and to cook, will be happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">But television can provide glücksgefühle in the short term, but these verflüchtigen long-term again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So who's bored child an iPad is enough, but they can turn it off the boredom. It has not learned to talk or to control themselves, says Professor fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And he adds: "selbstkontrolle transfers from one situation to the other."</seg>
<seg id="54">The child learns not only to entertain, but also receives more selbstkontrolle in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not believe that we should boredom celebrate.</seg>
<seg id="56">We should also not see too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead, our aim should be to us off the permanent aktivitäts- and technologieberieselung wohlzufühlen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor eastwood agrees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"It sounds so as to be more boring to us. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something useful," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">He believes that the people in truth only look for a way to shut down and relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"in an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to beschäftigen, once the noise is silent."</seg>

<seg id="1">In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marihuanagesetz</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The 19-jährige Community college-student footballer Anthony orozco atbilstošs sdosten colorados for a crime in court, which will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few marihuanabrocken and a pipe that they smoked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">According to orozco, he and some friends on a septembertag travelling by car in lamar near the Kansas border, when they were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officers found marijuana in the car, was orozco for the possession of drugs and drogenutensilien vorgeladen - kavaliersdelikte, which are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and received a gerichtstermin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are treated like criminals," so orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But he is also a?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drogendelikte less from the law, as the location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of offences that will turn to marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, the approved similar measures, already dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police no longer pursue adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally allowed, as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in the more conservative districts colorados have announced that existing marihuanadelikte weiterzuverfolgen quote and people are still in court.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time are voting on it several cities, from the suburbs denvers to the western mountains, new, state licensed marihuanageschäfte to stop at the opening in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"this situation is evolving so rapidly, that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. oates, chief of police in aurora, which lies east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">And regulators in Washington State kratzen perplexed at the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are waiting for a guide on the establishment of a lizenzsystems for production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and we have a deadline until 1 December 2013 in mind.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado is ahead in any case, most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. There was only the drug for medical purposes and then the eigenkonsum legalised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for guidance," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the authority for spirits in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide to serve.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent, which we can follow," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, called i-502, enters into force on 6 December and this is also the conclusion of a grey area, in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalised.</seg>
<seg id="20">And unpleasant praxisfragen must be resolved in this time - for example, how the government target of a "fair access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres to schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"No, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the conurbation of Seattle," says Ben livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November, chief oates sent his staff in aurora, an e-mail in which he said that the Public Prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marihuanadelikte in people over 21 years, and that the police will pursue "immediately" no strafanzeigen for these offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban vorgaben to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue to pursue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In weld county in the north colorados represents bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken buck a stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he gave to his authority would continue to monitor cases of marihuanabesitz, mainly to persuade consumers to withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently, 119 people prosecuted for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many were also charged for other offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our authority has a duty to pursue violations, which are the tatzeitpunkt were crimes," ließ buck said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa county, where voters rejected the marihuana-initiative ambivalent.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in grand junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults for the possession of small quantities no longer.</seg>
<seg id="30">bezirksstaatsanwalt pete hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided to not all outstanding besitzverfahren to drop.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not believe that I don't waste my time on this, to enforce the law until it changes," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, has been clear from the start that it would not be easy to arrange the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the conflicting reactions throughout the State encouraged among local officials a profound dichotomy in terms of the big green experiment to days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In bezirksstaatsanwälten if it was a "cultural barrier," said Sean mcallister, a lawyer from Denver for marihuanadelikte stehende defendants in court, and on the ground as a spokesperson for the National Organization for the reform of marihuanagesetzen operates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"You have such a big part of their lives to prosecute people for that they spent the legalisierung still cannot accept," he believes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The first states that treat small quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington as a national musterfälle acted for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sale, at the same time, nervous wait for instructions from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to treat as a crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of the legalisierungsbewegung hope that the justice department will give in.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several aufsehenerregender defends arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States largely gestattet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Kevin A. sabet, former drogenpolitik-berater the Obama administration believes that kriminalbeamte is likely to be no doors of small quantities of the drugs, but probably reluctant to seize the legal under the new legislation, staatlich regulated marihuana-geschäfte to tolerate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the election day genehmigten some local administrators moratoriums on new marihuana-geschäfte, although this could open only in about a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week, montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to get into a position in which we license and then someone at the federal level are facing a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a Member of the town council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our Community has voted against this change.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are then, for what the Community has decided and not after, for which the state has decided.</seg>

<seg id="1">petronella Wyatt: I was in Oxford to, because I am Tory</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only university students of today are attacked for their views</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">been it has always been my biggest dream, to get a place at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had visited the University, which I once considered the world's largest wissenstempel, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance - promoted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But within two weeks after my arrival in worscester college - there in the late 1980s, I had intended to study history - I had my suitcase and found as the first scandal of my life again.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father broke out in tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The evening standard said it, I would be gone, because I would have had a problem with that fellow students in neighbouring rooms had sex.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author a n Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged Cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the truth was less amusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">. I ran</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I had been harassed for one reason only - a reason, in this alleged birthplace of enlightenment so blinkered and cruel seemed now: my late father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and I have been in favour of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why do I mention this now?</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, according to recent reports, is a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The organised and increasing hatred of tory-studenten in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week the same gleichberechtigungsschutz forderte, benefits the schwulen, disabled people and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative Members of the corpus Christi college junior common room (JCR) indicate that they are because of their political views "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable."</seg>
<seg id="19">They call for a place in the gleichberechtigungskomitee your college, in order to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The situation was exacerbated by a recent ausgestrahlte documentation on political students on BBC two," Wonderland: young, bright and on the right," was the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was shown, among other things, absolvent Joe cooke, a former President of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, in a Rolls-Royce and rode with silver suit and silberbesetztem gehstock protzte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">at other universities say conservative students, they are regarded as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".</seg>
<seg id="23">The 20-year-old luke black, Vice-President of the conservative studentenvereinigung of the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper said: "there is a growing linkstendenz at universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people believe that we are like the bullingdon club, without us even kennengelernt."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21 and geschichtsstudent in corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the view that such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-jährige stephanie cherill, president designate of the conservative student association of Oxford says she observed in jcr-mitgliedern a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of Members," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In my first weeks in Oxford, I was such a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">arrived as unbelievably timid 18-jährige I was in September 1986.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year the university had voted in favour, Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education to give no title.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would have even stalinisten aufschrecken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the erstsemester-woche, in the new students and tutors kennelernen, I received a taste of the future events.</seg>
<seg id="33">I made the experience that the tutors the mockery of tory-studenten not only duldeten, but even with pleasure take part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">political issues such as bergarbeiterstreik, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa had found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutoriums.</seg>
<seg id="35">In my first of these events should translate into English. I French texts from the 18th century to what then should have been taken, I was not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."</seg>
<seg id="37">I stumbled.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt was a small man with a face as from kuchenteig, and quite gehässig.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"refuse thatcher-anhänger, to learn French, or are you just stupid?" he asked me.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students kicherten.</seg>
<seg id="41">wallten tears in my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that you take a few französischstunden in their leisure time - so, if you are not too busy with their social activities," knurrte me Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned with hängendem head back in my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">On this evening, I sat alone at dinner, as I have been easy on the shoulder tippte in college.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was a englischstudent from the second year called James, who is a member of the Conservative student Association presented.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it is, as it is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is harassed.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is bad enough, but you know that your father Margaret Thatcher nahesteht, so it will be worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most tory-erstsemester pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In a local pub I tried later to adjust me.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs. Thatcher was in all respects.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick should prove unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="54">A new entrant in the field as Conservative philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, the current Eton College had visited, said to me: "You're the daughter of a faschistenschweins."</seg>
<seg id="55">polluted you.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students shared his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverse and dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"As Tories have sex?" asked me one.</seg>
<seg id="59">The beat each other, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt as homosexuals in the more liberal legislation of the United States felt had to have.</seg>
<seg id="61">Would I ever be able, at the University of Oxford to lead a normal life?</seg>
<seg id="62">I would talk only after nightfall can make?</seg>
<seg id="63">Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclinations to suppress?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years that lay before me, began before my inner eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only tutor, who openly admitted as a Tory, was Norman stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was not only for this to be a conservative, but also because he hated Thatcher in terms of foreign policy advice and had written for you talk.</seg>
<seg id="67">He was only rarely there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place, found him parochial and kleinkariert and rejected him for his marxistisch-deterministische geschichtsperspektive.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he took a professorship at the University of bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You will not be happy here," he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I started to commute between Oxford and the House my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.</seg>
<seg id="72">My father told me that I Oxford hated, and why I did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">He seemed disbelief.</seg>
<seg id="74">accepted during his time in the vierzigern were all political views.</seg>
<seg id="75">"but it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.</seg>
<seg id="76">So, not something they would never do in my city of träumenden spire.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners on the day.</seg>
<seg id="78">His moist eyes trübten.</seg>
<seg id="79">Give the whole a chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure you neckt you only.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break my heart, if you gingst.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.</seg>
<seg id="83">One of my male friends, also tory-anhänger, had buckled under pressure and his convictions entsagt.</seg>
<seg id="84">During a tutoriums in the following week, in which another geschichtstutor seriously had said that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Although I secretly zerging in shame, I was that my parents were subjected to "brainwashing" and called them "old idiot."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The relief lasted only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was my father, the final nail in the coffin of my oxford-karriere schlug.</seg>
<seg id="88">At the time he wrote two columns in the murdoch-presse per week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was closed.</seg>
<seg id="90">I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my häscher on.</seg>
<seg id="91">As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">You can like a weinerlichen schlappschwanz nennen.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no 18-jährige should ever in a school under such intimidation and boshaftigkeit must suffer.</seg>
<seg id="95">And even more tragic is that it was, a University of Oxford, which not only 14 tory-premierminister hervorbrachte, but up to now hiding behind a windfall reputation of equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="6">This exhibition is the conclusion of a history, whose single protagonist "Il signore garavani" could have been written, but not without its distinguierte clientele.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Valentino had always been fascination for the stifling and distant world of the adels.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the first room of the exhibition, which continues until March 3, will be to see, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the erlesensten aristocracy, starting from the Princess salimah Aga Khan, about the Princess marie-chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord snowdon.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="7">The advertising agency bbh, which has shot the video, is the hope that the advertising achieved in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it a fun and funny.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is the biggest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">The fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue to which we have had to take care of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromonen or the organisation of speed-dating-abenden (fast flirting).</seg>
<seg id="13">possible that many of these ideas were creative, you, but not necessarily to success.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap to compose?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If this issue is not easy, is the Government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every year it is 1,300 dollars for political measures to encourage the citizens to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A package of government for married couples and parents granted up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But everything so far had little success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich, hochtechnologischer city-state in South-East Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In its national bevölkerungsbehörde, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time, as this rate on 2 fraud - which is also known as ersetzungsrate - was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why not get the singapurer more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of national bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this was due to a "better education" and "greater career opportunities".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This has allowed the people, except to marry and to form a family to have far more options in relation to lebensziele and to set priorities," she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single and the delay marriage and geburten, whose outcome is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, an immigration policy, aimed at a drastic increase in zuwanderungen to counteract the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are websites, where the little kaschierte xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese, to be criticised for keeping wages low and not integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the elections was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the falling birth rate the known impact on economic growth of a nation, the tax revenue, the cost of health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore has unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">It has already have an impact on the housing market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Agency for urban development has started to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "schuhschachteln" and can be built in certain areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments are an area of 46 square meters and show a great success in terms of sales.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, there is the concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single, and that they discourage the construction of large apartment for families to build.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew soon, Director-General of the real estate company El developers, says that his "schuhschachteln" much faster than larger apartments sell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units.</seg>
<seg id="40">This means that you are very much better for our cash flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">He is, however, that the new standards the developers clearer guidelines, which had previously been put obstacles in the way, if you too many small units in a project to build.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stress</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate is the talks with the singapurern, working in the financial district, to show that they will not have a major impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"The people are very stressed, the housing and education are expensive, which is why it is delayed by many," says a young manager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The children can get other.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women lead their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that you cannot have children.</seg>

<seg id="1">"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, where "South America can actually learn something from Europe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, of the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) participated, which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "in the Second World War and other conflicts umbrachten" and "are practically a homeland today."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, the Member States of the UNASUR forward.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; there are still, however, reactionary sectors, seeking a return to the past," he warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The President also advocated Ecuador the redesign of the Organisation of American States (oea) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The lessons, undertake never to something, and in return we sign the South Americans everything.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted the Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa said that he does not regret this decision, because he was so as not to betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights" has fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that it was "reasonable suspicions have given that Assange be delivered to a third country and procedures would not observed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He also criticised the Swedish prosecutors have demanded of him, to give him an interrogation on its territory because of alleged sexualdelikts, while "the Swedish legislation allows this via a video conference, which could have been carried out on the Embassy of Ecuador in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental state of Assange would be compromised.</seg>
<seg id="13">"since he is in our message is, I have not spoken to him, the Ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the head of state in Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">However, there is a danger that he take physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a narrow space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="15">"that would affect the health of every people," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa was that the solution to the asylum, which was granted Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London since the month of June, the granting of a freibriefs is, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that Europe's lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities. He stressed that there had been talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not act with human rights, we are this word in this case not to, there have been constant discussions, however.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, baltazar Garzón, a number of procedures at various European bodies leads," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And "if Britain this licence granted tomorrow, I believe that this is done."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or Skype verhörte, as it allows the Swedish law and was made in other cases, the problem is finished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he can tolerate," the mediocrity, not the evil intention and dispel the lie, the freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the greatest enemies of freedom of the press is not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In that sense it beglückwünschte that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists', and not by the bankers or hegemonischen and spießbürgerlichen countries," and took vorweg that he is in a re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the UNASUR at least up to the next elections, and he argued that the body "must be hard and not opportunism and not as legal verkleideten coup stattgeben darf," because it "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The President of Ecuador is also keeping the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the verdict of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua bevorteilte to negotiate with Nicaragua seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, for "absolutely right."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Currently this judgment is not being implemented.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between a South and Central American state.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.</seg>
<seg id="29">They must be fully treated so that they can overcome and look to the future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America, international bodies to call if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In relation to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he gave that he sees this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very hard."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa assured that, if he losing the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from the political life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">power has never interested me personally, but under unjust circumstances such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement had the belief that I was there, the likely victory guaranteed, so I must accept this responsibility," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I draw me from public life back.</seg>
<seg id="36">This also applies, if we lose.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is decided," he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also took to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba relation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I have just spoken with the Vice-President of Venezuela, nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he planned for a routine treatment would have travelled there, and that is that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It is in any case a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The Ecuadorian leader took part today in Lima on the 6th summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to provide for a sustainable progress, equality, and security.</seg>

<seg id="1">cause of a die due to AIDS is now a late detection</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the untersuchungsergebnis confirmed: HIV positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if a bomb struck," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success "abzuschwächen tried."</seg>
<seg id="4">He hid it in his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to care just about his illness and started to be informed, and this with such use, that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the hiv-einheit hospital civil de Guadalajara (hcg), in which he came after several fighting in 1994.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio lives with the humane immundefizienz-virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then it avoided even the director of a clinic of imss to adopt," because it led to a dead end."</seg>
<seg id="9">At that time, AIDS synonym for death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today, it is possible to this syndrome with quality of life to survive.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, there are still many people in the clinic, which know nothing of their disease and where the virus has already has harmed and exhausted their immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, that is the date of the first reported cases," the great success today, means that the survival of patients, the treatment starts on time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the hiv-einheit of hcg, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">An expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 schlussfolgerten that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life by the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the start of treatment depended, and that those would have greater opportunities that are not drogenabhängig: up to 30 years in a census of 200 cd4 and 50 years for a census of 500 cd4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, mean that the above speech, who at the age of 25 years the diagnosis hiv-positiv gets "can easily be 75 years old, in this sense, as long as it is under control," said the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to view this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today an average of 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report), it is still true that reduced the Onusida) Since the release of the AIDS 60 percent of the patients died entered into the national database.</seg>
<seg id="17">alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the month of May this year there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that it since 2005 have universal access to anti-retroviral drugs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- Why so people still die from it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- in my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the past 12 years we have had no versorgungsprobleme in the drugs. The problem is that the people in far advanced state come because you do not know your infektionszustand, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He makes a resounding statement: "nine out of ten patients have come to us if you already have an accompanying infektion. earlier diagnoses are needed in order to influence the global mortality, which is why all people, where this is necessary, massive screening tests should be offered."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This proposal are the experts and officials of the consejo habilidad de prevención del Sida en Jalisco (coesida) (state Committee to aids-vermeidung in Jalisco) and Fabrizio patients how to carry out the test at a private laboratory ließ, for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already was in the aids-phase and even the kaposi's sarcoma (had a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything is different, when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and don't want to hear.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I have to die, then to burst," says three times in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was to improve, I ernähre me well, practise sport and take the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today his parents only know that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, go much, have an active, but responsible sexleben, I am on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio count on the agreed to share his intimate details with milenio Jalisco, in his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global aids-tages fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">They should make the test, if you belong to the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, you should learn how to like all people can live responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="32">His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has taken up the cause of HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the most important thing is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In this particular locations "was actually increased the distribution of condoms; previously they were individually made, now give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">risikopersonen for new infections include the young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Why do you need?" is a common spottfrage, orientierungspersonal in schools, employees in pharmacies and by social workers in the health care system, the young people don't want to suspend, assured the correspondent.</seg>
<seg id="39">He proposed to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but are in ausgabegeräten in public toilets of facilities, which are often visited by young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not be promoting promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">They should not be paid the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González in response to the question, whether under his administration präservative would be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="42">"sexuality is not; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.</seg>

<seg id="12">There were many erfüllende years, including the five championships succedingly from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye to with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome mincy bsn.</seg>
<seg id="14">From then," cuco "ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that my genes bartow, here as a trainer, and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want to it? "</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.</seg>
<seg id="18">bartow recommended after the freiwurfspezialisten Raymond gausse, einbürgern ließ and one of our best werfer was.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember, as he said that, if mincy had a championship for bayamon allows gausse would provide a further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship the vaqueros with gausse was granted him, but even from a distance out, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="21">At that time he moved it to its application and to enjoy the mincy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when we won for the first time the upcoming tournament in Mexico against the United States.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then there was the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee would have been repeated, the recent US move for the second time, Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best national team, that you've ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is one of the best, as well as those in the 2004 Olympics against the dream team won.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favourite is the team of panamerikanischen games in Cuba, where we won gold in 1991 and the team offered a fight to the United States, as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the team were not only mincy gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "piculín" (ortiz) again here, but also the young players (Javier) "toñito" colón and James Carter, León (brothers Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, the 1990 due to a knieverletzung could not be there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team, which perhaps was not the best in terms of personalities, but we won a gold medal and the US, was the great joy of the upcoming tournament in 1995 neuquén, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players such as "canito" Nieves, Pablo alicea and the young Rolando hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events in the panamerikanischen play in Mar del Plata, we gained entgegen every prognose the gold medal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player from Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This was without doubt piculín ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level so as piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this, without taking account of his career in the various leagues, in which he has played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have had a number of good coach as Julio toro, flor meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of the young I like the work of Leo arill well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the bsn at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season included.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What will you still to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">That the guys in ponce, for example only play in your area and only in the national playoffs meet with teams from other corners of the island.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today the children unnecessary many travel and games.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least, I see the result of compulsory training and courses for trainer, tisch-offizielle and referee.</seg>
<seg id="46">I am proud of that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I listen to music, see videos of music my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and now and I can go to a basketballspiel.</seg>
<seg id="49">And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.</seg>
