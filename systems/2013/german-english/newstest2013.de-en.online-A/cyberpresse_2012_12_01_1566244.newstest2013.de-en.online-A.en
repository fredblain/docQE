Analyze the Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has attracted a certain prestige on last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson at nothing less than to the mechanism is involved, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And after all, it is the last particles, the existence of which from the standard model - predicted our best or "the least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - was still not observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson is predicted by the standard model.
In addition this seems new data to be confirmed, which were presented this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto, but lacks data to be completely secure.
We off that it is actually the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk, to deceive, however and we look to what it's about.
There is a necessarily inevitable law that provides that two objects can not be present at the same place in this world.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and not too try it because you are hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really weird world, turns out, that also a such law applies to them: the Pauli'sche exclusion principle, which States that two particles can occupy the same room at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state" with this "condition" on the whole, consisting of some of their properties.
Assuming physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are good citizens who are referred to as Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle good.
And move in the other bosons, an evil gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - definitely not this principle, which means that they are in fact located at the same time in the same place.
These bosons are divided according to the Web site of the particle adventure by the Berkeley laboratories (which is by the way absolutely amazing) in two groups: the Mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "force particle" by the spread of the great forces of nature and that the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be here but stresses that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this Chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "photon", which is the "Messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If indeed a particle with an electric charge speeds up or changes the direction, is the electromagnetic field exactly at this place "disturbed", roughly like a pebble which has been thrown into a pond.
An electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet (UV) radiation, etc.) resulting in this "disorder", and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of bosons "Carriers of the force".
Stable field
The same applies for the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that another field, the Higgs field "must be disturbed", so is this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much stronger than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies a bit similar to a frozen pond, which surface could be furrowed by a huge rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerators like CERN is necessary - the large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! -in order to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
There are in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never by itself keep the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the other (such as by the way the photon) have no mass.
What can all this research now for "be good", asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to examine all discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are Moreover many physicists who ardently hope that such deviations are found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter has major shortcomings, as it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, representing approximately 80% of the matter in the universe (again ups!).
However, such differences were not found at CERN until now.
Impact
The implications of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 1960s the pioneers of the laser at the Bell Laboratories have not assumed that their work would trigger such revolution.
They saw further scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has been working in the Bell Labs invented us in which the laser in the 1960s was, and 1962 itself the first time line laser (the first were pulsed) developed - said already, that the laser at the beginning rather than a "laboratory"gimmick was seen.
Introduce themselves...
In addition, applications may arise also from all the instruments, surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle has developed again in 1969 a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, serves this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as "Eye", and has brought a 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really never know it...
