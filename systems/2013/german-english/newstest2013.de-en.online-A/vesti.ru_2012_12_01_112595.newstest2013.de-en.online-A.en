Birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth dwellers on board are on the search for a substitute planet.
To save the mankind, is the important question of how we us can breed in space or on the spare planet?
There is not many choices in my opinion.
De facto, there are only two real planets we might inhabit at least hypothetically.
The scientific staff of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Wladimir Surdin says ", namely Mars and Venus".
While the conditions on Mars comparatively are enjoyable, however, a temperature of 500 degrees is on the surface of Venus.
Life would be possible only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, at all.
The researchers treated the question of reproduction in space first in terms of the flora.
Already half a century earlier experiments with plants were performed.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit differed not at all of the terrestrial species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), into the orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It developed into a normal chick.
But then the trouble begins.
The problem "is that the chicks must find support It must can stand on its feet and begin to move,"explains the head of laboratory of the Institute of medical biological problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without solid base the chicks fought over wild.
Ten hours later the instincts of newborn blunting completely.
The chicks responded not to light and sounds.
Four days later she died then.
"Twice we let slip chick and then set the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Wladimir Sychew maintains the failed experiment with the chick at all.
The last Brutk√§fig with animals flew in orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments are continued in the spring of 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be located on the Biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were sent already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found here.
"That was just with the Biosatellite, but it was again just a single experiment, and the research must be continued," Wladimir Sychew noticed.
After landing, the space rats got young.
So far, it could not solve the problem of reproduction in space.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat, can not just follow their Fortpflanzungstrieb.
Unlike animals humans might be in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not performed.
However, women fly for 50 years in space.
The greatest risk occurred with Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that has humanity, is the female organism.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one would have to answer the following question on Earth: it survives the spaceflight?
She can bring a child after this flight to the world?
"Eventually, no one answered this question", says space veteran Vahtang Watschnadse.
The first female Cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter gave birth to in June 1964, only a year after their spaceflight.
The father of the child, ANDRIAN Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who twice was in orbit and performed even working outside the spacecraft, a son gave birth to.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts after long flights, everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more it is more dangerous even for flights into orbit", concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must search for new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro laboratory at the Cosmonaut preparation Centre is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a State of limbo, the cosmonauts win routine for working in open space.
The water provides weightlessness.
Even though adults find water, it's a foreign environment; However, infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyander would drop testimony that life on the land emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months is in the mother's womb in the amniotic fluid, and that it can adapt more easily to water.
In principle, this makes sense, because from birth up to the first swim just take 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, the weightlessness that is a much more natural condition, the woman without gravity comes out.
In a State of weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles regresses very rapidly and thus decreases the ability to squeeze out the child.
Oh well, we bypass that by birth-introductory resource.
The birth could occur for example in a Special Chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?", is the not insignificant matter of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child needs also artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravity of Earth, the organism can not make out the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child can be placed in orbit not as an adult for training in a pollution suit.
That is simply missing him is for his life of fundamental importance.
The head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of medical biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow, "This experiment that we make together, namely the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead, we will bring a disabled, a completely non-aligned people to the world" predicts.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point it becomes reality but when break Earth dwellers on their ships to a distant planet, which is the home for their descendants born in space.
