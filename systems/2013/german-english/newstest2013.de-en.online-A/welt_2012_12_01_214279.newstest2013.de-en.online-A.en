The word "Human" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep split in the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia law as the basis is controversial.
The Egyptian President is not saved with pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he can succeed is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, above all but probably the Christian Copts, the Liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because they all have hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologetically, that temporarily curtailed powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its agenda "in order to save the revolution".
But what the 61 year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save it, the Egyptians, are is the world not completely in the clear.
Should the judiciary be overthrown?
Actually, the 234 articles are worrying that the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly, because in a nightly, 15 hour ride were rushed through some concern.
As in previous constitutions even stated in the draft, why the case law on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does it mean "Principles"?
This was and is the interpretation and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
At least a newly added guided article suggests that: in all matters concerning the Sharia Al Azhar University must be manual, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great charisma in the entire Sunni Islam.
This must not be, but it may mean that the clergy will supervise legislation what would de facto have the disenfranchisement of the judiciary resulted.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should be further maintained.
These dishes were used during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in Arrestbetweenapril.
The State should also, as it stands in the draft "the true essence of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morality and their values".
This is formulated legal point of view, so blurred that State institutions with the help of this article could control even the contents of film art and literature.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
There is no article by the way expressly establishes equality between men and women.
For another prohibits insulting the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers or slander.
But what is an insult and how she should be punished, remains unclear.
Also dubious is the formulation, "Insulting people" is prohibited.
Is there already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a leader?
Interpretation, like so much in the draft, which exists in Morsi for signature and according to him "very soon" will be presented the Egyptians to the referendum.
"The revolution has come back"
The opposition is forming for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday evening on Tahrir square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Leanne Sabbahi, 3rd place finisher of the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft Constitution belong "on the rubbish of history".
Via short message service Twitter he accused morsi's followers to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will to his palace go and overthrow him", said the opposition Jasser said.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brethren is not yet atoned", the Egyptian media have quoted the opposition leader Chaled Ali.
And several justices announced not to want to monitor the referendum, which it would be invalid.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to the counter-demonstration, just in case but not on Tahrir square, but after a mass prayer on the opposite bank of the Nile at the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists participated in and shouted: "The people demands the application of God's law."
They demanded by Mursi: "Clean the country!" and promised: "The Quran is our Constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the emblematic Tahrir square, where everything began, would have conjured up probably civil war conditions.
Morsi's followers wanted to do not risk quite obviously.
The Muslim Brotherhood said proponents as well as opponents of the draft had expressed loud and clear.
Now is the time to decide the people at the ballot box in what direction the country should go.
A majority shall be considered safe for the design of the Islamists.
"The word not even comes before human rights"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which actually would have until February to go and involve all social forces.
The 48 year old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood as they sat under Mubarak in prison or were before the Court.
Not because he'd share their worldview, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For he was beaten up, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he complained in an interview with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi power Ausweitung were on all three branches in the State to be resigned to the lawyer.
These actions are flagrant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President put them de facto override", Saeda complained.
However, a democracy could not function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which considered the ideological direction of struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
That could take revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "you geb√§hrt a monster that you can no longer control."
