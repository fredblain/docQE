"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While members of Parliament and civil rights activist in discussing, what benefits it brings the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals Act already with fake certificates
Every year come 13 million migrant workers to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the upkeep of the families remaining in the home.
On December 1, an Act entered into force which according to each migrant must take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, the municipal housing sector and retail.
However, the tests with time according to Federal Migration Office should be in future for all migrant workers mandatory.
Here you must play not only language tests but also tests in Russia's history and the basics of the legislation.
Language skills must be assigned to both the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also, people who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991 are exempt from this law.
Meaning, problems and protection of the rights
The whole of the examination bodies is the Russian University of people's friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities are under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of Russian, language.
The migrants can take the tests in all the cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres were opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal migration service.
Civil libertarians, however, was before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: what actually brings the whole thing?
What changes is the requirement to have language skills, both for the Russians and for the migrant workers?
First of all, say the migration authority spokesman, matter it to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many now speak about the protection of the rights of migrant workers", says the head of the representation of the federal migration service in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected prior to their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers 90%.
Migrants encounter problems without professional, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future immigrants without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who stuck him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will hold out for months without food, and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day toiling with dozens peer to peer.
Many complaints by our migrants reach us.
"One is promised you in the home, and upon arrival you are scammed, get off their passports and receive not the promised reward," the Chief confirmed Head Office for labour migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not ranting, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics that want to make their money in Russia, to say that they can not control not only the language of the destination country, but hardly writing expressing themselves in their own language.
Of course thats not so much their fault, as rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only a sound basic education.
Because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone, them to buy decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children then immediately take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language", they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activist stress following important aspect with regard to the law.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
You do not have this status there is no check and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile the bulk of migrant workers is still illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access for unauthorized persons prohibited"
Many migrants to confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
Bureaucratic hurdles and of course the language difficulties are the reason.
Also, the legalization costs money: 12 16 thousand rubles up to.
You can make a fake registration quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents largely falsified and we not registered are, and from it arise cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for buying cigarettes and tea," expresses the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Only spare no costs for false papers"
Already on the day on which the Act came into force, turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be faked.
Some fake certificates, which certify the completion of the language tests were taken by employees of the Federal Migration Service fitting.
The fake documents were printed with a normal colour printer.
Of course the new owners received it not in vain: every migrant, who hoped to be able to save yourself so the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs three thousand rubles a migrant workers.
Moreover, that is the most important immediate task is to protect the system so that the certificates can be bought not just against corruption both officials and civil libertarians agree.
For the moment the authorities can migrant worker remittances, falling for the first time through the test, promise only that they get time for a language basic course.
In addition, authorities in areas are offered newcomers without language skills where no active communication with people is necessary.
