Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
Quebec discussed the sensitive issue of the Lebensendes recently with its Committee on "Dying with dignity".
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, it remains still much to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived still alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I got seven years," he said half heartedly in his bed at the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil lying where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it is always a shock, that you can be unprepared," he says.
The illness makes their work: an immense weakness prevents him from walking alone to the toilet and even to eat.
On the table in front of a delicious lunch sitting, he agrees resigned to help the food.
Brave manages even to smile him and talking to him are around, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath with strangers.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhea because it is humiliating," he tells.
A few hours later, the team has found a remedy for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that pisses a man standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"That depends on the ability of the person", take a step backwards, he noted.
Because according to more than one person working in palliative care, major events in the midst of this backsliding.
The patients, who are assigned to the home for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois, suffer all of cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them, with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., the worst fear, "deliberately and suffocation" to die is 89 years.
But due to the illness I got to know my children really.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have nothing more in life," she says before she will accept that to set up a mask you, that helps her breathe.
Guests still have a last visit her son, who came from Italy in the next few days.
At the home of Victor-Gadbois, it provides personal care and assistance with food intake with a group of volunteers.
The palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make the dying.
In Quebec, a bed for the palliative care comes to 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little if we consider the fact that one day we all will die.
Here, life under optimum conditions will continue, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
They have an oral care with brandy or Pepsi the dying according to your wishes.
Diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we have served a beer Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help care professionals and patients alike," reported care Director Nathalie Savard.
There is no tag like the other in the home of Victor-Gadbois.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, which enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and is supported well by his pillow while one encounters in his honor, died a young man for 36 years, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years are occupied", Dr. Christiane Martel tells worried.
53% of the patients hospitalized in the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their abode, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have access to palliative care, i.e. to a treatment that will relieve the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the society for palliative care in the greater Montreal more or less exclusively specialize in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this major shortcoming in Quebec health care ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto circulating signed mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe of prominent figures of palliative care as Dr. Balfour, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel according to the Quebec health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that all have right to a high-quality palliative care before it is accepted to go to the euthanasia.
More recently, says I have seen it, a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room was, without that it has adopted measures for their relief.
I fear that the patients want to die just because they receive no proper health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst forecasts doggedly until the last day.
The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, she broke off an arduous chemotherapy.
As I've told my oncologist that I'll stop treatment, she has replied me that she regret the fact that I have to give up the fight, she told.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nurses that there has not been held this request after their pain by a team of palliative care have been alleviated.
But clearly, it must be said that the palliative care in treating pain is not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, Director of the palliative care of society of home palliative care of Metropolitan Montreal, attract 8% of patients not on pain treatment.
At the end of life the doctors access often terminal sedation, which boils down to the patient either intermittently or permanently up to the time of his death to euthanize.
We can not do as if we do not perceive this page of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the ability to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose Schmerzen not be relieved, all say same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want that you euthanize me", but "I want that my pain".
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism fellowship Canadian Institute of health research.
