Messenger: NASA discovered ice on mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is Mercury ice on the planet.
The ice should be may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there are also there frozen water as three on Thursday in the journal "Science" published studies.
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is a sheet of ice in the permanently in the shadow region of the planet.
This should at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water came probably comets or possibly asteroids that are bashed on mercury.
Nobody put the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the Chief Scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to clarify how got water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the corresponding probes, telescopes, and small robots such as Phoenix are to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time send images to Earth: small peepholes into infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera that have developed German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, orbiting the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is according to the new definition of the terms of the International Astronomical Union from 2006 no "planet".
This image of an infrared recording the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of Star: the oldest stars are as blue points to recognize are the pink "newborn" in the star circle Hall harder to identify.
This star-forming region - by scientists unromantic W5 called - the telescope has discovered Spitzer in the star image of Cassiopeia 6500 light-years away.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has recorded the Spitzer telescope of the NASA.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star in the dying process hurled out.
Located in the enormous Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new star arise from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of the NASA shot this photo of the Galactic birth room.
Called the Pleiades star cluster, "The seven sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, the colors come however better to the best advantage.
Such as a red, the Helix Nebula in this infrared photograph looks ahead to the Viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent brought the title of North America in this fog.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides the spectacular colours.
This baby star could only be resumed by the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors in its full beauty.
Saturn and its rings: How these have arisen, is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and hottest shots of the Hubble Telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colour images of spiral galaxies are true works of art.
The photo published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light-years distant in the constellation Sagittarius Trifid Nebula.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three parts, three Spalten), as dark dust strips instance the glowing heart of the birthplace of stars.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic Carom: 400 million light-years away rush the nuclei of two merging galaxies together to and are inevitably are colliding.
The birth of these stars was the Hubble space telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who are not technical abbreviations, which may call them at her nickname southern wheel of fire.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the IRIS Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The 1400 light years away fog consists of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images from different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away.
This group of galaxies, ARP 273 called the space telescope Hubble for NASA is recorded.
Scientists UGC 1810 call the larger spiral galaxy.
In this Nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way Galaxy.
The stern cradle produces new youngster.
Also these stars cloud brings forth new baby star combined with the Rosette Nebula, - 5000 light-years away.
Still no dust, but rather only gas exists in this bright shining Galaxy with a small black hole.
Researchers suspect that he was born shortly after the big bang, was mainly hydrogen to be found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The main telescopes
The telescope should be - invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey even before Galileo Galilei one year later used it to star gazing.
Since then the mirrors of optical telescopes have been getting bigger - and the insights which they deliver deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world was.
The mirror in the picture, had an average of five meters.
There is the large binocular telescope in Arizona, United States.
It looks into space equal to two mirror admits, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge – alone of the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African large telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reached a diameter of 11 meters.
Disadvantage of reasonable construction: the telescope is lashed in his elevation - and limited in his mobility.
Also the hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in elevation.
Its special feature: the high light gathering power.
This is namely - despite relatively small mirror diameter — to the world's largest telescopes.
Researchers monitor space for alien signals using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
The telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Every computer owner can help with the "search for extraterrestrial intelligence" (SETI), providing computing power available.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
It says here that the very large telescope - which lives up to its name.
The telescope can illuminate the middle infrared spectrum with its four mirrors.
The European extremely large telescope is scheduled also on the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror to include whopping 42 metres - and used from approximately 1000 mirror elements together.
With images, but no earlier than 2018 is expected.
Until 2007 the two Keck Telescopes on a Hawaiian Volcano Mauna Kea is considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer two levels with each an average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which can look next to them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an illustration to marvel at.
The Hubble Space Telescope provides the main impressions from the space however.
Since April 24, 1990, it provides images of distant worlds already.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler searches for extrasolar planets – mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011 was announced by NASA, 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the final preparations to the space telescope Kepler are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot on board an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The space infrared telescope primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: to light from the first stars and galaxies after the big bang look.
Scientists assume that ice exists at the South Pole of mercury.
However there is no reliable data, because the Messenger at the North Pole far closer orbit around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on mercury for decades.
Through the 2004 launched Messenger probe - the first, which revolves around the mercury, scientists now have certainty.
