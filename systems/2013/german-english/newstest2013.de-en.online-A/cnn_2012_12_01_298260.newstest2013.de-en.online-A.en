My Mexican-American identity.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of missing opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans between two worlds are trapped
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had only just crossed the Hall and had arrived at the passport control when helplessness in me was wide.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds long, uncertain of which I myself should go.
I grew up in Central California and "Mexicans" was called all my life.
Exactly how, my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians" call an ethnic symbol.
Later, I decided to "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just plain Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to hold me in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going off also my American accent.
So, I took my American passport and introduced me to the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment of this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
All those issues are expected to meet the heads of these two countries were on the agenda: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans remain nowadays as likely in Mexico, rather than to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modeled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, although he named no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasting a single thought that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico, and this forced the leadership of the country holding out gun to leave more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
If so, a US Government official has even the mildest criticism of Mexico, one - stops in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how Americans urge the sovereignty of its neighbour.
And the children of Montezuma embark on the warpath.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico's truth in the relationship lies with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans, who live in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for the opportunities the country, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio living, is that at one point in our family tree, one person, maybe offered got a parent or grandparent - no chance in Mexico and emigrated to the North.
And in most cases this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty applies them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, visited good schools and good jobs will have we must never lose sight, that it is the American dream, we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurry sometimes perhaps, but as regards our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a Memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish is never well be enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families not in Mexico would have failed, they would not have.
And then we would not see us now caught behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but yet somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child, immigrated legally to the United States, reminded me that Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions between, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican-Americans resent this them.
While it is a United States citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling to belong neither to the one nor to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but in none of them rooted.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated want to resume ties with the diaspora.
You want to use Mexican Americans provisional 'Ambassador' for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about it, how great is a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leaders, to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country in the face of the unjust distribution of income, unbridled corruption, and the drug-related violence.
I'm afraid, because you need to through alone, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico, one and a half centuries ago they must also accept that some Mexican Americans cherish a grudge that their family members were treated until not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "Mexican" than I thought.
