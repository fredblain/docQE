In a continuously electrified world, it's nice to be sometimes bored
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours at the airport, as was our aircraft due to mechanical problems and we had to wait on a different plane.
So, I had enough time to make me a few thoughts to boredom.
I will not lie.
Half a day at the airport one to wait for flight is pretty annoying - even, if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's for us and our children - okay, being occasionally bored.
Thus the brain is forced to lose, interesting thoughts which might enhance the creativity.
And because most of us these days almost always stare at the one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom won't benefit us.
Should we therefore welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
Sure I come back again.
How many people even I am always assumed, that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "boredom: A lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) which does not appear.
"Actually the boredom has a very long history," he says.
A Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century decorates the walls of Pompeii.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada according to is the problem is that boredom in many ways has been defined and discussed.
After long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as the experience can be define "to engage in any satisfying activity, but not to this".
Boredom differs from apathy as a result so that the person is not employed, but wants to be.
At the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of attention, coupled with bad mood and feel that time passes slowly".
Boredom can be heard almost as it as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that while these two States in context may be, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that is boring us, even if we just have trouble concentrating.
In their study "the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention" – to German as: "the idle mind: the definition of boredom from the point of view of attention", in September in the journal "Perspectives on psychological science" was published, wise Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment and the operator a tape listened to where a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring room, that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group at all not heard these noises.
Those who heard the barely audible television, say they feel more boredom than the two other groups - they had trouble concentrating, could find no reason for this and wrote to their difficulties of boredom.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or arduous task the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If however, a monotonous activity carried out - "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help to feel not bored".
In fact, he says we now know that foraging dithers and doodling, often as a sign of boredom interpreted, even can combat this by people remain physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are jumping around, learn more and retain more information than those forced to sit still are," as Professor Fenske.
All of us will ever get bored - my delayed flight, a booming speakers, a particularly tedious film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale to the vulnerability of boredom" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements offers such as "Many things that I have to do repeat themselves and are monotone" and "I have so many interests that I have not enough time for everything".
Using these scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of psychology at the University of West Florida-, particularly the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But, in General, teenagers are a pretty tight bunch.
Reed Larson, Professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, introduced in 1991 by experiment, where he seven to eight times contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents on the day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and while doing the homework were bored, while 23% indicated to be bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents stated to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom are increased or decreased.
He was however sure that "the youth as a particularly boring perceived", mainly because children and teenagers have no influence on their daily flow.
So back to my original question: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes that people take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs, to relieve it – studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers explore the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom the brain wants to tell, that you should do something else", as Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what to do just the best.
When is a boring and to use this energy to play guitar and to Cook, you will be happy.
But television can provide in the short term, while feelings of happiness, they evaporate in the long term but again.
Who extends his bored child so an iPad, can bring down certainly from the boredom. It has not learned that but to entertain themselves or control, Professor Fenske said.
And he adds: "Self-control spreads of a situation to the other".
The child learns not only to entertain, but receives more self-regulation in other areas.
I don't think that we should celebrate boredom.
We should not be too critical see it also.
Instead, our aim should consist, also away from the constant activity and technology drip irrigation to feel us.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds so than needs to be more boring to us. But boredom is excruciating, unrelenting desire to do something useful,"he says.
He believes that people in fact are looking only for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment where we constantly over are stimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is silenced once."
