Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are being attacked for their views
Has always been greatest dream was my to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the University, I once considered to be the largest temple of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek Symposium, which encouraged the great pillars of civilization--freedom of thought and tolerance--.
But two weeks after my entry into the Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought to the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The evening standard stated that I would be gone, because I would have had a problem with it, that fellow students in the adjacent room had sex.
The author of A N Wilson mischievously said I could leave the University because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not due to my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
You had me just for a reason harassed - one reason seemed so parochial and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key Adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I advocate of the conservative party.
Why I mention this right now?
Now, according to latest reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right suffers from similar prosecution.
Organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has developed now such dimensions that a bunch of them last week demanded the same equal protection benefit gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Specify the conservative members of the junior common room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College, they will be on the basis of their political views "often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared undesirable".
Request a seat on the equal opportunities Committee of College, to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was made worse by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC two, "Wonderland: young, bright, and on the right", portraying the Tories as an eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It was among other graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove a Rolls-Royce and showed off silver-coloured suit with silver-covered walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as "Scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year old Luke black, Vice President of the conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, he said in a Sunday newspaper: "there is a growing trend of link at universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club, without ever having met us".
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year old Stephanie Cherill, designated President of the conservative Student Association of Oxford says she have observed a growing aversion to students of the moderate right in JCR members.
"This represents a danger for intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members", she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford I was such a minority.
As incredibly shy 18 year old, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its peak.
Last year, the University that had voted Margaret Thatcher - a previous student, to give no honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have put even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first week, where new students meet up and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but participated even with joy.
Political issues such as the miners strike, privatization, and the rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa's Government found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
My first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century in English. What then should come, I had been unmounted.
"Miss Wyatt", the tutor of Harry Pitt (now deceased), said "contact over the first paragraph".
I stumbled here.
Pitt was a small man with a face like from cake mix, and quite spiteful.
"Refuse Thatcher supporter, to learn French, or are they just stupid?", he asked.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes, tears manage to.
"I suggest that they take some French lessons in your spare time - so, if you are not too busy with your social activities", Pitt growled at me.
Hanging his head, I returned to my room.
This evening, I sat in college alone at dinner, when somebody lightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from a sophomore named James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is harassed.
For me, it's bad enough, but they know that your father of Margaret Thatcher is close, so it will be worse for you.
The most Tory students pretending to be supporters of the labour party.
At a local pub, I tried later to dissemble.
I insisted that I was not in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher of agrees.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who as a conservative force Eton College had visited, said that ironically to me: 'you're the daughter of a fascist pig'.
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How Tories have sex?" one asked me.
That fight each other, or?
I felt so as homosexuals before the more liberal legislation of the United States had to have felt.
Would succeed depending on me to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
I can meet only like-minded people after dark?
Should I need to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years, which lay in front of me, expanded my mind's eye to a purgatory of exclusion and isolation.
The only tutor who did open as a Tory, was Norman Stone, Professor of contemporary history, which had its seat in my college.
He was not only hated being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him parochial and small-minded, and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic history perspective.
in 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will be not happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents House and took refuge with open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me, that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
They would never do such a thing not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends were always impeccable manners on the day.
Himself tarnished his moist eyes.
Give a chance to the whole.
I'm sure you only teases you.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London my emotional resistance grew weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporter, had yielded to the pressure and renounce his beliefs.
While a tutorial in the following week, in which a further history tutor seriously maintained, I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging with shame, I admitted that I had submitted to my parents "Brainwashed", and named it "old sucker".
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press per week.
My door was locked.
I was hiding in my room, and my captors gave up after five minutes.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Like you can call me a whiny wimp.
But no 18-year-old should have to suffer ever school such intimidation and wickedness.
And even more tragic is that it was a University, Oxford â€“ not produced only 14 Tory Prime Minister, but hiding today behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
