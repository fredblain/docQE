In the United States, fast-food and supermarket workers go on strike
Every fourth American young people at some point sits behind the entrance of MC Donald's
In the last few days there was's, Burger King, Taco Bell, in the United States for massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains like Mc Donald a Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests will further swell or whether them soon again the air runs out.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations.
In addition to improving the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is not unionized.
46 Cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, when in the United States sales took place, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes resulted in melee.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are worldwide 2.2 million, laid down their work and bestreikten branches of the chain, targeting people of low and moderate income together with trade unions and left-wing activists.
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores on average between 8 and 27% is cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore many of the slightly paid Walmart employees only at own work shop.
Walmart made one of the largest companies in the United States the prices and the assortment of goods.
Critics say Walmart can sell often only therefore as cheap goods because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter complain about severe working conditions, such as missing fork or hand scanner.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about that contribution for the in-house health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars was increased in the month.
A typical Walmart employee who is the hour earned 9.5 US dollars, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company the hour increased the average wage to 12 dollars, 3.2 billion dollars would cost Walmart.
These are approx. 1.1% more than they now spend for wage.
Would Walmart have to assess wage increases completely on the customer, any purchase cost them in the future only 46 cents more.
Per year would be for them compared to today spending increases of only 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart happy determine that protests occurred only in nine States and this brought the company any loss.
The Black Friday until the next day in his shop by 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday midnight, and during this period, Walmart sold approximately 5000 article per second.
Overall, the Walmart cashier on "Black Friday" led almost 100 million transactions.
Spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post, that "less than five" Walmart employee laid down the work and the protest had been merely 'another PR trick"of the Trade Union, which organized the protests,.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where however not Walmart stores (which are not desirable and therefore so far non-existent in this progressive city), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants were their objective.
McDonald's says the company sell billion servings, but it gives you no sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Legislation is currently York the minimum wage under federal and new at 7.25 dollars hour.
Gradually, the minimum wage is however not too strongly, lifted in fast-food restaurants, and average their simple employees in New York City, 8.90 US dollars get the hour.
Less than she deserves nobody in this expensive city.
It is incomprehensible to me how it is possible to come into New York with so little money.
There was a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American young people stood after school behind the counter at McDonald's, but the young people lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of income in or planned to stay longer.
Now people who complain that they come out with this wage must feed sometimes even their children meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly.
On the other hand, there is in the Forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal comment, whose Verfasser notes that it was irresponsible to have children, if you did not know how it is to feed them.
The participants of the protests called for on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began that the cashiers and cooks the hour get a minimum wage of $ 15 by fast-food restaurants, more than a doubling of the current minimum wage is equivalent to.
They also demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The American law prohibits corporate governance to this objective in the way and to urge Union members or dismissed.
On the other hand the management makes it not easy them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is difficult but also for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day well before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The height of the protests was a gathering at noon before the McDonald's in times square, where some local Democrats said, including City Council Member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billion servings, but it gives you no sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also from other prominent New York Democrats supported mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said, for example, that "we should jointly the fast-food employee support, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, deserves every New Yorker!".
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people, of which by far not all in the fast-food industry are engaged, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
Still is not clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
