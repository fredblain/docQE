Old battles, new Middle East
The truce between Israel and Hamas could prove to be unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there be ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such a hope in the bud.
Countless buildings reduced to rubble were laid in the midst of the usual finger-pointing, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza close to the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem are bashed.
But although Israelis and Palestinians appear trapped in their historic conflict, he changed Middle East around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this confusion.
Maybe this will lead only to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff might finally find its end.
A war, which is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism in the face of the current situation seems anything but appropriate.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the this week's fighting have strengthened the hard-nosed on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although his grouping had to record large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and crammed the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the resounds and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet, has not succeeded Israel so far, to destroy Hamas.
Actually gains the Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
So, as Islamists have increased their influence in the Arab world, Hamas has can draw rich and powerful friends on your site.
Turkey, a back-country, regional power, once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken party one of the richest and most dynamic Golf States for Hamas - just like Qatar.
Cheering Hamas supporters to believe that to Israel an Islamic Crescent forms - from the Lebanon in the North, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels of increasingly islamistischeren embossed Bashar Assad's could stand before the support to back to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the King.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - changed the balance of the region the by far the highest population and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel's persistent.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot 2011 30 years ruled Egypt until his overthrow, had left little time for Hamas.
In contrast to this, the brotherhood with the Hamas is related by marriage and their leaders more of people views depend on.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could be as an actor, which not can excluded itself from Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, however, can draw an opposite conclusion.
Hamas is no threat militarily seen.
The Israeli missile defense system, "iron dome", has to prove himself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least awhile long Israel can sleep quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States adhere steadfastly to their position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest Gewalteskalationen.
Fared well Israel in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a large extent.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed 30 Israelis since 2004, for example, is the country not least remained relatively free of suicide bombers – thanks to its locking facilities, the inside run in the West Bank and thus the bulk of an eventual Palestinian State. These protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared for illegal under international law, but always further expanded.
Netanyahu stands out as well. His Likud party has allied himself in the run-up to the elections on January 22 under Avigdor Lieberman with a still kämpferischeren group.
Left to their own state why coddle also these malevolent Palestinians and them?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, would they fire rockets also not exactly like their comrades in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall at Bay and punish them should they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard-liners can prevail. But the Arab spring could make them a stroke through the Bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in Egypt and in other countries in power, have left little for Israel, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab Governments barely repair their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi with Barack Obama teamed to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps to symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democracy, Palestinians are deprived continue their autonomy - a powder keg that undoubtedly to explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just like this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression undermines democracy in the Jewish State already, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to the repression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will take their diplomatic toll increasing over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is that which is represented by the wiser representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two States cede the areas where Israel for security purposes.
-Small for the near future – hope is that the cease-fire gives outsiders more influence to implement this solution.
Egypt must stop the supply of arms in the Gaza Strip have in common with Turkey and Qatar and is better positioned than ever before to Hamas by the idea of a Jewish State based on borders of 1967, complemented by land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem, to persuade.
Outside Arab Nations should move also Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
Thus, more for the creation of a Palestinian State would be done as with the upcoming request to UN observer status.
Obama also must help his part to move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he dismissed the idea of his own peace plan.
It seems far away in the White House, he would be averse to participation as well.
But that is an unfortunate and short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a substantial interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
