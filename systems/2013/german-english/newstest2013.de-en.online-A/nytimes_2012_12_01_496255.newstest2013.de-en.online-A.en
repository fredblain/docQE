In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19 year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorado for a misdemeanor in court, which will be soon legal in this State: the possession of some less chunks of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day in Lamar car close to the border with Kansas on the road, when they were arrested.
After the police had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was cited for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - offenses, each fitted with a penalty of $ 100 - and received a court date.
"We are treated as criminals", so Orozco.
But he is also one?
Depends on the answer to hundreds of minor drug offences, less by the law than by the location in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the State to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use.
Hundreds of offences that are turning to marijuana, are here and in the State of Washington approved the similar measures, already dropped.
Police no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law, as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts in Colorado have announced to continue existing marijuana offenses and quote are still people in court.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver, through to the Western mountains in vote to prevent new, state licensed marijuana shops opening in their communities.
"This situation evolves so quickly, that I don't know what will happen next", says Daniel j. Oates, Chief of police in Aurora, which lies east of Denver.
And even regulators in the State of Washington is clueless scratching their heads.
You are waiting for a guide to establishing a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a period until December 1, 2013 in mind.
In Washington, if one believes that Colorado is the most States ahead in any case, what concerns the regulation of marijuana. There was legalized the drug only for medical purposes and then to the own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The State is therefore suitable for the orientation", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for liquor stores in the State of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent, we can follow," he added.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and is also the terminus of a grey area, in which the State licensing system but does not exist, but the ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practice questions must be - clarified during this time such as the State standard of "reasonable access" to license marijuana with the prohibition shall be agreed cannabis shops within a radius of 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"Nowhere it will be more difficult, to find a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for legal cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent an E-Mail in which he said the Prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offenses for persons over the age of 21, his employees in Aurora and that the police "now" will seek no criminal charges for this offence.
Chief Oates added that the police will enforce continue to city specifications to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continues to pursue.
In Weld County in Northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote he said his agency would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly, to move consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently 119 persons for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana Court must answer, although many also for other crimes were indicted.
"Our agency has the duty to prosecute violations, which were criminal offences at the time", Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer displays adults for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided but also to do so, not to drop all pending possession proceedings.
"I don't think that I waste my time to enforce the right, until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear right from the outset that it would be not easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of Government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the State encouraged a profound dichotomy in regard to the large green days experiment among local officials.
When District Attorney was a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the accused for marijuana-related crimes in court and acts as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"You've spent such a large part of their lives to prosecute that they always still cannot accept the legalization for people", he believes.
As the first States that handle smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, dealt in Colorado and Washington as a national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and State officials prepare for an era of legal sales, waiting at the same time also nervous statements of the Federal Government, which will handle the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice is yielding.
Despite several spectacular arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama Government believes, that detective who will enter no doors probably to seize small amounts of drugs, are reluctant but most likely to tolerate the legal under the new law, Government-regulated marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait that the Federal Act.
Before election day, some local Governments approved moratoria on new marijuana operations, although this could open in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a town in the West, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
"We would not be in a position, in which we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level", so Bob Nicholson, Member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We focus then, for what the community has decided and not afterwards, the State has opted for what.
Many questions are still open.
