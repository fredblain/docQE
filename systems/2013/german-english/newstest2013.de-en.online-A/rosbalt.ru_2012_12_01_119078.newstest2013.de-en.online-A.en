Your own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", which is dedicated to urban dwellers who make up the vanguard of art and culture.
Already senior officials of St. Petersburg art scene, whose success go beyond the borders of the city, and which often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia landed on the fine list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, the Red-clad bearded, which can be found at the Russian Museum, times in the summer garden, times at scene-meeting or exhibitions.
Where the images are also issued by Kirill Miller, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and In the early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and puts a smile in the face of his fellow citizens through its presence on the street, and ensures a good mood for them.
Recently, he snapped a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg barrel organ player, because he felt finally ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist General, his philosophy and his image.
-Why are you Kirill, always red and not for example yellow or turquoise in the city on the road?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with optics and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between the artist and image consultant company.
Everything is different some of the grey standard, aggression and bad behavior causes in society.
But, I want to come through my provocations with the people in the conversation.
Each of my last provocation was an invitation to talk.
-When did you know that you need to become a painter?
-At an exhibition in the Palace of culture of Nevsky of my works were exhibited.
I realized that I have to go this way.
Then went to the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painter at that time to end, and new and free painter like me were incomprehensible.
I befriended me with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of "Gazonewschina"; This resulted in "Pushkinskaya-10", and then was once.
It draws me to the theatre, to fashion, to the music, actually everything except for the literature.
And all this combined is in your kind clinic... - it was important to stand, where the best creative artists should gather in the center of St. Petersburg culture.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical artistic Club for the Bohemian, the House of the Petersburg Bohemians to the renovation work.
Many were there born: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember also, as cord came with his project "Ucho Van Goga" there.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs to playback, wore tight uniforms and also the today featured composer Igor Wdowin belonged to them.
As the Group began to play, live her "Leningrad" was taken.
Trachtenberg hosted many programs ahead of time "Halli Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
The Gallery "D 137" or the Club "Griboedov" have their origin in the art clinic.
There went our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In the year 2000, there was a poll, which dealt with the award of "Personalities of our city" in the press.
I won in the category of "Artist of the year", and thus I had arrived at the peak.
It is not easy to work, according to old rules in new times I am a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without thus make a cultural contribution.
-Your works have a distinctive style.
-Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the freshness and sharpness of thought.
I am going to have an exhibition with the theme of "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was social, but now it hurts and is afraid to do so.
In a clown, blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
We can save for example the world by we prescribe that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now respects everyone on the clothes and focuses on the exterior and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps may be not the hand a person, but should it have to spit in the face.
The illusion disappears through the dressing.
-More recently, we saw you in the role of the municipal organ player. -A city of culture should have as a hero.
Who, if not I?
-Can and commercial art be beautiful?
-Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of civilizations.
Earlier, the people formed large groups: Bohemians loved the other one and the common people.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not one hundred dollar bill, which pleases everyone.
Now you need to think about you, you'll like who.
Now, every cult star has about 100 followers.
-Several thousand come to the performances by Stas Michailow but!
-Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand come, hence there is less management, money, and everything goes based.
I have followers, and the important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such pictures hung at a collector even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I began with images, which usually come at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It's called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, this is something completely different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture that I am in favour of.
-Petersburg Kirill, what's missing?
-Good culture experts.
It is said: servant of the culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
At the real Tsar, it was different, because the Czars understood much of culture perhaps, but they understood that right experts are needed.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In Petersburg, we have that the experts might be, but them is blocking the way, as it hochrangigerer experts who correctly evaluate the former and pave the way to them.
Now counts only the own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not all must accept contemporary art and some painters are looking so other museums.
-Petersburg what is for you?
-Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there are much more culture and an appropriate medium.
On our stones, art can grow difficult.
We need a cultural medium, because for example, we have now more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people, the exhibitions or attend concerts.
We are much less.
Art has to be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded from grants of the city of Saint Petersburg
