Bitcoin payments and sell without Bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and fees between the parties involved.
In addition, a political vision is tangible as so often in these technologies: the conviction that the current, crafted of Bank monopolies monetary system, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is a virtual currency (but in dollars, euro convertible, etc.) as well as a protocol for secure exchanges such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers, around 200,000 transactions were recorded in the network.
Several thousand Web pages accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin had reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later on dollars 2 before it has recovered today to around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the Web site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive when compared to the global trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest to do this in a report published in October on virtual currencies.
She describes as "the virtual currency with the greatest success" bit coin, "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "credits", which are used to move forward in a video game by playing win or buy (and sometimes also change back) can.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and edited every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositary of Rechnungsbuchs, examiner, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two E-Mail addresses in the form of an e-mail message.
With the only difference being that the user choose a different address for each payment can, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction related is electronically signed with a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
By using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that there are the traded Bitcoins in the invoice book common across the entire network of the public accounts.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers where the winner, which is a kind of interim central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a crushing of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file to a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
Add a number to it, before the whole "hacked" the computer "take" the new transaction
The goal is to find the number that results in a particular fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is right.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to tricking two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) wants to pay same money, only one of the two transactions from the network would be validated and the others will have no link, as have both different fingerprints.
The computer that initiated the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent an inflation this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The outstanding Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionstel divisible, allowing some leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task with each improvement of computing power is increased.
The life of the network had already ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The shared vulnerability affects not the actual Protocol", Pierre Noizat, has introduced just Paymium, which is a company to pay with real money and uses the network of Bitcoin is assured.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering by using this anonymous service.
However, cash also exhibit these defects.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse such donations.
Others such as the blog platform of WordPress they are accepted.
Recently Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir from the Weizmann Institute in Israel the invoice book analyzed and show that almost 80% of Bitcoins not in circulation.
A "mega sales" was launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, converted the Bitcoins in gold would be glad.
Pierre Noizat, who also is author of a book about this currency is a firm believer in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia is a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner maintains its identity and can remain so anonymous.
The system can be implemented easily with retailers, and the latter must install no new terminal or computer programs.
You must specify just an address that from a phone "can be photographed and recognized", specifies Pierre Noizat assured that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally-oriented systems are covered.
He predicted "it will take some time until Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point,".
The ECB provides incidentally in her report, to assess various, regarded today as a high risk in case of success of this currency.
