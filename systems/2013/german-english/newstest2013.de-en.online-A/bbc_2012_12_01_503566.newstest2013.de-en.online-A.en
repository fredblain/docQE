Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
You place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sports clothes.
And leave it there a week.
Something must the nose-numbing smell of Rakfisk imagine, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and these stubborn odor in the air that just won't go away.
Rakfisk is sprinkled trout that-, how smelly they would like to have his fish - up to a year in water is fermented depending on salt.
If in Norway comes the darkness over the land and the weather gets colder, stream Norwegians into a celebration here in Fagernes, this, now, really captivating specialty dedicated to is.
"You eat it raw and then rinsing it with a glass of aquavit down," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as so-called "Rakfisk-General" organizes the Festival.
Around us, people consume small fish cubes and to consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Number of people more than the Rakfisk like the aquavit", Harvard says.
The spirit can displace the odor.
I taste some snacks.
When to avoid bringing the Rakfisk close to the nose, he is not bad - like sushi, which has a quite a long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no cooling options and dipped in the autumn in airtight barrels of salt water fish.
In the depths of winter he was then taken out after long fermentation and eaten - no doubt see senses muffled by alcohol.
A generation ago, faced thousands of Norwegians in search of work forced to leave their country and emigrated mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants lured by a booming labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health service.
Immigrants flock from Sweden, the old rivals, which was far richer than Norway, not too long ago.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, smelling part of Norwegian history if also strict.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But here everything is expensive--a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euro.
Norway not often succeed in the world press, and which seems not to bother most people.
Here, one there still hates Anders Breivik on behalf to name a few - those racist right-wing extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident of July 22".
Norwegians do find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country such brutal killings is capable.
The growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries of the world is mainly responsible for the present wealth of Norway's since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why it goes so well us," says Anna, our waitress who distributed round trays with ripe Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are one - how do you - say prudent people.
Her English is just like that of most people here flawless.
We are not very pretentious, we like not an idle boast.
Norway is handled very carefully with its oil wealth--a large portion of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the great depression all money around threw, that they had not, Norway was firmly closed his wallet.
"As long as we can go skiing in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk", she adds with light-hearted laughter.
I stand in the snow and make me for another court - by Rakfisk, I've had enough.
As a Moose-Burger is something else anyway. The juicy meat tastes me.
But in the evening the Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel where I logon, is one of several venues, organizing a Rakfisk dinner the guests for the best--or perhaps the most challenging the Geruchssinne--fish can agree.
There is a live TV link to a presenter with a bow tie-clad surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Harvard".
It claps and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, possibly from the aquavit overwhelmed.
But perhaps it is but the severe haze of the whole fish.
