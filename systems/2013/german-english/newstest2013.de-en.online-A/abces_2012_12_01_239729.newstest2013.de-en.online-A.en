"Valentino is elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of couture", which opened this week in London, says ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of the lodging of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has recognised the designer at the opening of "Valentino - master of couture", a magnificent retrospective for the more than 130 dresses of Haute Couture created by its "Maison" in the last 50 years have been compiled.
"I love this Palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist "il signore" Garavani is, but do not have can be written without its distinguished clientele.
Valentino felt has always been fascinating for the stuffy and distant world of the aristocracy.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be until March 3, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the world's finest aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England until Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise of the modest fashion designers in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
To be in love, in the nobility must not be detrimental.
"At least she not escape their tipping on your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from pop music", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s, lived both in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all are glad if we were invited to his house in Gstaad," the ex-wife of "Heini" explains Thyssen tight friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has chosen has always been the elegance of celebrity.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza do not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went di Spagna in Rome after a fashion show at the Piazza to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including even Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music recognized and it felt its influence.
"All invited feel important and loved", recalls the "top model", which in 1995 began her career at the Haute Couture week in Paris.
"It never comes out of fashion, because his designs are works of art" she finally says...
Fashion show of the origin
Garavani's life is a story of obsession, more than mutual liaisons.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long runway, which proposes a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk, to admire a fantastic "audience", the masterpieces of Valentino wearing costumes, such as, for example, the dress that Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, chose, wore the Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a coat made of wool and leather, which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls broadcasting names such as the Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino's "unforgettable" like first love.
I can remember perfectly.
It was type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to everyone else because of his great love for the women and because it underlines our beauty", adds ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have plenty of light and highlight the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the Princess and Meinungsführende at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola D'Arenberg can not forget the first time, as she wore a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed to have to wear one of his evening dresses, the age and the opportunity...
At the end of the 1990s it was decided finally.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a neckline that makes honor to his name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d' Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend of fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian Aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg kept their evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "King" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to customize this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half metre long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the Supreme authority of the press, this dress at the end of the 20th century, "the return to customers the top society" was a milestone in Haute Couture.
For many years Valentino is tarnished with the "savoir-être" the elite, now your best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L ' ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Légion d'honneur, Garavani accumulated so many honors, such as any of the husbands of his customers.
"Always be refinement, his calm, his well-groomed and perfect appearance I noticed", admits D'Arenberg.
I've seen him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no marks on him".
And this says a Princess...
