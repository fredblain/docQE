A Constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt in relation to the Constitutional Declaration that temporarily grants him the unlimited power of Attorney, remains divided more than ever, he has decided to put everything on one card.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent Assembly will adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had granted this House two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt relies for almost two years now on a provisional, several times amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only caused a further split in the country.
For his opponents, the President remains in his "autocratic delirium" by still "breaks his word" and "is the law".
On pages of its proponents, we assured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period, which forced the brothers to give up explain the text section by section the Egyptians on their projects.
For the President it is also a way, to find its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest throughout the country rages.
After affirmations in an interview with the US weekly time Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians are honored to vote.
Especially since an ultimatum will be the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my design or I keep the unlimited power of Attorney", the latter should supposedly take an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
yesterday 85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent Assembly adopted the text in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals is not complied with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration mid-November they have turned away, because they believe that they have not been able, to bring their points of view.
Representatives have been equally by human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society.
To achieve the quorum, morning in haste were added to 11 people, Deputy members, yesterday.
The Muslim brothers, some are very closely related.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually unanimously adopted.
The commentators found it entertaining by the way, that the only controversy of the day... has come to the time for the prayer expressed as some members of the Panel of believe that the pendulum of the constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text that has been adopted yesterday evening still consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention, remains ultimately identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The salafistischen parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, hoped what would have made possible a stricter application to replace "the principles", with "the rules".
For the Islamists is the fact that this article was not changed a proof for their goodwill and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The Liberals, who see this only as a propaganda blow reciprocate "Hypocrisy".
Because according to them, is the Islamization of the Constitution on other articles.
They are especially articles 220 in the eye, which recognises a consultative role of Al-Azhar University, in particular as regards the examination of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is troubling because "those who prompted an opinion, are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy herein".
Fears the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next Rector of this University would be far less moderate than the present one.
"Currently no concrete religious commitment can be seen.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text, are academics who have been trained in the French system for the part, not ulema"appeased Alexis Blouet, who writes a thesis about the Egyptian Verfassungstransition.
He admits, however, "that in relation to the article 220 ambiguity can occur, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It particularly refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note d. red.].
And in the future could be raised the question to what extent before a civil court is competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, yesterday adopted text is heavily criticized due to the far-reaching powers he granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that compared are significantly reduced with the former regime.
A further point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military examination of defence is not the Parliament presented, but a National Defense Council.
As well, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have requested it.
The latter tell also their concerns in relation to the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy will be maintained, and insults are now banned, could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, refers more to the protection of women there is no article, underscores Heba Morayef of human rights watch.
In your opinion the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President yesterday had to speak out evening on television, this afternoon demonstrations are planned.
The supporters of the head of State will March on Saturday.
