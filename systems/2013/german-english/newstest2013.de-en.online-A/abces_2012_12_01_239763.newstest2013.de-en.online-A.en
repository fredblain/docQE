The most difficult profession of the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carrier of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and their health on the line if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, Rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are working literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives, by they get sulphur from the Vulkan Kawah Ijen in East of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this he must descend every day on the bottom of its crater, where solidified the escaping from the Earth sulfur-containing gas in contact with the air.
After he has broken out large stones of sulfur, can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders through the steep paths of stone.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 m, but the depleted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent at a turtle's pace, where they must keep the balance and carefully their steps so that they do not slip and fall.
You know that each step can cost your life, as happened to a French tourist, that crashed years ago on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram sulfur, which they remove.
Once at the top, make them the way between tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run three miles with the tiresome heavy baskets up to the scales, which has set up a mining company a little further down at an altitude of 1850 metres
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, that since 1960 the occurrences in the volcano and (never better said) exploited his workers, where 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilogram sulphur pays.
Which they then sold for each 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) on the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widely used and is used for the production of matches, Fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Because we are typically 70 kg, we get approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every way", explains Abdullahi, who makes three routes normally on the day.
For each route, he needed three hours, stating that he is completely managed, at the end of the day he has but then 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for a such seemingly inhuman effort, but is three times of what he would earn with the fieldwork.
"Had of the miners here, where the harvest paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income amounts to two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the bearer, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Abdullahi is family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, returned, and that with his reason, which is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought it to Java", to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hat often and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto continues three years his life on the Kawah Ijen on the game, its sulfur at the it already the first traces left, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, hat often and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work two more years here because I want to make a store or learn Spanish or French", he promises a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but floggings of life young man could work as tourist guides, waiters or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of wearing ass.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands at two o'clock every morning, because sulfur emanates at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the dark bluish shines.
Challenging the shadows, he rises in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he has purchased of his own money into the crater.
About 400 vehicles load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite their large profits has the mining company not mechanized reducing sulphur, to save costs, and delivers the carriers, who work on their own account and are paid according to their weight, no equipment.
You will receive also no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera charge the guardians of this natural park together with the entrance fee in the amount of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and the human wearing ass.
"This work is for the animals and not people" protested Madrusin, a burly, 42-year-old carrier, three decades since leaving school working on the Kawah Ijen.
He is capable of carrying up to 110 kg and insure that he continues, 'as long as it is", because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not go into retirement, I'll die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, if the wind suddenly turns and trapped the miners in the thick pillars that rise from the crater the men are so hard that no one on serious diseases complains... of course except the usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blow on their shoulders from the weight of the baskets have deformed.
With the basket on his back Unainik is with his 53 years only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions breaking 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano carried by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to camp in Tamansari 18 kilometres away.
"I will not go into retirement, I'll die here, because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains where he far opens his mouth in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest with his 30 years works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the misery continues generation to generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: the who work as human carriage in the Kawah Ijen.
