The film ARGO: when's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of who Islamic students occupied the American Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which had maintained the patronage of his regime over the decades.
For the American Government, there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because this would massively damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
She was not at the same time able to push through the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime resulted.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco of the violent attempt of the hostages made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were released after 444 days after negotiations were arranged by the Algerian Government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti Iranian moods at home.
The debacle in the Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film describes an episode of this story, which gave the United States a small partial victory ARGO of Director and actor Ben Affleck.
Six embassy employees immediately prior to the occupation of the Embassy managed to escape.
This ended after many complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
Succeeded to the CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from the Iran; helped them an extravagant story to mask their true identity – they travelled with Canadian passports masquerading as members of film staff who allegedly visited locations for a science fiction film in the country.
Combination of genres
He developed plan necessitated the cooperation of Hollywood by the experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez.
So the camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real Office.
The details of this operation were kept in long secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Monkey leaks film is a special combination of multiple film genres.
On the one hand he is a realistic thriller but also a so-called "caper movie", i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as, for example, the film ocean's eleven.
Thus the mood levels turns in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (iconic contemporary photographs are shown in the title sequence, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood that ironic and slightly exaggerated so come.
And then there are still scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, the Office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed a remarkable restarting of his career with this film.
A smiled actor has become a respected Director and as an actor he no longer is the aim of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third feature film after the crime no brainer (gone baby gone, 2007) and the thriller city no mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is monkeys leaks first film not playing in his native Boston of directed.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place among the features that took off the previous films of this Director of the standard Hollywood.
Affleck demonstrates this sense but also in ARGO, where Tehran "is played by Canada".
The best scenes in the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the Embassy is very impressive in its clarity, and conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere once yet.
A similar effect achieved Affleck with his team even when fictitious scenes (the wrong film crew at a Bazaar in Tehran).
Too much plot, too many places
The Director had to grapple also, that history offers not many really exciting scenes in terms of cinematic.
With the few he works but quite successful, where he sometimes helps the reality - which then not always so elegant effect (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran by a telephone call in America is averted, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat contrived).
The weakness of the ARGO is its too wide dispersion that is caused by the need to show too much story to many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood staffs but very charming, had their figures but deserves more space, and so they are by far not alone in the movie.
Monkey leak film loses some traction. It is a movie, you can follow and appreciate doing the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70's with some interest.
However difficult, he stirs passions.
As a reminder of a piece of living until today in some way history and as proof of how covered but the ideas of the Almighty and all-knowing intelligence services, it is however sufficient.
