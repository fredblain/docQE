Szab√≥: "Germans must play greater role"
Germany has abstain in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, of Berlin thus balances on a fine diplomatic line.
Deutsche Welle: earlier this week Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then, Berlin is included.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis in Gaza have done.
Now, Germany must be careful on the basis of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also supports not the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany abstained also the voice, when it came, to set up a no-fly zone.
It was finally enforced by NATO.
It difficult Germany to adopt a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that's right.
The reason is that it is just his foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed so to speak by the United States, a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
So the Germans can be found between the fronts against.
Is expected of them, that they play a more independent role, because they are but not used.
I think they grope is still on their role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Great Britain.
What is a "normal" foreign policy because from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to take positions that are independent of those of the United States or European partners with national interests.
I believe that the German foreign policy from economic policy is motivated, so of exports and its relations with certain regions, about Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different from those of the other great powers to a certain degree, and that is why Germany has to protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
For one, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful to meet the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries not to the head.
That plays a role in any case.
But I would want to not attach also the too much weight, which is not completely one-sided relationship.
But it plays an important role in German considerations in any case.
Germany damaged its relations with the United States, it has included important decisions of the voice such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding for the German position.
Therefore, I don't think that this was a breach of so dramatic as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will play a is even a certain respect.
Because it signals yet that it be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States have expressed their clear, however, for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European Nations?
These differences have always existed due to American domestic politics.
I believe that Obama's Government has secretly probably quite sympathetic to the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the Government may not represent public course this position.
I believe that the actual differences are not so big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so absolutely thrilled by Netanyahu's policies.
Hard it Germany to agree on its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and consistent European policy, which currently is not the case.
So, they cannot be part of a wider line and instead must advance things from their own position.
You do this just with the euro.
I think in the future, Germany will assume a leading role, to urge Europe to a European position.
This is of course not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It's always been a touchy subject.
But I think that the Germans is clear, that they must play a more independent role.
Sees itself as a major international player himself in the role Germany - Germany ever wants to assume a leading role?
Or the leadership is still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not accustomed, that is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is difficult still the country, to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, because various anti-German feelings be free each time, when Germany assumes a greater role.
This makes it not just the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be susceptible to various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Now continuously decreases the influence of the United States in European politics, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who remains otherwise?
The Germans are simply must play a greater role.
Even if you don't like them, it is unpleasant to them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
