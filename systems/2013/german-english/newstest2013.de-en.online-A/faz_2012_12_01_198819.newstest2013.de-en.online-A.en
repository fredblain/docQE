"Brand" in China: If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
A name officially registered in China, which however has nothing to do with the original company behind.
However, they enjoy protection as long as the actual namesake is not complaining.
And even then, it is not clear whether they get right.
"It will be increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China", says lawyer in the law firm Taylor Wessing, specialised on copyright infringement in the far East is Thomas Vinod hole.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
A few additional letters range the imitators, so that you may login to their brands.
So Lu-Gucci, rather than Prada is easy from Gucci man can wear Prada Kane.
Also German companies doing this legally copied, as the sporting goods manufacturer PUMA.
Patt hole opens a folder with entries of the Office in Beijing.
A Chinese company had there the trademark Zegna DF PUMA protect, an art name that is served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna at September 14, 2010.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in the copy and the injured of intellectual property rights.
In the big cities, there are multi-story department stores that sell almost exclusively to counterfeiting.
Patt hole cases but are different: on behalf of his clients take action, that Chinese companies officially received the right from the Trademark Office to use a label that is already elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a brand of the passenger.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
Thus, women are meant, fish are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
"This is bad for business, you must fight it", calls standoff hole.
"The brand will be diluted, the all setting disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and the costs of the sectors concerned going into the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the world's fastest growing in the year amounting to EUR 15 billion.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the register of trade marks are difficult to achieve, and go in the money.
Up to nine years the procedure can take, with an uncertain outcome.
Standoff holes reported cases in which the Court dismissed lawsuits, because after a long period the offending name has become the "market reality".
If the plaintiff have bad luck, he must pay even money the plagiarist because he violated its trademark in China, says Patt hole.
Sometimes, the law of the jungle reigns here.
Famous cases relate to graphical elements.
2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with a construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company, which recently took over the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese must use until today an emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo, commemorating the BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion company in China was defeated by generic from Hong Kong and Singapore, who look at the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The Btmo Crimson in Beijing although admits that there 2010 there were bottlenecks due to lower personnel and equipment.
Last year, it was but the "Emergency in the work flow returned to normal".
So, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings 22 per cent was dropped.
Almost 57,000 of such cases you have completed 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, wait in the Office still 81.500 appeals on registration.
To address costs much
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year more than 1.4 million applications received the Crimson on trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
That was a record and meant that China leads in a row to the list of new applications in all over the world for the tenth time, the authority shall.
That applies also to the inventory of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees had been captured.
This means simplified that any registration in the section cost 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
To address costs many times as shown in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the Group fights against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans could reach that its illegal production of fake automotive parts has been excavated.
But the generic still secured the Chinese rights to the brand of Freudenberg.
You missed that, because in Germany surnames could not be protected Hanno Wentzler, Chairman &amp; CEO of Freudenberg chemical Specialities in Munich says.
The Crimson Office also rejected the opposition of Munich.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got that right, but the defendant continues to fight until today.
You have to watch like hell
It is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the procedure is extremely expensive and cost us much time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly put a figure, the company archive have have to see through even a hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg of the opposite side offered a "high six-figure euro amount" to settle in vain.
"Because you can see how much this is worth", says Wentzler.
Back to splash the dangers in the far East are threatening even to Europe.
Namely, if there, imitators unprotected brands secure.
So, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to login name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business field, yet he could avert the registration.
"You have to watch like hell", says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer standoff hole advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, rather the foreigners should "everything that is somehow worthy of protection, apply also in China" as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registry.
In fact: If Freudenberg was subject in the last act of the drama of his brand, then you would probably pay royalties for the own name the opposite side, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed into the relevant segment of the market.
