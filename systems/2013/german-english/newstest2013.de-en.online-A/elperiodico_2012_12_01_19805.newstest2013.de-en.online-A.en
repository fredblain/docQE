El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years who are frequently on the net.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very private" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" if they applied it on the social networks.

I dispel me also my time with acquaintances.
"I would share a photo that is not from me, or from someone who makes the fool" he says.
The boy is about to write in clear, that it is wrong, obscene photos, naked, from crime to post, or abusive or violent comments.
Jorge assured knowing 35 friends in FB and nine Folger in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother, who has the password to one of the accounts.

"I don't know if me someone responds, I only upload" he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends" he specifies.

Even if someone empfähle him a stranger that he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year old José is different.

"This not startle me, because we have something in common, for example music", it specifies.
According to the boy has nobody made allusions to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone harassed me or calls me, I remove it easily from my user account" he admits.
José volunteered to ask, after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
Experiences are not unknown in the boys, which is now known as cyber-bullying.
The friend of a friend was blackmailed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim has not closed the account.
"He has made only private it."
Then, he explains a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
In contrast to Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he is unsympathetic or I one wants to wipe out him.
"But I know that this cyber-bullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, means that it must be understood to orient the children and young people, that it is a purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet arose as a medium for searching for information; with the advent of these pages but the rules of the game have changed", she says.
Porras explains that the academics of Marc Prensky, holder of a Masters qualification in education at Yale University and author of the 'Digital Natives and Immigrants' forming these concepts to the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that they should teach, where we learn but even," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we demand of them a defined criterion also having, what may be disseminated, published or said, and this in an age where the maturity that is not sufficient."
"You should be also picky when it is most important to them to be popular to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", he adds.
According to the specialist is the most effective manner, to teach the children and young people, what is privacy to ask them questions that bring them to think.
He says "to tell them that they should not do it, doesn't".
Porras is called then some options: there are things that you would not tell a stranger. Why do you do it then on the Internet?
Or, would you like it, when it published a photo of yourself, like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what the other about you publish?
Have you asked before the others for permission altogether, if you've tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: all need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to understand them to announce that they must act online as they do offline.
There are the same rules.
"Is someone outside of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to the social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, University Professor, school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it indispensable that parents carefully read through the policies of social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have solid basis to talk with their children about the importance of the opening of one user account on the Internet.
He says "For example, the age, or what you can share or publish".
According to Guardia, the children must be remembered the lesson "You should not talk to strangers".
