World AIDS Day: Stomp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi - choir rehearses and AIDS orphans in Swaziland is getting happy.
The story of a connection that transcends more than 8733 kilometers.
First is the pounding: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and Mr slipper look for the clock on the parquet floor, find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Only then, the voices of the singers swell slowly - Alto, bass, tenor and soprano - press, beguile and traced.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year old conductor, lifts it almost out of his cloth shoes if he merges it with his smooth wild gestures.
It's Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg is the Imbongi choir rehearsing a new song.
50 Singers and singers are come, aged between 23 and 69, from the geneticist and the Hausmann.
' OM'Obani "is no easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and it even in a very foreign language: Zulu, that eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and is spoken in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are approximately 34 million infected with HIV, UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations for the treatment of AIDS, your estimates.
23.5 Million people living in southern of Africa.
245000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now living with HIV.
The Association voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in Esitjeni village.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
You can take on a sponsorship for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniforms and a warm meal daily in the GoGo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means storytellers or even Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language fluency can nobody in this room but sing.
The choir practice songs in this foreign soft language for almost ten years and she returns, and even then, where they originally come from: in the South of Africa.
Because 8 733 km as the crow flies from Heidelberg Centre in the Northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some in simple mud and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents more, because they have succumbed to HIV.
Evident in Esitjeni in small, how very Swaziland suffers from: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Clipping the male foreskin, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people of Swaziland have the immunodeficiency virus, not uncommon with mid thirties to die.
In a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only on parental care but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without education, you have certainly no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was a child to the school to send still private commitment of individuals, for a couple of bucks a year and to allow him a hot meal of the day.
But a year later the choir founded the Association "Voices for Africa", which is since almost professionally caring for orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the major sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common Viral STI are HIV, human Pappilomaviren Herpes herpes or hepatitis.
The parasitic STI include Pubic Lice and scabies.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute expects that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In the heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human Pappilomaviren are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is among heterosexual adults in this country relatively small - yet: 20 percent of the new HIV infections accounted for by this group.
Among young people, chlamydial infections occur much more frequently than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years.
In this country, also human Pappilomaviren in adolescents occur frequently.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis cases has more than doubled according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in the year 2001 on 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections is decreasing since 2007.
2011 there have been cases around 2700.
This is approximately one-tenth less than in the previous year.

Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, vaginal discharge, pelvic pain and blisters or warts.
Often, they can however cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but not offer full protection.
Because some pathogens can be passed sexually transmitted diseases lubrication infections with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts especially for frequently changing sexual partners recommend regular testing.
Early diagnosed can be cured most STI and prevent complications.
Through sponsorships, donations, and last but not least the fees which the choir in whole Germany he sings himself, a lot comes together.
"Overall we have sent around 200 000 euro Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the Chairman of the Association.
In the village itself managed a confident and assertive woman, Zodwa Dlamini, the money from Germany.
You also care that the orphans is well accommodate at one of the grandmothers about.
The Gogos, as it is called the old women to Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans to, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms every day appear just in time for school.
Who is no more, is a single woman who is paid by the Association as well as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children in the shelter Khanyisile.
Also, "Voices for Africa" has let a sewing school in life called, make two chicken houses built and organized jointly with the American Health Organisation PSI, that many in the village have an HIV test.
This is not self-evident, because the disease across the country also is so obvious, one silent dead prefer them.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country in which the King is officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is due that the HIV virus has so quickly spread in the past few decades this state-sanctioned way of life.
But also the many migrant, which carry the virus across the country.
There free condoms while at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, travels every two, three years jointly by the South of Africa's Imbongi choir and singing songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence, and black self-esteem, who know many of the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of white, singing songs in a black - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has defied that even some fierce border guards a few tears.
The journey takes whatever to Esitjeni, where the singer can visit their godchildren.
Even though one hardly finds the small village on maps, in the Valley of the Ezulweni River, it is more than known.
"After Esitjeni, because the light is" the people there say.
And if the 8733 kilometres as the crow flies return to Heidelberg, to the pounding singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Stra√üe, then one sees shine there too.
