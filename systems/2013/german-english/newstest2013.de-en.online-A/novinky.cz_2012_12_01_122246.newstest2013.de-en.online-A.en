Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year gets a poll about the most absurd charges, has decided this year to organise the competition "Most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the plan put forward recently by the European Union to introduce a women's quota of 40% in the management of large European companies brought us," said Patrik Nacher, which deals with the Organization of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice about the unification of insurance tariffs for men and women is located under the nominated absurdities.
Until then, women for life insurance enjoyed an advantage because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU may be nominated by the end this year.
The actual voting takes place until end of February 2013 ", after communicated.
The binding incorporation of bioethanol for fuels include the controversial EU regulations, which consequently damaging nature is banning the reliable Mercury thermometer, just because they contain a relatively small volume of this dangerous substance, or the directive to the size of chicken cages, because of the eggs were much more expensive this year, also.
Criticism was also the de facto ban on the use of the term "Butter spread" or even the sales ban on conventional light bulbs in the past.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU machine will often decide under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose Forderungen in Brussels generally by one or several Member States are represented (so tried Czech Republic at present, for example, to enforce the claims of Czech banks with veto threat).
Also, lobby interests stood behind that bananas of the highest grade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and may have no "curvature abnormality".
The European Commission defended this with the argument that she harmonize only the non-uniform national rules that would hamper trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been softened already by the EU against the resistance of some countries stating that the previous policy would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the regulation last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons on sale with the note, that children may inflate the balloon without adult supervision under eight years of age.
The EU invoked an American study, which are the leading cause of the death by suffocation of children in accordance with balloons.
A similar restriction applies already for children till 14 years old when using fair trumpet.
There are curious ideas at home
Also a policy that pertains to the European officials themselves is relatively absurd - everyone who has a formal role in the EU, may use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated fair in addition to the above absurdities in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists laissez also the EU regulation on the scope of laying on the territory of a Member State.
Thus, the EU put the maximum volume of laying fixed, which was allowed to be on the day of our accession to the EU on the territory of the Czech Republic.
Czech Republic exceeded then E.g. the set volume for mushroom preserves, what a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were impressed by the idea that certain countries should get money for this, that they have no sea, or by the idea to give funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were admittedly not from Brussels but from Prague.
"We are thus at a disadvantage, having no sea.
We will request a refund to the EU", the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav said Palas (ČSSD) in the fall of 2004.
As an argument, he stated that the harvest was very high and the State bearing as a result of the so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded.
Czech Republic have another way to seaports, the EU according to Palas should pay hundreds of millions of euro to us.
The European Commission met Czech Republic finally so far that she organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
For requests for funding, the regional development Ministry chaired by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) offered funding communities, specifically there should be funds for the preparation of grant money applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are the EU efforts to regulate in the Member States, to a target of criticism, and thus to effectiveness and development of throughout the European Union deserves recognition according to some experts, but rather.
According to these experts, the EU funding for projects that together have nothing with the deepening of European integration, which however were enforced by individual Member States in the budget negotiations in are more likely a more serious problem.
Emotions causes in this country the fact that Czech Republic like other Member countries in Brussels the right to use specific names of traditional products must fight and while not always wins this fight.
Czech Republic could although after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria the designation "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to rename our manufacturers but "Tuzemák".
The designation rum may be used only for products from sugar cane distillate products from sugar beet.
Rusk, carp from Pohořelice, and Třeboň, or also the Saaz hops appear in society of the world famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or of Parma ham of now of Carlsbad in the official list of products registered in the EU.
With a EU trade mark, the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořice rolls can boast as.
