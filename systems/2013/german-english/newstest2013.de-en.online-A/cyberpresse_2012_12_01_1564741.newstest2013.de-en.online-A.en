Prostate cancer screening: should the test be or not done?
The PSA test would in fact sometimes erroneous results with false negative and false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions, or.
This leads to greater hesitation of already undecided men for carrying out screening tests.
Should the test be or not done?
We have obtained the opinion of two physicians.
In studies conducted in the United States, many confounding factors between the control groups were so it is difficult to interpret this data and to provide clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that in a follow-up after 12 years the probability of the formation of metastases is up 40% higher at 30, when no screening was done.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years, when you have a direct relative, which already was suffering from prostate cancer.
There is a higher risk in African-American men also.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are types of cancer, the aggressive and others who are indolent.
The extent of the risk of his cancer must be made really understood the patient by the possible options are shown him which prostate cancers can remain untreated, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long run, and you rather decide in these cases for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, no treatment occurs in many men, in which it recognized cancer, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them a treatment at progression of the disease.
With increasing precision to determine the criteria for a decision who should be treated and who is not.
Therefore, I recommend performing the test anyway.
It is but most important, to speak, to determine whether he should be or not be performed with his physician.
In cooperation with the international society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is not a panacea for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the advances in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk to get sick to him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough.
"If there were no smoking, this value would rise at least to 50 %", emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However it is assumed that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against the tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of cancer to die by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of illness.
You seem the risk of breast, Grimmdarm-, rectum, esophagus, to increase pancreatic cancer and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout life," he adds.
The nutrition
The organization also recommends that you limit the consumption of red meat.
In excessive amounts, it increases the risk of a Grimm or rectal cancer.
Meats should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their investigations are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the vitamin E studies are contradictory.
While a study found reducing the risk of prostate cancer, another rather showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was also still not clearly pointed out.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed how important it is to speak with his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
