Daily drink butter - and be 168 years old
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical old age.
There is even a Museum for longevity.

A search for traces in the country, in which 97-Jährige are still comparatively young.
The trip by the Talysh mountains is romantic to name a few.
The van rumbles on the winding road, past thickly wooded hills, raging rivers and simple houses.
Everything is green and lush, you might think that it would be in the black forest.
But this is the deepest South of Azerbaijan, the border with the Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of which not much is known except that she speaks perfect Persian as well as Aserisch and is very durable.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small town is set to solid crisis architecture from Soviet times who wants to so do not even fit in the scenic mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe come here barely, the directions of Azerbaijan capital Baku is too burdensome.
For the 323 kilometers it eight hours is necessary because the road is only single lane.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is not here yet arrived in the province.
But Pileta Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the makings of the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - next year, we have a Festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulayeva.
She is the Director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the Vita by eight dozen Talysh is documented from the area, which shows older than 100th on a black and white photo Fatulayeva.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years begotten a child
But the controversial star of the Museum is the Shepherd of Şirali Müslümov which should have become at the age of 168.
However, there is not a birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented man who was 122 years old Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died", explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he should have begotten a daughter.
Has Şirali Müslümov miscalculated so his age by a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Germany, has heard of the "very old" in Central Asia.
"There are remarkably many elderly people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "live in Sardinia extremely many very old men".
Due to missing documents, but no scientific proof of the age was to lead, because registers were missing.
Every day way cup melted butter
But the fact is that the people in the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
Currently, there are 20 persons who are older than 100 years.
So why live here in the South so many elderly?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh said with the special genes of the Talysh.
Director Fatulayeva, however, believes that it was the diet.
But that precisely the rich diet of the Talysh to be as healthy, who love bread, meat and especially dairy products and of which drink many a glass of daily melted butter, seems hardly plausible from a safety perspective.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Jack Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, living in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter churn, which she relentlessly back and forth rolls.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents long ago.
Two toddlers jumping around.
In the kitchen to prepare tea, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped glasses of Armadu guests.
Mirzayevas are perfectly white teeth in row and limb under her headscarf conceals them long, dark blonde braids, her son proudly unveiled before us.
I washed my hair with milk, so they never went out me and kept their color.
"I have never used shampoo", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to life
She has eaten only that what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I've bought not a single time in the supermarket food.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the second world war.
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult, driven to the father figure of the nation who ruled his country like a dictator, knows almost no bounds in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need under Azerbaijan old.
An amount by which one can live well receives 230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for local conditions.
And maybe even Mirzayevas long graying son is right: "The old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
