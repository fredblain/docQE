A Republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the latter keeps the Brennan Center, for a myth by it reaffirms that electoral fraud in the United States is less common than the number of people killed by the lightning.
The Republican lawyers have listed over 10 years in the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new rules are on the voter turnout negatively impact.
In this sense, these measures partly undermined the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the United States for the holding of elections in the Member States are responsible.
In this sense, the majority of American Governments has announced new laws since 2009, which complicate the procedure for registering or voting.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections of November 2010, involving 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States were listed.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced alone in 2011, that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, laws be shortened by this also the period for early voting, that legal void explains to register on election day as voters and citizens denied the right to vote, for the a court exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no US State voters demanded to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first State that has levied a such demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other countries.
In the last two years they promoted in 34 States legislation forced voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that US citizens opposed to Quebec do not have a universal identification card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million people eligible to vote have a photo ID issued by a government authority of its State.
In addition, five million new voters have in 2012 does not have a such card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to pay to obtain the required certificate.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans have 15% of persons with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age does not have the required ID.
This goes further still.
It is not allowed to use their photo ID issued by its establishment students who give voters are considered, which increased their votes for Democratic candidates, in several States.
On the other hand, same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations, who choose more for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no State for choosing has requested a proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first State to introduced a such demand.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws, demanding voters, they prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures clearly aimed to limit the Hispanic vote.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters, favor the Democratic Party.
Moreover, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 laws in eight States, with which the registration was abolished by voters on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the voter registration in the general election of 2004 to to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of registration of new voters has fallen 2010 compared to 2006 to 17%.
In addition, Republican legislatures in five other States have adopted legislation aiming to shorten the period for early voting.
2008 In Florida, for example, were 33% of voters who in advance have chosen, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of voters of the State in the general election.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of voters off, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the white, representing 76% of voters made only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters have contrasted himself vigorously the adoption of laws, restricting voter registration.
Several legislative proposals have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic Governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
Partly, you could limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States have adopted legislation requiring showing photo identification.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics decry the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in States crucial for 2012.
A report of the Brennan Center 2011 shows that those States that have adopted this legislation make 171 of the 270 votes, which are needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes in legislation on the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new rules are on the voter turnout negatively impact.
In this sense, these measures partly undermined the democratic system of the United States.
