Interior Ministry ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons to extremely low crime
The Russian Interior Ministry plans an intensification of the Firearms Act for private gun owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: wounded in shootings on weddings, as well as seven killed in the rampage of the Moscow lawyers Dmitri Winogradow.
The police will ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for acquiring firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the Chairman of the Duma Committee on security and fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, has supported and promised that the changes to the weapons law in the near future be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems through "Attraction of the screws".
An open letter was published in the Internet and whose Verfasser - representatives of various associations of weapon - by the authorities asking to refrain from "mindless restrictions".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is Vasiliy Lesnikow, the BBC's Russian service very low, the jurist said.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes with application of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012 were made, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period as a whole.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will hold criminals not to operate on the black market.
Currently, you can find the authors according to every possible weapon for very little money in Moscow.
Meanwhile the Interior Ministry stressed that the proliferation of illegal weapons under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach across multiple channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, tells a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of education and the General staff.

The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers, as well as the Caucasians itself both", says Baranez.
Illegal weapons are stolen by criminal police come on the second channel.
Baranez explains that these include weapons that were stolen from the armouries of the police as well as directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
More illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals.
Many military camps occurred frequently to explosions.
"There is evidence that it was in some cases to arson, to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Weapon manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market in accordance with Baranez.
"Today there are countless private RÃ¼stungsfabriken that not withstanding international competition and thus squander the weapons under the hand on the black market, in Moscow,", the expert reports.
Another channel of the black is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes small-scale production as well as a mafia, who organized the smuggling", explained the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated how much of each of the five channels on the delivery of the black with illegal weapons has about.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for problem analysis and State administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal service of State statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of the illegal weapons comes the investigators that by the army and the law protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are through there that "guilt by managers who do their work with weapons", it is said in the report.
According to the data of the research, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are due to thefts of weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
By a salesperson of of a weapon store, which will be named assures that long no one buys weapons that are found during illegal excavations, because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common dealer to get the supplies in a weapons cache.
A weapon, for example a pistol of the type TT, is bought via an Ensign.
The weapon is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon in the city and sells them there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he tells
"The police know of course about and performs therefore, if she cannot keep up the plan to expose white-colllar crime, periodically at retailers control purchases offered by illegal weapons", adds the sales consultants.
"As in the luxury shop"
Most often, buyers and sellers find each other through acquaintances.
I had seen on Web sites and blogs I, as someone on me was attentive and suggested me to the station "Begovaya", where a person would wait for me, which led me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
I was told the price of the weapon only
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"I need a friend who has contacts to get a weapon,", tells of the salesperson. "I have as an acquaintance, but I don't trust him".
There are traders on the markets, but there you must go and to arrange with a code like "by Iwan Iwanowitsch, which set out that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm currently on some knuckles over a friend who I trust.
He supplies me also just so the knuckles, because he knows that I be not whistle it.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways.
The former military members Viktor Baranez tried mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this topic.
The schemas have not changed, according to him.
He got a photo album, where "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," recalls the military personnel.
The buyer gets not the cat in the bag according to Baranez, but can try everything.
I don't just buy as a potential customer, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we set up a bulls-eye.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop from your sofa
Internet search engines see search results to Web pages and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons "for different purposes" are offered.

There, users give up your orders and requests.
