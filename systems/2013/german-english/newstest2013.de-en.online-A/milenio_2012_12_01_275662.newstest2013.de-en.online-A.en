Cause of a death due to AIDS is today a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed him the test results: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment in which he was diagnosed the doctor without apparent success to mitigate "tried".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of just about his illness and started to know; and this with such usage, that he celebrated just his 43rd birthday.
He is without a doubt one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, there were many doubts, a few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, himself the Director of a clinic of the IMSS refused to say goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However still many people in the clinic, who know nothing of their disease and where the virus has already done damage and has exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 Years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success means today, that the survival of a patient in a timely manner taking the treatment, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that this information had been backed in April of this year by a reputable scientific publication.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded in 2008 that AIDS was a death sentence, although, that but the years of survival and quality of life depend the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of the treatment, and that those had greater opportunities that are not drug addicts: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that who gets HIV-positive at the age of 25 years of diagnosis, "can be easily 75 years old in this sense, as long as he is under control", this expert said.
To properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans is today an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate significantly has decreased in recent years (in Mexico the number of people dying of AIDS, has come down from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of UNAIDS)), it is still true that 60 percent of patients in the national database have died since the advent of AIDS.
Alone in Jalisco, 255 people were killed in the year 2011, and up to the month of may of this year, there are already 187 deaths; However, it is assured that there is universal access to the antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
-Why die people so still it?
-In my opinion the problem is not access to the treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in the very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. To be able to influence, to the global mortality earlier diagnoses are so massively screening tests must be offered all persons where this is required, required."
Experts and officials of the Council approve this proposal Estatal de Prevención del SIDA en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio to, who had his test at a private lab, and this reason only, because a friend of his had made it, who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age, and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), what is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they are going to die, and would hear nothing.
It is said "If I must die already, then prefer three times burst", in my case.
The change was to the towards improvement, I feed myself well, do sports and take the drugs.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
Also, I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, doing much, have an active and responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details, to animate those with his testimony that fear within the framework of the World AIDS Day today with MILENIO JALISCO enumerates.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. Once they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to can live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and the commoners are large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, which has adopted the cause of HIV.
And the most important is prevention.
The places for this purpose "the distribution increased actually condoms; earlier they were given individually, now they give us packages with one hundred pieces, which is already good, there are still people who do not have access to a condom,"he said.
Young people are among the people at risk of new infections.
"Why do you need that?" is a common question of ridicule by social workers, in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, the young people would not expose the correspondent assured orientation staff.
He proposed to orient this inefficient distribution; Condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets by facilities that are frequented by young people.
It should be encouraged not promiscuity.
It should be paid not the beer and Motel them, as the Governor Emilio González to the question answered whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not looks like this; It is best, to bring condoms to those who already engage in any sexual activity", he brought it to the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is nationally seen in 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection via sexual intercourse, 6% of the blood, and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people with HIV live, because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case who do not know it.
