The MVRDV architects prove that are the true adventure not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Buchberg - 2 photos
"Funny, I find the building, it looks futuristic, and finally there to see again something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, a bystander on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big, says: "However, it is beautiful the House already."
But I was wondering what we need today a library.
All of them have Internet, iPad, E-books.
Is no man today still volunteered in one of these old-style libraries, or?
Spijkenisse, a little visit needy bedroom community on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The community of 80,000 residents is the lowest formation rate of the entire Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid situation, it was decided some time ago to contribute to the education and to develop the seven fictional bridges which are shown on the euro notes, as pretty bepinselte steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the education campaign has been limited.
And so the city fathers recognized that there would be only a single way to tackle the statistics: A library must create!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architects MVRDV, master of the magnificent bar charts and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took the thing with his usual aplomb and appeared at the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under her arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury still puzzled looked around and jerked with the armpits, stacked the cheeky Meuse his exquisite gift size to a pyramid and finished his ist based speech with the words: "Love town!"
Thats it so my suggestion for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Bökenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is filled up.
He is part of a revitalization project, include also underground car park, supermarket, post and a few adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November the Buchberg was awarded with the second prize of "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project for the Dutch national wood award 2012 has been nominated.
So is the faceless small-town retort, which had to offer up to date no longer than for a piece of contemporary architecture richer a postmodern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly Town Hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public involved in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: book paradise under a cheese cover.
Although there is a lift which runs through the middle of the mountain, but the real space and reading revolution opens at foot-barreled climb the topography.
The fully glazed interior is bright and clearly, speak the language of a public square of burnt brick floor and the elegant street lights unequivocally.
The urban ambience is perfect.
It is looking for already park bench, dog and football of playing boys and girls.
And anywhere books, books, books.
"The bookshelves along the façade are typically available, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says winy Maas.
We have the classic space configuration on the head and put the reading pane from inside to outside.
The Interior of the book Mountain is cleverly used: in the middle there are offices, Internet-based library, Chess Club, environmental centre and Home Automation Control Panel.
The black bookcases are a special joy, the time wall tiling, times times staircase railings are sill,.
Look, feel, and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads whether the unknown material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so we have encountered a suitable waste from agriculture in a Frisian farm someday.
For many years using a millimeter-thin plastic mat in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields as a root base.
This is low-cost and time-efficient.
The thin fabric holds one or two seasons, then it is ready for the bulky waste.
The fleece - pressed for the first time to four inches thick plates in these quantities - for the library.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, strain-enabled material turns, a fun new cars and a riding shoe smell.
After 105 steps, one has arrived at the Summit.
At the end of almost 500 meters long wandering, you are rewarded in the literary Café not only with fantastic views over the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted Ficusbäumen.
You create atmosphere, but especially for the correct humidity in the literature.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it Yes, but this House is a flagship project in terms of ecology despite the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
Is the heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the book Mountain stands under a glass globe, the sun shines only briefly in the Interior even on sunny days.
The wide glued binders, which are transverse to the glass facade, serve as shade and intercept much of the sunlight.
The climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already dared their way into the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Bökenberg even called Spijkenisses 'long overdue soul'.
The reason: opening a few weeks ago every inhabitant was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
Thus, the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 units - are to be filled for the time being once.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled capacity.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, now every inhabitant has a certain relationship to this new House.
Everyone knows that his book part of this building is.
And if it is only for decoration.
Thus, those Supreme discipline succeeded MVRDV, which is called in the jargon of identity.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
It may be so young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a starting point for identity.
