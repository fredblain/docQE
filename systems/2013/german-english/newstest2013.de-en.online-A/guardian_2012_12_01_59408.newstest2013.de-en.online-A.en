Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are equal for all tobacco brands
The world's first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws are in force in Australia. So brand logos and colours be replaced by neutral, olive green cover, which are printed in addition to dramatic images showing diseased body parts and babies affected by cigarette smoke and children.
Aside from the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packs in the brand name, which are printed in identical, small font is coming Saturday.
Thus, Australia leads the world's strictest rules on tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco use will be eliminated.
In this respect the Government assumes studies, which showed that people who still do not have started to smoke with 26, also no longer will start with 99% probability.
"You can see with children of young age, that they understand the message, try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image", so Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cited studies that have shown that children associate the Crown of of logo with the idea of a Princess, for example.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and only slightly changes will affect the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said with the laws the black-market trade would favors, what would lead to cheaper and easier-to-reach cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra HA by Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand greatly increased after cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging, since corporations British American tobacco, Britain's Imperial tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan tobacco have failed two months ago Australian Supreme Court with its challenge of the laws.
Zico had sold to wholesale stores up to 6,000 units and wait for new stocks.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media is exactly the population to whom the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbids them to act as sports sponsors, and forced most traders no longer put out cigarettes in stores. Now, the tobacco advertising on the Internet has changed.
The Australian Government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and sites, has not have any influence on international sites.
"Who marketed tobacco and has only a small area, to promote its products, does not get around the Internet", says Becky Freeman, researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted a surge in reports to brand authored by "ordinary people".
We must ask ourselves the question: that's just a private citizen, which takes so much pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes to take on even a video for it - or a marketing agency that has to do?
British American tobacco Australia says, that is the industry instead of marketing to focus, to deal with the new legislation.
She has gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules â€“ those countries complain at the World Trade Organization over unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries has greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Plibersek according the Government has held talks with other countries who are considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country which prescribed photographic warnings.
Meanwhile, these were expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and the Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show defiantly.
The images do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"It simply takes a butt and puts away the box," Victor El says Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes, on which a photo with a mouth tumour is printed.
Honestly speaking there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade in "King of the Pack" in the Centre of Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made filling his shelves.
"Previously I needed an hour to sort a delivery now I need four," Yu says.
"The Government would have to completely ban cigarettes - then we had okay said that's it, sealing," he adds visibly angrily.
