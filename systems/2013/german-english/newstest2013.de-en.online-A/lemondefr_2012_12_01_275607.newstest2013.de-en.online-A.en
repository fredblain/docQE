He also confessed to have organized an illegal raising of funds for the former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, the costs of which have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, from the construction company golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to 736.000 dollars in Exchange for sewer contracts, whose cost he artificially swelled.
Other officials of the highways have admitted that they lubricate left by them artificially extent on invoices with false benefits by 30-40%.

We are here to clean the wound, an investigation unit only for Montreal, as well as a supervision need however to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean turn.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau noted in turn that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", is especially thought about the role of "elected representatives, who are about the tactics in the picture", if they were not involved in the scam!
In a proportion of 70% of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I was told that this is only a weak ripoff of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to restrict the donations to parties, to $100 which would alter the situation according to him: "As long as the campaign spending are not strictly limited, dirty money in politics in circulation will be."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of parties: "we can not lower fall; by we are the things with courage to the bottom, we can reconstruct the House on a more solid foundation with more controls and laws."
If this story will damage the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about it to look in their own backyard.
