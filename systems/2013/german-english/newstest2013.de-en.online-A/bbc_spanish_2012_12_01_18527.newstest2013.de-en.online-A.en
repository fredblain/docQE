Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame that they have no children on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: we fulfil our duty, and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verse part of an advertisement for mints are yet - or just because of that - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The records are part of a rapper songs, of local proverbs such as "push is a"bao"(loaf) into the oven, to make you funny about the low birth rate in Singapore."
The advertising agency BBH, which has filmed the video, preserves the hope that reached the commercial in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Its Creative Director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to meet their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to design funny and humorous.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When planting continues, we are the worst in the world, therefore, we realized that it is a topic to which we had to take care.
We knew that the Government had tried much, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization by speed-dating evenings (fast flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but does not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why do we not something as creative as possible to address this problem, like for example a rap to compose?
1.2 Children
If you cannot easily take this topic, is the Government of Singapore.
Every year it spends US$ 1,300 for policies to stimulate the citizens to have more children.
A package of the Government for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had so far little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech City-State in Southeast of Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national authority of the population, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
Was the last time this rate--2 - what is known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why the Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the marriage and family policy of the national population agency, says that this is due to a "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled the people, except to marry and form to have more options in terms of goals and priorities a family", she explains.
These changes in the social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of single adults and delaying marriage and births, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile led an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in the migration to prevent the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where blooms the barely clad xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized, that they can keep wages low and do not integrate.
The rise in immigration is regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year posted their worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher fees and duties for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, the cost of health and immigration policy, the Singapore shows unexpected consequences.
The Government is trying to achieve that not so many small flats will be built.
So, she has also impact on the housing market.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "Shoeboxes" and may be installed in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, the concern is that they can promote the lifestyle of single adults, and that they deter the construction thereof, to build large apartment for families.
But Lim yew soon, General Director of real estate company of EL developers, says that his "shoeboxes" can be very sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units sold out faster than the larger units are days and even weeks.
As a result, they are much better for our Cash Flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give clearer guidelines to developers which previously created obstacles in the way, if you wanted to build too many small units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birthrate, the talks with the Singaporeans, who work in the financial district, is to see that they will have no great effect.
"People are highly stressed, the apartments and also the education are so it is pushed out of many expensive," says one young Manager.
The children can get the others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time" says an other, approximately twenty-year-old man.
Men and women their careers, the stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons for this cause that they can have no children.
Therefore the Singaporeans have since, when it comes to having children - the last word the Government can do so much.
