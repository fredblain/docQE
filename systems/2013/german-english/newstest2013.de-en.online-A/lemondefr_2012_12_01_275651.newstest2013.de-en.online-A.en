"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, they took on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can tell it by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I'm doing every day on their side progress.
The technical staff has also been much me.
These elements inspire me every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I do not break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the Centre of preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my time at Saint-Ã‰tienne I did always gradually progress.
Make the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti is therefore advantage...
The new additions of this summer are accustomed to play games very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
As a result, that a player has to offer the forehead like me, and wants to give his best.
By the way much in terms of my playing position gives me of Carlo Ancelotti.
He is supported by co coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect to all technicians.
In Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He can look back on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I have had an encouraging discussion with him.
At that time, I had recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
Lyon took the place of the leader in the French Ligue 1.
But we lurk in ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important goals: we have qualified in this manner for the knockout stage.
What is the goal of the Association in this competition?
We will try to get as much as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
But we will have to talk with our word against very good European teams.
First, we want to be first our group before postage so that we can carry out the second leg of the knockout final as a match.
Can a big European club be of the PSG in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and get a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially the PSG gives the means for this undertaking to accept concrete forms.
It would be a great failure to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year it is really to the heart, to get this title.
Last season we were close.
In may, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry them the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally, you should be with 79 points master be...
But another team that has those of Montpellier, an even better season scored.
I believe that this year is the right thing.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux to the title of wrestling, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media too much by the PSG expect?
Bearing in mind what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that many of us expected.
We accept it completely.
If we win but with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and there is still something, what one can accuse us, which is somewhat frustrating.
One wonders what people still expect.
We could win never every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to make a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
We have proven strength in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, a club which fails to qualify for the knockout stage for two seasons and also huge expenditure has made!
With regard to the invested sums believed lead you to the game break with 15 points!
This would mean that our opponents and the French Championship consideration would be left.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were of this new PSG "geboostet".
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we may be the smiling winner a month and tell us that we have won it despite all the difficulties eventually.
The PSG seems to depend completely from the services provided by Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that is called a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This inspires the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders around the world, also makes it possible for everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was me in the heart, to take part in this EM.
Unfortunately, because my injury has prevented me to knock out some playing time.
There, I've seen things from which I strengthened went out.
Today I manage to make good games for the national team.
This was my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in the Ukraine, we have learned our lesson and today we must create an exemplary behaviour on the day.
What opinion do you have to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying Group for the World Cup.
The coach is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by he had qualified us for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Represents the force on 16 October in Spain draw (1:1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
Prior to this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a comparable game in my career.
