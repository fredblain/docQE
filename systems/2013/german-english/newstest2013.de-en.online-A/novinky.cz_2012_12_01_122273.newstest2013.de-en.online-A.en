"People want that I'll save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr Senator, how to get the idea to run for President?
I'm not about to be Senator or President.
If everything would work in our country, I would not run.
But I can not longer see how the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free while the taxes and the retirement age increase the people.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
When I see something but, what you don't like me, then I try a solution to propose to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and to do so independently and no party affiliation, I have no other way to influence things, as for the Office of a Senator or the President run again.
In the Senate, you have succeeded and made then same on the way to the Castle.
Turn not your constituents back to this?
I've told all the time that I will take the fight to the Castle after the results of the senatorial elections.
Later I clarified this, and said that I would run for the Presidency if I am elected to the Senate.
But, my goal is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence and a possible strong mandate.
The difficulty is not only that we as a people in the pub and in front of the TV rant, but cut down anyone who wants to make a difference.
To get the media who want to Rob one of the honor and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
About me was that I would bribe journalists or that I was Adviser to Jiří Paroubek said, for example.
Let's talk about your vision.
You took the fight to the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians as well as retroactive declarations about 20 million crowns.
To do this, you must change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
I've campaigned as a simple citizen me that the Guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small mind policy - when someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and only keeps on the population.
I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in the Parliament as an independent politician.
My advantage is that I can take the me without drawer thinking and party dogmas by any party, what is best for our country.
Look left or right as a human being in politics rather?
From the Czech perspective seems to me that people see me left.
For me, this right-left thinking is totally unimportant.
For me, it is important that we make progress.
It is not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right wing; I would like to connect people.
Always I endorse publicly any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and also I will turn myself against bad ideas.
It displeases you, if someone called you the populists.
But confirm that not by what you have just said?
If you are a business plan in a company, then you have also an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this.
This may be because of me as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world already, or they have been discussed by key experts.
But only tags remain without support in the Parliament.
And thus to get in the long run not far in politics.
Or do you think that, if you're talking just long enough with the people, will succeed you, to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and to try on our side to bring them to enforce these goals.
As President, there would be no problem, the Chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to urge, to anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors by law for me.
And the addressed should then say why they reject this.
A strong personality that draws attention to abuses, to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President, which was one of the merits of public pressure only once.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy, I have only just begun to and trying to find the support of the majority of my program.
I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn't work out, then I go back again in six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little, as if Okamura Czech Republic should save.
I'm no Savior.
I know that I alone do nothing; Therefore, I have spoken with several celebrities about whether she would run for the Senate.
For example, I have talked Radim Jančura, but declined due to overwork.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which revealed the fraud in trade with light fuel oil.
My candidacy, I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now, I'm no longer sure.
Sixty-five percent of the electorate have gone at all not on the elections, and those who have gone, have chosen mostly representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
The people have chosen such a composition of Senate changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions for the direct election of mayors and district captains.
Thinking about the establishment of a private party?
I have not thought about yet because I have no time to check the past of each potential used, and did not have the money for it.
I didn't even have money for the presidential campaign; There are only 20,000 CZK on my transparent account.
Do you have any money?
You are your talking about declarations, as would be like?
I guess my personal fortune to approximately 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot of land with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and one Škodu superb, which is worth about a million. And then I have a few million in the account.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream by the way - I liked James Bond ever, as he rode in the car, was galant to women and fought simultaneously against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, has a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but you want to invest your own money not to.
This is not exactly convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Should I do about debt?
I put already 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program captures well not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign are covered basically taken by my salary as a Senator.
But the Senator salary alone, I could not live; so I could finance my son for example not the English school, the 30,000 per month cost.
If I wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing at all.
Remain so more active as an entrepreneur, to be coming out?
Not did you say that you will drive back these activities?
But that is not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially retracted my activities.
So, as my Deputy is Managing Director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live but also by something.
On which monthly income were you accustomed to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and this is still so.
I would however set my activities as President.
