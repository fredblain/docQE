A Republican strategy in order to counter the reelection of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud.
However, the latter keeps the Brennan Center for a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of fraud.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these actions undermine the democratic system in the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US-states for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced the new laws, the procedure for the registration or the election.
This phenomenon has after the elections of November 2010 in importance, in which 675 new Republican representative in 26 countries could be recorded.
As a result, 180 legislation introduced in 2011 alone, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws that require the electorate a photo ID and proof of the US-citizenship.
In addition, these laws also the time frames for the early vote shortened, the right invalid on election day, when registering voters and citizens the right to vote for a Gerichtsakte agreed.
Before the elections of 2006, no US-state of the electorate, a photo identification.
Indiana was the first state, which has such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed, this practice to extend to other countries.
Over the last two years, they fostered in 34 states of legislation, with whom the electorate a photo identification.
It is important to note that the US-citizens in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal cards such as the health card.
In fact, have 11% of US-citizens, that is to say a vocal 21 million people from a government agency issued identification of their state.
Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012, do not have such an identification card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary identification.
The new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low income disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of the afro-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years, do not have the necessary identification.
This goes further.
The students, who are seen as voters that their voice more for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed, their ID issued by their body.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or Jagdvereinen stronger for the Republican side choose cards issued by these clubs for elections to use.
In 2004, a federal state for the voting proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state that such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that the voters demand that they prove their US-citizenship.
These measures are clearly designed to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators 2011 in eight states of laws, with which the registration of voters on election day.
You also have the right of individuals and groups, to provide support to those voters who would like to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to reopen in the general election of 2004 contributed to about 10 million citizens to register.
Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the percentage of registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at the period for the early vote.
For example, in the general election of 2008 were in Florida, 33% of the voters who elected in advance, afro-Americans, although they only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the white, 76% of the electorate, only 46% of the voters who elected in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several proposals have been through the vetoes of Democratic governors blocked.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could limit the damage caused in part.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws that require the return of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012, no doubt, the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear objective of influencing the results in the crucial states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College, which are necessary in order to win the presidency.
It is too early to with certainty to confirm that these amendments to the legislation on the electoral system would have a major impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these actions undermine the democratic system in the United States.
