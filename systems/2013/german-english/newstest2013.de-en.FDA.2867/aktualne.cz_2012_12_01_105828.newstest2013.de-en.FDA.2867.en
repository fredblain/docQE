NKÚ-boss: Control of the black-system failed by politics
The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts on good monitoring bodies and adequate laws, falls in their application.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz says this is the vice president of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never completely, but it must be applied properly - and I think this is not the case with us", says Kala the current situation.
At a similar conclusion also seems to be a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative psychology, he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so called "black-system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS entrepreneurs do not bother with controls - the system is now banned or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is illegal, but not just the Regierungsvorsitzende come, and the surveillance office, whose duty is monitoring the application of the law is, in its work, is hindering" Kala.
At the meeting of the Temporary Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a common Czech-German project, in which the legislation on public contracts of both countries have been compared.
What did it mean in concrete terms?
It is a parallel test with which we have begun two years ago.
Simply put, it is that the European legislature, such as public contracts to handle are build on the national legislation, and finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and even though the examination has not yet been completed, we were extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, are the laws we perhaps even more rigorous and "perfect", the actual use, however, is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to new and more precise rules. It is also with the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? What is for you for this project?
Just such a common control could help us constantly that we cease to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if it is apparently not particularly positive.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of threshold values for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this objective.
It may even be that we, the system in this way only with excessive "paperwork burden", and those who are looking for loopholes in the system have it much easier to exploit the system, as if the thresholds higher remained.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
What the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent of NKÚ similar to the General Accounting Office, which is like us and also about a college, the only slightly different. In principle, however, both authorities are similar.
Also the competences are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, is a state that these courts of auditors in the individual federal states - this is the German system of our.
The BRH can only control what our federal government funds.
Public resources, which we of the districts and municipalities are managed under the control of Landesrechnungshöfe there.
What the German legislation, which is easier than our?
In general, I would hate to this without specifics. Nevertheless, Germany, in some respects, is often described as a role model, but certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better.
Might it have to do with the fact that the auditors are better?
This certainly not, but as I have said, I do not like such comparisons.
It is worth mentioning that, those countries which, for us, a model are also struggling.
Otherwise, they would have nothing of a collaboration with our authority, is it not?
What the Czech law, what was your authority for the revision of the Vergabegesetzes, you have any impact?
Given that this amendment is only a short time in power, it has not yet in our tests.
As our controls later, we must take place here with some delay.
Impact we feel so far in the preparatory phase of future controls - we have the new instrument "identify risks of inefficiency and" with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here are examined and analysed the impact of changes, of course, as the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of tenders were modified.
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or will the system with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption.
It may be, however, the problem is that the rules are strict "and" cannot be met.
Under the previous rules are the review unterzogenen people against the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational program of regional policy, accountable to the regional council) that any failure to comply with the Vergabegesetzes a breach of discipline.
But then, it is useful to make the law even stricter?
I do not believe in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abusing the system, and not penalise those who have committed a formal errors on the actual decision making.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say first of all that is not successful.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls of the so called "black-system" would bother - what does this mean exactly?
The black-system is now banned or permitted?
A law must have its validity, and if something is illegal, but not just the Regierungsvorsitzende come, and the surveillance office, whose duty is monitoring the application of the law is, in its activities.
He can say: "We change the law and allow the thing", but he can not say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The procurement law which owes much contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition also correct.
On the other hand, it is also a tragedy if the bidder with the best offer only due to procedural irregularities.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and this is what I believe in us.
