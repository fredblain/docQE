Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The probe Messenger has proof that it is on the planet Mercury ice.
The ice sheet is possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The US-25 NASA has the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, such as from three on Thursday in the magazine "Science" published studies have shown.
The probe Messenger have proof that there are constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet is an ice sheet.
This is to be at least 30 cm and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids, which may also on the Mercury are taken.
No one put the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the chief scientist of the Messenger-probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can measure up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help, such as water and other building blocks of life in other areas of the solar system.

Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope will 1608 by Hans Lipperhey invented before Galileo Galilei - be it a year later to the star.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes ever larger - and the insights that they provide, deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale-Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego-the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It is the same views into space on two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone is the mirror at 10.4 metres in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save money.
Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres.
The favourable design: The telescope is in his elevation angle hanging - and thus in his agility.
Also the hobby-@-@ Eberly telescope in Texas is in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: The high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is - despite relatively low 3.5m - to the world ’ s largest Spiegelteleskope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers to hear the space alien signals.
Members of the has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)" anyone can help people by computing power.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here, the Very Large Telescope - that his name.
With its four mirrors the telescope can also ausleuchten middle order.
Also on the Chilean ESO-observatory will be the European Extremely Large Telescope scheduled.
Primary should be a whopping 42 meters include - and from just under 1000 Spiegelelementen together.
With pictures, but until 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck-telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirror with an average of 10 meters.
The Keck-telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea-optical-next to them with the Subaru-Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also at the summit of Mauna Kea is a new, huge telescope - with a mirror-average of 30 metres.
Here it is on an illustration.
The main impressions from space, the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler for extrasolar planets, particularly those which are to be inhabitable.
On 2 February 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn.
In the picture are the last launch of the space telescope Kepler documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be on board a Ariane5 until 2018-rocket into space.
The primary of the Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is in light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scholars believe that at the South Pole of the Mercury ice exists.
However, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger far closer to the North Pole revolves around the planet.
For decades have Radarmessungen suggest that it is on the Mercury ice.
By the 2004-launched Messenger probe - the first, which revolves around the Mercury - have the scientists now certainty.
