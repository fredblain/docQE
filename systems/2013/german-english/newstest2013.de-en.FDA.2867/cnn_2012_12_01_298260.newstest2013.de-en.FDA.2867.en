My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are due to the lack of opportunities, forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them in hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico-City, I had just crossed the hall and was at the passport control, when perplexity in me.
Signs pointed to two queues: One for "Wochos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up and became my whole life "Mexicans called".
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians call".
Later, I opted for "Mexican-Amerikanisch."
But it was here Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for acronyms or hyphens.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough for me in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I am also not going.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about the moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House in order to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues which we expect if the heads of these two countries: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that Mexicans today, with a high probability remain in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States.
He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and a North American trade bloc in the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed that the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even if he was no details.
Mexico ’ s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasting a single thought that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem rifle, forced them to more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans in centuries and not in minutes, are reminders of this event.
Therefore, once a US-government officials also only Pit criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans afflict the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children go to Montezumas.
And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the land of opportunity, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix and San Antonio live, is that at one point in our family tree, a person may be a parent or Großelternteil - no chance in Mexico and offered immigrated in the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - folks, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may be living the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes perhaps vague, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
We are also aware that there are not many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memento of a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
Their view is our very existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, though they were not.
And then we would not now see trapped behind the Seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally in the United States had slipped, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions exist because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are, and Mexican Americans take this resent them.
While US-American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans that I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but in none of them.
In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which use their interests in the United States.
We are supposed to our American colleagues tell you how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And, in view of the unfair income distribution, rampant corruption and the drug-related violence, many of us are not so sure if it is really a great country.
I fear that you alone, Amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States to deal with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans a grudge kings, as their family members only, not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.
