The MVRDV architects show that the real adventure not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," said Lisette Verhaig, a roadside Passantin.
And Stefan Spermon, IT-technician at a nearby corporate sector, says: "But, well, it is already, the house."
However, I wonder why we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and E-Books.
No one is still voluntarily in one of these old-style-libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt before the gates of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitants-community has the lowest education rates throughout the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and the seven fictitious bridges on the frontloading are portrayed as a pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the Marshall.
And so, the dominant that there is only one way, the statistics: A library to that!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam architects MVRDV, Master of the heroic Balkendiagramme and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with the same composure and appeared on the competition-hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a big smile on his face.
And while the jury is still looked perplexed and top with the armpits wincing, the cheeky Maas his exquisite souvenir of a pyramid and finished his actionist based speech with the words: "Love municipality!"
This is it, then, my proposal for the Bücherberg from Spijkenisse, for the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million built expensive mountain.
He is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts to the underground car park, supermarkets, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte that to date no longer had to offer as a postmodern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly Town Hall, whose white facades behind a Molkereifabrik would be inclined to suspect, a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, has now Spijkenisse on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass.
There is a lift, in the middle of the mountain massif, but the real space and rage (Lesefreuden when climbing the topography.
The completely glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned Klinkerboden unequivocally and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
We are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And all books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, of the most uncomfortable and impersonal is", says Winy Maas.
We have the classic Raumkonfiguration upside down and the reading area from the inside to the outside this House.
The interior of the Bücherbergs is shrewdly: In the middle are offices, Internet-library, Schachclub, environment centre and Haustechnikzentrale.
A particular pleasure are the black bookshelves, the times wall panels, sometimes parapet, sometimes Stiegengeländer.
Look, feel and smell are strange.
Even a architects and building engineers whether unknown Baustoffs shake of the head.
"We wanted to work with recycling-materials," said Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen Agricola one day on a waste product from agriculture.
For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields as Wurzelunterlage millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile holds a, two seasons, then it is ripe for the bottels.
For the library was the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates.
Under Hitzeeinwirkung and pressure, the socalled Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that was a little after new cars and a little after tennis shoe.
After 105 steps you are arrived at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long wanderings in Literaturcafé will not only with a fantastic view over the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen rewarded.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in Literaturgebirge.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe but this House, in spite of the many glass is a flagship project in terms of the environment," says Trouborst.
Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz, the sun is shining even on sunny days just inside.
The broad lumber to serve as shading glass facade, and a large proportion of sunlight.
The climate is very pleasant.
The rest fully automated blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT-industry, already ventured into the new library.
Also, Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher, Cynthia Bogarde Boekenberg even Spijkenisses "long overdue soul".
The reason: The opening a few weeks ago, each residents invited to a book from his personal collection.
That is for the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 piece - be filled.
The concept is.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty Library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation has now all inhabitants of a certain kind of relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
That is the pinnacle of the MVRDV those who, in the jargon identity.
Literary history Spijkenisse has written.
So young and uneducated they may be.
That is a starting point for identity.
