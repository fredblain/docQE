The test: Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung should be made or not?
The PSA test-wise, in fact, sometimes incorrect results on, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater reluctance of the already undecided men for the implementation of screening.
The test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two medical specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in mortality in patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that a follow-up after 12 years of the likelihood of the formation of metastases of 30 to 40% higher, if no screening was performed.
I would therefore advise the test from the age of 50 years and 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
In men, afro-American origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was detected.
There are cancers, the aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient must be the magnitude of the risk of his cancer really made clear he demonstrated by the possible options for which there will remain untouched, if he can the quality of life in the long term, and you are not affected in these cases for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, in which cancer has detected no treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and not a threat to her life.
It proposes an active surveillance and offers them in a progression of the disease treatment.
It certainly with increasing accuracy the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not.
I therefore commend the implementation of the tests.
However, the most important thing is to speak with their doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the International Society for Movember Urology has developed an instrument with which it is possible to the pros and cons of the PSA-tests to assess.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no panacea for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the field of research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of contracting him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer cases could be avoided if all eat well and would move.
"If there were no smokers, this value would be at least a 50% increase," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unresolved.
For the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, in spite of the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It harms the health of the people.
"Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem the risk for breast, Grimmdarm-, Mastdarm-, for cancer of the oesophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that a regular physical activity during the entire life protects against Grimmdarmkrebs," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends eating red meat.
In a lot of it increases the risk of contracting a Grimm- or cancer.
Salami should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the cells and the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists the link between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer.
But now their research is not conclusive.
After the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft are the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
While a study to reduce the risk of prostate cancer discovered, showed a different rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has also not yet.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is, with his doctor about its concerns and his family drawn to speak.
"The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not reduce cancer."
