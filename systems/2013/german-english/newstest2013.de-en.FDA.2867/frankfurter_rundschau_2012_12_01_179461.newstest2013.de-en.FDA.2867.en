One-two-three-four.
Only then the voices of the singer slowly - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano, harass and persecute, trick.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year anniversary conductor, it almost from its Stoffschuhen if it with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg Imbongi the choir rehearsing a new song.
