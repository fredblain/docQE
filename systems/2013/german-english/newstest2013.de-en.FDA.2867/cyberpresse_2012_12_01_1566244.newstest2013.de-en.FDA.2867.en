The Higgs-which analysed
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs-Bosons last summer has a certain sensation, and for good reason.
It is, in fact, that this which about nothing less than the mechanism is involved, for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
Lastly, it is the last particle whose existence from the Standard Model - our best or "least wrong" statement of nature and the behaviour of matter - predicted, but has not been empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it is still not entirely sure that this really the Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a genuine new particles, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs-like which.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data in this week on a major physics-Congress were presented in Kyoto, but it still lacks data, in order to be completely safe.
We are still working on the assumption that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we take a look at what we are talking about.
There are in this world a necessarily unmissable law that causes two objects in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to breach the - and try it not too strong, since you are hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they also such a law applies: The Pauli 's Ausschlussprinzip which says that two particles are not the same room at the same time to fill in the same "when they are", the "condition" broadly from some of its properties.
On this basis, the physicist share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who politely be described as Fermione and obey the Pauli-principle.
And in the other the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that they are, in fact, at the same time, at the same place.
These bosons are organized according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: They will handle the here we are not "and the" Kraftteilchen, through which the great forces of nature, with which the Higgs-related which would somehow.
It must be emphasised, however, that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it was only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The photon or the "some" that the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field precisely in this place, "disrupted" in about like a pebble, who was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "bearers of the force."
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs-which, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs-field, "" must be disturbed, so that this which shows.
However, the Higgs field-much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogens must reach very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks Rocky.
That is why a giant particle accelerator, such as the CERN needed - of the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to achieve these energies.
The analogy of the electromagnetic field is helpful to the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, are doing this, but others do not, for example, would never have a piece of paper from the fridge.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs-field: Those who do it, have a mass, while the other (as the photon) have no mass.
For what all these research "can now be good," Mrs Plamondon?
For science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists, all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM to investigate.
There are also many physicists who truly hope that such deviations are found, since the slightest difference a door to a "new physics" open and some holes of the model could fill.
It must be said that the latter has serious shortcomings, as there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, the CERN such deviations until now not found.
Consequences
The effects of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
By the way: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories not suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser in the 1960s was invented in 1962, and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) - has already said that the laser at the beginning rather than a "Laborspielerei was seen".
Imagine...
Applications can also result from all of the instruments, the research.
For example, in turn Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the optics a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose of this sensor is today all digital cameras globally as "eye" in 2009 and has him the Nobel Prize in physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
