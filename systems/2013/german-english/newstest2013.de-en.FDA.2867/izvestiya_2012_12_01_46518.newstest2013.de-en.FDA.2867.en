"The brain is so far only moderately outsmart"
The supporters of modern technology popular subject of the enlarged reality in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first presented at its annual conference in the summer a working model, in November was then known, that Microsoft had a proper patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D-technologies in the Microsoft-laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only an almost.
It excites the possibility, virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and virtual spaces.
- please describe in your group, which operates research.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, the world largely stuck in the phase in which worked with pixels on flat screens will also be affected, sometimes.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and the radical changes foresee this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console-and-sensors: A step forward, and Xbox will no longer be sold without full glory here, since all for motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- While: The interaction on a physical level, is much more on the flat, sometimes in 3D.
The entry of information (the system more data) could be improved, the issue has still not essential.
We are trying to change that, are working on real 3D Darstellungssystemen on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We must make the computer world in our physical world they sacked and intelligible.
It is, however, important that not only the users, but also its surroundings.
We could then the real world is a lot easier through virtual objects.
And first and foremost we should these silly virtual-reality-helmets los!
- What do you think about meeting?
It is popular, but it will not be overrated?
- You is certainly not the solution which can solve all the problems, because it raises questions about privacy, because they are not always all paper information about his actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers, however, each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of the management of objects on public squares on a project in which we with short, succinct, rather than with sweeping gestures.
The gestures, but not from the Objektkamera recorded by a bracelet that the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
It is still a relatively large, could in theory, however, reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, all in all, however, is the future, for example, mixed Steuerungstypen gestures and language.
- How it?
- We would like to ask you, for example, to these Sprudeldose?
They say it, and hints at the same time.
Normally I say it simply.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- Heißt that you want the user to a machine that can provide at any given time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we in the next time, especially in the development of new types of work must be that allow reactions from people in more detail.
The laser scanners, for instance, can be in depth, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
- Which claims put on the basis of your work with the Xbox :-sensors on modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of 3D detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
In this sense, all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms more work.
It is not only the resolution along the X and the part, but also along the Z-axis are taken into account.
The speed and the number of frames per second is important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and to be honest, the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a Berührungssensor with an adjustable Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with the current commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed just a device, only without Berührungssteuerung and with more frames per second.
- the number of cameras, should not be increased?
- is currently working with three: "Camera", with one of them actually a and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-camera.
It is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe.
More cameras could solve the problem...
Or the problem would be necessary, as more calculations.
Beautiful would be: A flexible ,-similar system, in which we could play with different Kameraneigungen, to see how this in the 3D identifying a position helps.
- if I remember rightly, Google, Microsoft, in contrast to his glasses, not the public.
Do you not think that, with regard to the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens has the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant, always a smartphone in the hand, but I think this: The neatest variant would be a "changing" enhanced reality, when we have a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone could switch
The lens is a personal gadget and is its strength (private can only you can see), but also their weakness, for an enlarged reality through glasses that you may share with others to work in virtual objects.
- positions us for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air, not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but he is also available.
There is a problem on the critics often this idea: There are no tangible reaction.
The hands feel nothing at all!
The responses to this objection to your group?
- In my lectures I speak from the reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of second hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.
She takes pressure is true!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed the "images in the air" to give something Handfestes, for example, the interference of some Ultraschallstrahlen directed at a certain point where the finger, a sense that at the moment is so weak, but as pustete someone over the knuckles.
There are also bands for the wrist on the nerve endings detect tissue injury in the fingers, this is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outwit the brain?
We think that it can feel what it would feel if it is just a little?
- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried it.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, namely a people who are physically in an enclosed space, to believe that he is instead, in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gym), movable platforms and large balls.
So far it is only moderately outwit the brain and we still have many busy years.
It is precisely that which makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so attractive: On many issues, we are only at the beginning.
