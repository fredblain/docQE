The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo, the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as the basis is controversial.
Egyptian President saved not with pathos.
We must make the transition.
"And that it is successful, is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to all the people and, above all, probably to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened and secular Muslims.
For all of them, have been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile from graces the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said nearly entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the competences of the constitutional court temporarily curtailed and his powers, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year old engineer, a PhD from the University of Southern California, really out to save, as the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear.
Should the judicial process?
Indeed, the 234 items from the Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly 100 köpfigen because in a nightly, 15-hour walkouts Parforceritt were rushed through, some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also means it in the draft, the jurisdiction based upon the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists the woolly formulation and the attendant legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least a newly hinzugeführter article: In all the issues relating to the sharia should consult Al-Ashar-University, the country ’ s main Islamic institution with great power in the whole of Sunni Islam.
It must not, but it may mean that the clergy, which oversees the legislation is de facto the disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much in Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian jurisdiction should continue to be preserved.
These dishes served during Mubarak ’ s rule to the repression of political opponents.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in Militärhaft.
Governments should also, as stated in the draft, "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "protect their morals and promote its values."
This is legally formulated so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even the contents of cinema and literature to control.
In plain language, this means nothing other than censorship.
Not incidentally, writes articles explicitly equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy to insult or to slander.
But what an insult is and how it is to be punished, remains unclear.
The wording is also dubious, "insulting people" should be banned.
Is there has been a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of Leader?
Open to interpretation, as so much in the draft, the Morsi to signature and after his words "very soon" the Egyptians to the referendum will be presented.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the excessive power of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual concord on Friday evening at the-Tahrir Square in Cairo, and vowed to bring down the Charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and ex-head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said, "the draft Constitution belong on the scrapheap of history."
He accused Via Kurznachrichtendienst Twitter followers Morsi ’ s, a "coup against democracy" to lead.
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and unseat him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren has not yet been atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several justices said that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well organised Muslim Brotherhood blew the counter-demonstration, for its part, as a precaution but not on the Tahrir-place, but after a Massengebet on the other - before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafisten attended and called: "The people of calls for the application of God ’ s law."
They demanded that Morsi Säubere: "The country!" And my: "The Koran is our constitution."
A battle for control of the symbolic-Tahrir Square, where it all began, could have led to French.
This was clearly not risk Morsi supporters.
The Brothers said that both the opponents of the draft as well as the advocates had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time, the people at the ballot box, to decide the direction in which the country should go.
A majority in favour of the draft Islamists is considered safe.
"The word rights, not even before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process that could have gone to the February and all the social forces should include.
The 48-year old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood under Mubarak, as they are in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their philosophy, but because of him, human rights are indivisible.
For this, he was beaten, imprisoned.
"And now, the word rights, not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world" on Sunday.
Morsi Machtausweitung on all three powers in the state of the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of play and Egypt in a new dictatorship.
"Instead of civil society, the President to strengthen them de facto suspended Saeda," complains.
But a democracy without civil society organisations could not work.
Saeda feels abandoned, also of the international community, which the ideological Richtungskampf on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This might take revenge.
A demonstrator at the Tahrir warns: "Their gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."
