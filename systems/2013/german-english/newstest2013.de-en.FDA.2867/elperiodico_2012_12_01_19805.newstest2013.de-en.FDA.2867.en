What is privately for anyone under 16 years?
How will this definition to its everyday life and the social networks?
He understands the dangers to which he exposes the Internet situations, when he announced that he does not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years, often in the network.
In four of the cases linked it with the word "something very own" and "on a personal level on the password and user" if they apply it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets in a post I would not provide" says the 10 years old Jorge in an attempt to the importance of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger to explain where he accounts for two years.
"These are very sensitive secrets, my mother must know it, but not the whole world," he acknowledged.
On FB I invite beautiful pictures or photos of games.
I think my time with friends.
"I would not a photo sharing, which is not of me, or from someone of the stupid," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong, obscene photographs of naked, of crimes, or insulting or violent comments to write.
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he and nine Folger in FB has in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother, the password to one of the accounts.
Me, I reported on Twitter to express myself and interesting tweets to write.
"I do not know if someone, I invite you to only high," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can quickly with relatives in the distance, or with friends talk" is he.
He asked replies that he never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone empfähle a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year anniversary José is different.
The teenager, user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he gives to the people, not to know that he has added his friends list.
"It scares me, not because we have something in common, for example, music", he gives.
After the boy has given him no one hints or him after his address or phone number.
"They harassed me or if someone asks me, do I remove him from my account is simply," he said.
José got in contact with Ask, after he had read in Twitter a recommendation.
The boys are not unknown experience, which is now called Cyberbullying.
The friend of a friend was in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.

"He has only privately."
Then he explained a series of steps to create a user account sure to configure.
Unlike Jorge would this boy photos of friends upload in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do if he is unsympathetic to me or him one wants to dust.
"But I know that this Cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was conceived as a medium for the search for information; with the release of these pages, but the rules have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academics Marc Prensky, owner of a Master-title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "digital natives and Immigrants" these words of explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they are, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them that we still get themselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we demand that they have a defined criteria, distributed, published or can be said, and this in an age where the maturity of this is not enough."
"They should also be fussy when it is most important to them, to be liked, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which privacy is, to ask them questions that it.
"To tell you, they should do not, does not work", he says.
Porras then mentions a number of options: There are things that you would not tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, if you like, if you published a photo of you, as you have published by a friend?
Do you know what the other about you?
Do you have the other people asked for permission before, if you have photos of celebrations labelled?
And one more question: What you need to know, do in any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply for the social networks," he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultant, says that it is essential that the parents of the directives of the social networks carefully.
If they all sections understand they have solid foundations, with their children about the importance of Eröffnens one user on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you must share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, the children of the lesson "Thou shalt not speak with strangers."
