"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Member of Parliament and civil rights activist, discuss what use the law on binding language tests for migrants are criminals, with fake certificates
Each year, 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to raise money for the maintenance of the remaining families in the country.
On 1 December, a law in force, according to which everyone working immigrant a test of knowledge of Russian language must be certified.
So far, these regulations apply only for migrants in the services sector, in the municipal housing and retail to work.
The tests, however, with time, according to FÃ¶deraler permits for all guest workers on duty in the future.
In this regard, we must not only language tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Skills must be both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit will be shown.
Exemptions are only valid for citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also exempt from this legislation are people who their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense and protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the very sophisticated, under the aegis of the Pushkin-Institute for the Russian language, with the Russian University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can give the tests in all cities; already in Russia were already more than 160 centres.
The initiative to introduce the tests, the deputies of the State Duma and Federal permits.
Human rights activist, on the other hand, before the entry into force of the law on several occasions in the press the following question: What does it actually mean?
What changes does the requirement to show, language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, say, spokesman for the permits, to reduce the number of forced labour.
"Many are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representation of the Federal permits in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected even before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language inevitably people with bad intentions will meet him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he stuck with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents endure and 12 to 14 hours a day working.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home will give you the One promised, and on arrival, you will get confiscated their passports, and receive not the promised reward," the head of the headquarters for migration of Tajik, Tolib Schwaripow permits.
Not, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money, not only because they do not speak the language of the country, but also in their own language hardly in writing to express themselves.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, so much as the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can only afford a sensible primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money, for the children, let alone to feed them decent clothes, shoes and and to buy.
As a teenager, these children then take the first opportunity for making money.
"It is difficult, without language skills," she said.
"You still feel humiliated and inferior."
Human rights activists say the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, so there is no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of illegal migrant workers in Russia.
"Welcome" or "banned" unauthorized access
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy in Russia, an official status.
The reason, bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic problems.
It costs the legalisation of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration, you can quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents largely fabricated and we are not registered, and it then cases of extortion.
"They want to one or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea", the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow told journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers"
Already on the day on which the law in force, it turned out that not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates that the completion of the language tests certify, have already been of employees of the Federal beschlaggenommen permits.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners this not in vain: Every migrant who hoped to spare as the tests to be paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: This costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
About the fact that the main immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, not just so that the certificates can be purchased, are both officials and human rights activists agreed.
For the moment, the authorities of immigrant workers, which for the first time by the fall, only promise that it is time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
In addition, new arrivals without language offered jobs in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
