Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotters, Héctor "the Hetin" Reyes, was the Korbsport for more than 60 years, and has travelled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of each of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was killed by a stroke in 2008 was confined to a wheelchair, was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, whether it be as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, agent and head in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketballverbands.
"My life I have many hats in basketball, even more at the same time, President of the BSN, CEO and President of the Association of the national team in the 1990s was", remembered Reyes on a visit from Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he met Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement is not.
The walls of his house, almost all with photos and memories of his long career decorated and they testify.
In the heart of Bayamón
The emotionalsten memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as a player to 1982, where he remembered his 15-anniversary as fireworks Mitgeschäftsführer or managing director of the clubs.
"Those were my best years I have enjoyed most because I part of eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967 as Managing Director, whether it be Mitgeschäftsführer or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was "a very good manager, says Reyes.
I remember that I am Gene Bartow, who worked as a trainer and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.
Do you want to him? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
Recommended the Bartow Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, and made one of our best shooter was.
I remember, as he said that if Mincy a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another.
The championship with the Vaqueros Gausse grants, but he was from a distance, because he is already out in 1988 at the top of the Association.
At that time, he pulled his executions by Mincy and in the national team.
I remember when we vorolympischen tournament for the first time in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, bronze should have been, if not this Canadian judge would have been the last move us again, for the second time, said Reyes.
This group of the World Cup in 1990, was the best national team which thou hast ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those that during the Olympic Games in 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite, but the team of Free Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we gold and the team of the United States won a battle, as when they against us in the world championship bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Don Quixote" Morales, the 1990 because of a knee injury not able to be present.
A team that perhaps in terms of personalities is not the best, but we won a gold medal and a great pleasure for us was that of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the suspended players because of the events in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, against all forecast won the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico, at this level, so how Piculín dominated.
And this, without his career in different leagues, where he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We have had a number of good coach as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the best that you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of national team from 1988 to 1995, which the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What can you do?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The guys in Ponce, for example, only in their territory and play only in the national breaks on crews from other corners of the island.
Today, the children of unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I can see the outcome of the compulsory education and courses for coaches and referees, table-officials.
I am proud of that.
What do you do today?
I listen to music, watch videos of music my time in YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time I go to a studios.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
