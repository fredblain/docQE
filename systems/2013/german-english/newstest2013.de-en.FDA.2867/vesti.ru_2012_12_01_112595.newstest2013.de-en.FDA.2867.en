Birth in space
Planet in peril.
Global warming or collision with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Erdbewohnern on board are on the search for a Ersatzplaneten.
In order to save humanity in the future, the important question of how we in the weightlessness or on the Ersatzplaneten breed?
Many choices, there is, in my opinion, not.
In fact, there are only two genuine planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Even Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff at the Astronomical Institute include-Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars, is comparatively build enjoyable on the surface of Venus a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, therefore, possible in space.
The question of reproduction in space, the researchers first treated with regard to the flora.
Already, half a century before that were carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the Orbit planted peas differed not at all of the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, specifically from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs sent into space to explore how the weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It promotes a normal chicks.
But then the problem.
"The problem is that the chicks have to find; it must stop on his legs and can start to move", explains the laboratory officials of the Institute for medically-biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground, the chicks wild.
Ten hours later the instincts of a newborn stumpften completely.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
They then died four days later.
"We chicks hatch twice and the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychew for failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last Brutk√§fig flew with animals 16 years in orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments continued.
However, on the Biosatelliten Bion "only" homosexual species.
There was an experiment with rats, which already fertilized were sent into space.
In principle, there was nothing special.
"That was just with the Biosatelliten again, but it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the Weltraumratten children.
The issue of reproduction directly in space so you could not solve.
The task is difficult.
Animals in their natural habitat, can easily be taken out their Fortpflanzungstrieb not follow.
In contrast to animals could be the man that in principle.
Homo sapiens is able to abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
Yet women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk, there was at Tereshkova.
The most precious that humanity has, is the female body.
Our gull flew, and no one on the planet can answer the following question: Would have survived the most?
After the flight, they bring a child into the world.
"Finally, no one answered that question," says Raumfahrtveteran's Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their most intimate, gave birth to the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, was also concerning Andrijan militiamen.
In 1988, the second woman gave birth in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja twice in orbit was disinfected and even work outside of one, a son.
Nevertheless, there is a risk.
We have very few Cosmonaut, in which, after long flights all went well and they were healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, the human race for new paths in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in Vorbereitungszentrum the Cosmonaut is a compulsory Station during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of flux win the Cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a strange environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander having life on the country rose from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it will be easier for water to get used to.
In principle, this is logical, as from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, so the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness makes the stomach and extremely fast Beckenmuskulatur back and, therefore, the ability to meet the child.
Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
For example, the birth could also take place in a Spezialkammer to the child.
"But what happens then?", is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand the child also artificial gravity.
Without the gravitational to feel the organism is the skeleton and the muscles do not.
A newborn child is not as an adult in orbit for training in a Belastungsanzug.
He is simply the missing in his life, which is of fundamental importance.
"This experiment, which we have in common, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will mean that we have a disabled, a completely non-conformist will bring people to the world," says the head of the Bioethikkommission of the Institute for medically-biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space mere theory.
At some point, but reality, if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space.
