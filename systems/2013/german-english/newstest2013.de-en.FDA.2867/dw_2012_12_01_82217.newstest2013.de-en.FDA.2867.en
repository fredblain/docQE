Szabo: "German must play a greater role"
Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin balanced on a narrow diplomatic degrees.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it against the request for an observer of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But abstained from Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have done, not.
Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But, at the same time, I believe that it is not the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to set up a no fly zone.
This was finally by NATO.
It is hard, Germany in important international issues to adopt a clear position?
Yes, that is true.
The reason is that surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States, so to speak, to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are so between the fronts.
One expects of them that they play a more independent role, because they are not accustomed to.
I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to national interests and positions that are independent of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany ’ s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike that of the other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It should therefore be careful, the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, not to offend the.
In any case, the plays a role.
But I would not want too much weight to, this is not a totally biased relationship.
In any case, but it plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has its relations with the United States, damaged by the important decisions, such as abstained in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that, in Europe, and even in the US, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this is such a dramatic break was, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany is so that even a certain respect.
But because it signalled that it be taken seriously as an international player and his interests should be considered.
In Europe there are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, have been clear for a veto.
There are differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly probably pretty much sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, can the government publicly not, of course, this position.
I believe that the actual differences are not so great as they always have.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so audience of Netanyahu ’ s policies.
It is Germany hard, its close relations with Israel and the United States on one, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
This would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can not part of a wider line and must instead be things from their own position.
They just do this with the euro.
I believe that in future, Germany, a leading role in Europe to a European position.
That is, of course, not just for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I believe that the German, it is clear that they have a more independent role to play.
Faces Germany itself in the role as a major global player - wants Germany to take a leading role at all?
Or is the lead Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not accustomed to the is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to land a major role to play.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time that Germany will be a greater role, various anti-German feelings.
This makes it the Germans not easy.
This is, in fact, the old problem: You want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this perspective, Germany in a far worse position than the US.
There must be susceptible to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, the EU has filled the vacuum at the moment but not, who is otherwise?
The Germans are simply need to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like them, it is unpleasant and they still have a lot of unpopular, c 'est la vie!
