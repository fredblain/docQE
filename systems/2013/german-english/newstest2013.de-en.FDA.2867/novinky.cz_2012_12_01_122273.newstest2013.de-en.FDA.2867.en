"The people want the Republic save, but I am just an amateur Okamura," said.
Mr Senator, how do you get to the idea, to seek the presidency?
I am not seeking to Senator or to be president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would be nowhere.
But I can no longer see the republic for 20 years, as thieves plundered roam free, while the people of the taxes and increasing the retirement age.
I had no ambitions, politicians.
When I see something, but what I do not like it, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And because I have more than 40 am, and independent and cultural heritage, and I have no other choice than to change things for senator or the president to stand.
In the Senate, you have managed and then straight on the road to the castle.
Return the back not your voters?
I have said all the time that the battle for the castle to the outcome of the senatorial elections.
Later, I have this clarified and I said that I was a candidate for the office of the president, if I am elected a senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realise my vision.
But I was as much influence and a strong mandate.
The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television, but starting, which wants to make a difference.
The media, which want to steal the honour, and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
About me was, for example, claimed that I would journalists bribe or that I consultant by Jiří Paroubek was.
We are talking about your visions.
The fight for the castle, you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a citizen, I have campaigned for the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the quarrelsome policy - when someone from the right or from the left with a good proposal is rejected, it is deliberately, and that keeps the population only.
As an independent Parteiloser I have a far greater potential, support for all the parties represented in the parliament.
My advantage is that I am without Schubladendenken Parteidogmen of each party and the, which is the best for our country.
Watch as a person in the policy more right or left?
From Czech view seems to me that I am rather see the people on the left.
For me, this right-thinking-links but totally irrelevant.
For me, important that we can make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone to the left or to the right; I want the people.
Always, I support publicly any good approach, even if this from the sides or of the ODS, and equally I will turn against bad ideas.
It bothers you, if someone you as populists.
But this does not make you confirm what you have just said.
If you are a business plan in a company, then you have also a Idealziel and a vision.
And this would you approach.
You can not describe it as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world, or they were of important experts.
Without support in Parliament, but you still have only keywords.
And this brings you in the long term in politics.
Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk to the people, for example, will manage the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to persuade them to get on our side to these targets.
As president, it would be not a problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties to live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to legislate.
And the addressee may then have to say why they refuse.
A strong personality, which points to grievances, can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the President, which is a credit to the public pressure.
I would like to make it quite clear that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius or an intellectual.
I try to allies for my views and vision.
With the policy, I have only just started, for my programme and the support of the majority.
I always try to assess things themselves; and if it does not work, then I am in six years in the private sector.
It sounds a little as if Okamura the Czech Republic should save.
I am not a savior.
I know that I alone, and that is why I have nothing do with several celebrities wondered whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with Radim Jančura, however, refused to work.
In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, the fraud in trade with light fuel oil.
I began my candidacy with the condition that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not more secure.
Sixty percent of voters are left to the elections, and those who have gone to the elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are so that only two Independent.
The people have chosen such a Senatszusammensetzung that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner.
Do you think about the creation of a separate party?
I have not thought about it, because I have no time in the past to check each potential Parteimitglieds, and does not have the money.
I still have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
They have no money?
You talk about Vermögenserklärungen, what would your?
My personal wealth I value to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I had a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a superb Škodu, about a million is worth. And then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was a dream - James Bond has always liked me, as in the car he was driving was galant to women and, at the same time, against evil.
They drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money, you do not want to invest in it.
This is not particularly convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Shall I make about debt?
I have already 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is probably not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign are, in fact, covered by my salary as a senator.
But the Senatorengehalt alone I could not live; so I could not, for example, my son, the English school finance the 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
You will therefore continue to work as entrepreneurs to have your livelihood?
You said that you go back these activities?
But that does not depend on the amount of salary.
As promised, I have in my activities.
Thus, for example, my deputy managing director of travel agencies in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan, of the republic.
But I have to live but also of something.
To which you were accustomed to such as entrepreneurs?
Some 200,000 to 400,000, and this is still the case.
As President, I would, however, all my endeavors.
The complete conversation can be found in the period of Právo.
