A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which granted him temporarily unlimited authority remains divided, more than ever, it decided to go for broke.
To the surprise of all he has on Wednesday announced that the Constituent Assembly the next day adopt its final version.
Just over a week the head of state this House had two additional months for the conclusion of his works.
Egypt is now for almost two years on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only for even greater division of the country.
For his opponents remains the president in his "autocratic delirium", as he continues to be "word" and "the right underfoot".
On the part of his supporters assures you that there is a way of the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the process of transition.
Within 14 days if a referendum to be held.
A very short period, the brothers forces on their projects, the Egyptians to the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, during the protest has been raging throughout the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote is an ultimatum: "Either you or I keep my draft the unlimited authority", the latter should be after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly an end.
85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in the middle of November, they were turned away because they feel that they have not been able to their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or the civil society have equally.
To reach the quorum yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members, added.
Some are very close to the Moslembrüdern.
It is not surprising that most of the items were adopted unanimously.
Incidentally, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of the day... in time for prayer reflected, as some members of the committee took the view that the clock of the constituent assembly was not exactly.
The text that has been adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, of all the attention, after all, was identical to that of the 1971 constitution and says that "the principles of sharia is the main source of the law".
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law, had an important requirement is the hope that "the principles" by "to replace the rules", which is a more stringent application of possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the liberals who say this only as Propagandaschlag.
For them, the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
They have in mind, particularly Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, particularly in relation to the review of the compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, as "the people who are asked to an opinion, are not elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals will also be nourished by the fact that the next Rector of the University of far less moderate than the present.
"There is no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, "Alexis appeased Blouet, a PhD on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.
But, he concedes that "in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity may be available, because the terms used are borrowed the religious vocabulary.
It relates in particular to the "Islamic jurisprudence Fiqh" [i.e.].
And in the future could be raised the question of the extent to which Zivilrichter are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted much yesterday because of the extensive powers, which he criticised the President of the Republic.
The Moslembrüder argue that this compared with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another bone of contention: The powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget, but not before a national NDC.
Likewise, there is no ban on civil give in military courts, as the human rights organisations demanded.
The latter also share their fears with regard to the text with which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, and serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression could have, in particular for the press.
Furthermore, no article refers more to the protection of women underscores Morayef, 2006 by Human Rights Watch.
In its opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President last night on television saying something, are demonstrations planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the Head of State teeming with are Saturday.
