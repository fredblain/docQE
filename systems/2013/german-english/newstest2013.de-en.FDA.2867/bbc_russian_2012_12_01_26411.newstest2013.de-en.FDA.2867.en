"There is a separate, sometimes artisanal production as well as a mafia, the smuggling organized", explains the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated how much of each of the five channels on the supply of the black market in illegal arms around.
In 2011, a report from the Center for Problemanalysen and state administration.

A technician of Waffenladens, who did not want to be named, assured that weapons, which are found in illegal excavations, nobody buys for a long time, since they are outdated.
According to him, it is more likely that traders in the supply depots.
Over an ensign will be a weapon, for example a gun type TT, bought.
The weapon will be issued and through the fence.
"The retailer brings the weapon in the city and sold them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know everything, of course, and that is why, if they plan to detecting crime cannot fulfil periodically Kontrollkäufe dealers offer by illegal weapons," adds the technician.
"As in" Luxusladen
Buyers and sellers are most common on friends to each other.

There are traders in the markets, but there you must go and discuss with a code of such as "War, the building that the daughter has lost a tooth."
