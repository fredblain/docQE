In Colorado, there is no clear guidance for the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-year old community college-student and footballer Anthony Orozco is in southeast Colorado on trial for a crime in this state, which soon will be legally: The possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a pipe with which he smoked.
Orozco said he and some friends were in it with a car in Lamar, close to the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officers had found marijuana in the car, Orozco for possession of drugs and summoned Drogenutensilien - excusable, each with a fine of 100 US-dollar are provided, and received a court hearing.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco.
But he is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities to legalise marijuana for personal use, is the answer in hundreds of smaller takes less than the law on location.
Hundreds of offences, which are to be marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, who dropped similar measures that have already been approved.
The police authorities are pursuing adults over 21 years ago no longer for possession in a small extent. This is legally allowed, as soon as the new laws in the weeks to come into force.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced, existing Marihuanadelikte and quote still people in court.
At the same time, several cities, to vote in favour of the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains about new, state licensed Marihuanageschäfte at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so rapidly that I do not even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. (, police chief in Aurora, the east of Denver.
And regulatory authorities in the state of Washington scratch themselves perplexed at the head.
They are waiting for a guide to establish a licensing systems for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of December 1, 2013.
In Washington, it is of the opinion that Colorado in any case is ahead of the majority of States, which concerns the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only for medical purposes and then to the Eigenkonsum legalised.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore right to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith is there to that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent, which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, on 6 December in force and the conclusion of a grey area, in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be resolved in this time, about how the government target of a "fair access to" which marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.
"There will be no more difficult, a site for a licensed Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the area of Seattle", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief (his staff in Aurora a E-Mail, in which he said that the prosecutor would smaller Marihuanadelikte in people over 21 years ago no longer, and that the police are now "no" to get for this offence.
Chief (added that the police continue to urban targets for regulation of growers of medical marijuana will continue to enforce and drug traffickers.
In WELD County in northern Colorado Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly to consumers for withdrawing.
Currently, 119 people for the possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana on trial, although many also for other offences were charged.
"Our agency has the duty to prosecute offences, which are to Tatzeitpunkt crimes was," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions, even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana-initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest town of the district, shows adults for the possession of small amounts of no longer.
Pete Bezirksstaatsanwalt Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to abandon all outstanding Besitzverfahren.
"I do not believe that I don ’ t waste my time to enforce the law, until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado, supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions in the whole state under local officials encouraged a profound dichotomy in relation to the big green experiment.
At Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it were a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver to Marihuanadelikte represents the defendants in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the national organisation on the reform of Marihuanagesetzen.
"They have such a large part of their lives spent to prosecute people for the legalization still cannot accept", he believes.
The first states that small amounts of marijuana, such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national test-cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to an era of legal sales, they also prepare waiting nervously on orders of the federal government, which the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level remains a criminal offence.
Advocates of the Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the justice ministry will give in.
Despite several spectacular arrests of consumer and medical marijuana sellers of the Federal Government has launched the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drugs policy-adviser of the Obama-government believes that investigators are probably no doors in order to seize small quantities of drugs, but are likely to resist under the new legislation legal, regulated marijuana-shops to tolerate.
Several cities in Colorado are not even that the federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana-shops, although this only open in about a year.
Montrose decided last week, a city in the West, a six-month ban, the likely next week.
"We do not want to end up in a position in which we license and then someone at the federal level have a huge problem", as Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
Our community has voted against this change in the law.
We then, for what the municipality decided and not afterwards, for which the state.
Still, many questions unanswered.
