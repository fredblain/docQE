Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be unexpected cornerstone for peace
Is it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual apportioning blame, countless buildings to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza, near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians trapped in their historical conflict, is changing the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this mayhem.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate may find their end.
A war that is not yet lost
At first blush, optimism, given the current situation is not appropriate.
Even if the on 21 November have agreed ceasefire continues, this fighting the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, although his group even large losses.
Although several Hamas-leader killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel until now has not managed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, that of the rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah is controlled.
And the Hamas-leader could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world has grown in influence Hamas have powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power that once was seen as Israel ’ s closest Muslim ally, has taken to the Hamas party - just as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubelnde Hamas-followers believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren characteristics before the Stürzung Bashar Assad could be up to Jordan, where Hamas-allies the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, the single Germany's most densely populated districts and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years, only had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders more verschwägert Volksansichten.
In future diplomatic negotiations could be Hamas as a player, even from Israel and the United States can not excluded.
Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no more.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome", has been able to test and many of the Hamas-missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel is a quiet sleep.
Diplomatic believe the United States unshaken by its position, many European countries have Hamas blamed for the latest escalation.
Israel is there in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.
Although rockets from the Gaza strip-since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, the country is still relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the control in the West Bank, and thus in the body of any Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements, which is in breach of international law, but always have been declared to be developed further.
Netanyahu is well-. His Likud Party, ahead of the elections on January 22, under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren group.
Why this cunning Palestinians nanny and leave them to their own state?
If they actually have control over the West Bank, would it not just as their supporters also fire rockets in Gaza?
No, it is better that they are behind the wall at bay and punish, should they dare to raise the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners. However, the Arab Spring could thwart them.
Even if the Islamists who now in Egypt and other countries in power, little left for Israel, they will first on the difficulties in their own country.
The taken Israel ’ s is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower is hardly the new Arab governments in the overhaul of its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust a ceasefire may be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Even the Israelis should think long term.
While the rest of the Arab world, timid steps in the direction of democratisation that Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
Already the repression is undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Bloody missions to reduce Hamas in the Gaza strip-over the years are increasingly its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outside
The right answer is one of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper: Two states, in which Israel areas for security purposes.
The - for the near future small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders greater influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now share with Turkey and Qatar, the supply of arms in the Gaza strip-stop and is better placed than ever before to Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
That would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state as done with the forthcoming application for UN-observer status.
Obama, too, must do its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were as much a part of the Choir.
But this is a regrettable, shortsighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
