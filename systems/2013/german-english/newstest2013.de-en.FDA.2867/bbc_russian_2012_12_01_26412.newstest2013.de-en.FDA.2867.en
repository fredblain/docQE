In the last few days it came across the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants, popular Fast-Food-chains such as Mc Donald 's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy' s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether they will be back soon.
The protests by unions and several leftist supports nonprofit organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries of simple Walmart- and Fast-Food-workers, the organizers of the protests, which aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, described as the Black Friday, which took place in the US sales, the millions of customers, which sometimes four Handgemengen.
On this day, some Walmart-staff, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, and his work together with unions and leftist activists branches of the chain, whose target low and middle income people.
Walmart sold all products, from diapers on hunting rifles and automotive batteries and vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart-branches is an average of between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the buy-only slightly paid Walmart employees at the workplace.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say the goods can Walmart only so often sell as well, because the staff are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner.
Participants in the protest on "Black Friday" demanding wage increases, and they expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution of the company health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employees, the 9.5-US-dollar the hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company the average wage at 12 dollars, it increases the hour Walmart would cost 3.2 billion dollars.
These are about 1.1% more than they donate now for pay.
The wage increases would Walmart to fully to the customers in the future, each purchase only 46 cents more.
Every year, for they were compared to today by only spending 12,39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only came to protests in nine states and any losses to the company.
The Black Friday in his shop lasted from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, the next day, and during this period Walmart sold approximately 5000 items per second.
As a whole, the Walmart-coffers on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of the leftist Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart-employees work and the protest niederlegten just "another PR-trick" of the trade unions, which organized the protest.
"Free checkout!"
The protests were this week in New York, where her goal but not Walmart-branches (which in this advanced city undesirable and that is why there are so far), but McDonald 's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald 's says that the company should sell billion portions, and yet no sick days we granted unto you, and ye shall not pay for your honest work!

Currently, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York legislation $7.25 an hour.
In Fast-Food-restaurants will gradually raised the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8.90 US-dollar the hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
Once upon a time, nearly a quarter of all US-American young people after the school in McDonald 's behind the counter, but the young people still living with their parents.
Hardly anybody was seen as the main source of income or planned to continue to remain there.
Now I encounter in interviews with staff of McDonald 's constantly people who complain that they manage this reward and sometimes even their children to feed.
On the other hand, there are in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper comment, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if it did not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, which on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before the McDonald 's in the hotel Street and Madison Avenue began demanding that the cashier and chefs of Fast-Food-restaurants a minimum wage of 15 US-Dollar per hour, which received more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the Fast-Food-industry.
The US-American law prevents the management, to stand in the way of this objective and trade unionists in danger or dismissed.
On the other hand, it makes the management is not easy.
The creation of trade unions in the Fast-Food-industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Discontented
Thunderous protests on this day, there were also many other Fast-Food-restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald 's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald' s says it sell billion portions, and yet no sick days we granted unto you, and ye shall not pay for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, BÃ¼rgermeisterkandidat Bill de Blasio, who said that "we should share the Fast-Food-staff, so that they get a fair wage and economic prosperity can achieve the every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest event of its kind in the history of US-American Fast-Food-industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the ground, which is far from everyone in the Fast-Food-industry are employed in the tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise all masses.
