"Brand protection in China:" If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Conceals a in China officially registered designation, which have nothing to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen.
Still, she enjoys protection so long as the actual namesake not complain.
And even then is not clear whether they will get justice.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners, to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing on property right infringements in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The other rich a few additional letters, so that they register their brands.
It is from Gucci simply Lu-instead of Prada, Gucci, Prada-Kny.
German companies are also in this way, legally copied some of the manufacturers.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the Trade Mark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company in the trademarks Zegna DF Puma, a somewhat synthetic label, which is also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese world champion in copying and the injured intellectual property, is known.
In the big cities, there are multistory department stores, which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
Pattlochs cases but are different: On behalf of his clients, he goes against Chinese companies from the Trademark Office officially, a name given the right to use the already elsewhere is protected.
The Chinese call the "bang", a Beifahrermarke Mingpai.
The word is modelled on "Bang Dakuan."
That women were being rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"It will be bad for business, we must combat Pattloch, calls it".
"The brand will be diluted, the uniqueness will disappear, the damage is enormous."
The financial losses and litigation costs of the industries concerned are going in the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA is China with a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the registered are difficult to reach and go to the money.
Up to nine years is the proceedings drag on, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reporting of cases in which the court overruled claims, because after the long duration of the defective name had become the "reality".
If the plaintiff had the misfortune to pay Plagiator even money because he violated its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphical elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, the company that recently took over the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister.
The Chinese must therefore still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes-star.
The Volvo-buyer Geely took advantage of a blue-white logo, the BMW reminded; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The Modehersteller Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China, Hong Kong and Singapore, which the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing is that there is 2010 due to staffing and finishing of bottlenecks.
Last year, however, is one of the "emergency" in the workflow returned to normal.
So is the stock appeals procedure usually at 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases we have completed 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet still waiting in the office 81.500 objections to fulfillment.
Address it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million requests to brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China for the tenth consecutive year, the list of Neuanmeldungen all over the world, shares the authority with.
This applies also to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 were 1.8 billion yuan in fees have been taken.
This means that any simplified registration on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Address it costs a lot more, as the case of the German company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans were able to ensure that its illegal production was mined imitation of German automotive industry.
But secured the counterfeiters to continue the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg.
We have failed in Germany, as the family could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two bodies Freudenberg got it right, but the fighting Prozessgegner still further.
It must be extremely
Now, the matter before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is confident that the thing to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were not quantify the Firmenarchiv have even one hundred years old files need to review the evidence.
Five years ago, the other side, Freudenberg in vain "with a" high rates to resolve.
"This shows how much this is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East zur√ºckzuschwappen even threaten to Europe.
That is, if they secure imitators vulnerable brands.
So did a Chinese manufacturer in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
In this area, the company has long since abandoned, however, he could turn the registration.
"We have to be careful," says Wentzler on the other.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch German companies to advise in dealings with China to be very careful.
It is not enough to turn to international trademark rights to leave the foreigners should somehow "everything that is worth protecting, even in China, as in" Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it will be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg in the last act of his Markendramas is, it should be the other side pay royalties for their own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be squeezed out of the market segment in question.
