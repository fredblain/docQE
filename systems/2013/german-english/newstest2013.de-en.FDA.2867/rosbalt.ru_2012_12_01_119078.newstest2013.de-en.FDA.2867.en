My own taste rather than culture - rosbalt.ru
The project "Rosbalt Petersburg vanguard", the urban residents, which is dedicated to the vanguard of art and culture.
On the exquisite list landed already senior representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose success beyond the boundaries of the city, and the often recognition in Europe, with no known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The entire city is familiar with Kirill Miller, the bearded dressed in red, you ’ re at the Russian Museum, sometimes in the summer garden, with scene-meetings or at openings.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they also attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socially-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures his presence on the street by its citizens a smile to the face and keeps them for good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler, as he is to this difficult role in relation to his Künstlerdasein, his philosophy and his image was finally ready.
- Kirill, why you are always in red and not for example in yellow and turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, with the optics and the image.
In this world is red, the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In the company calls on anything that deviates from some of the Graunorm, aggression and bad behavior.
But let me through my provocation with the people.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
- When did you know that you will have to painter?
- At an exhibition in the Palace of Culture, the main city in my work were issued.
I realised that I must go this way.
Then, the time of the old free, but not officially recognized the painter at the time, and new and free painters such as I was incomprehensible.
I befriended me with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was only once.
It takes me to the theatre, fashion, music actually to all except the literature.
- And all the united in your kind-clinic... - It was important for me, in the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather themselves together.
In 1995, I held a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and then there were up to the renovation work a musically-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: NAME., Tequilajazzz, and, I also remember string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" there.
String and his friends sang simple songs for the Play-back, wearing tight shirts and one of them was the trendy composer Igor Wdowin today.
As the group started to play live, was "Leningrad from it."
Trachtenberg moderated many programmes before the time of "Halli Galli-."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us.
Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art-clinic.
There, our staff and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture or something.
In 2000 there was a poll in the press, the award "personalities of our city."
I won in the category "artist of the year" and that I was at the peak.
It is not easy in new times after old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
At the present time it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous, without a cultural contribution.
- your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring the timeliness and sharpness of thought.
I will be an exhibition on the theme of "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier, I was socially, but now it pains and fear, however.
In a clown blurs all this and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have preposterous ideas.
We save the world, for example, by making that everyone has to fully disguise.
Now everyone on the clothes and is modelled on the exterior and the interior of the people.
But perhaps we should not give a person, but should spit him in the face.
The deception is disappearing through their "dressing".
- Before recently, we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - A cultural city should have a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can also commercial art be beautiful?
- It has to commercial art cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of the cultures.
The people in large groups: The bohemians loved the One and the ordinary people of the other.
Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not "one-dollar-note that everyone likes.
Now you have to consider, if you like.
Now, each Kultstar about 100 supporters.
- On the appearances of stas Michailow but several thousand!
- The abandoned him are women, the sexually-social sphere plays a role.
300 people come for cultural reasons and not 10 thousand, therefore, there is less Management, money, and anything goes.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such images in a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow hung.
I started with images, which are usually only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are many misunderstandings.
It means: Intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and who died in poverty and money in order to be able to paint.
That is the culture, which I support.
Petersburg - Kirill, what is missing?
- Good be cultural experts.
They say: Servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Czar, it was different, because the Tsar might not seen much of culture, but it is understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good consultant.
In St. Petersburg, we have what might be, the experts, but they will be barred, because it requires hochrangigerer experts, the former and properly assess the way.
Now, only the own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they will not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore seek other museums.
- What is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones can be difficult to grow up art.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers as a reader, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many people who are curious, exhibitions and concerts.
For us, these are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is the city of Saint Petersburg from grants funded
