The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court, the Law on voluntary work.
This decision was in the public a lively discussion.
It is certainly interesting, the issue even from a wider perspective.
The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free movement of private capital, with rampant speculation goes hand in hand.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) Preisspannungen.
Under this term to understand is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying, by importing cheaper goods in economic competition, "" undercut the competition, turning it into a larger share of the market and to usurp his win.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their production abroad or cheap shopping, or their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since the capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rising unemployment caused is necessarily the spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and thus the overall economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics at this point are superfluous.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced, in competition with each other, the social standards to reduce its own population, thereby artificially into the country to attract foreign capital.
In other words, the governments will deliver its own people, without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is especially in amendments of existing laws.
The objective of these measures is to force its own population, in particular the dictates of private capital in terms of wages.
This is achieved by economic coercion in long term unemployment, by restricting the rights of workers.
The results are growing poverty and increasing disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there has for some years public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of those affected are already in the millions.
In the wake of the increase the competitiveness of the German economy, cases in which workers paid such a low level that the state of their incomes increase until the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also in the case of workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity of practically all EU-Southern states will no doubt in the same state, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the fringes of society, and it is to be hoped that at some point private investment capital flowing into the country.
Of course there is the question of where this capital?
If it from another EU country-, only the poverty from one country to another, or from the capital remains the same, as in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco and Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media say ad nauseam that the state does not with capital to its own economy is involved, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
The private capital blinkered insistence on his view that the state does not lenkend should intervene in the economy.
But then we have to ask whether the capital the policy and that the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even.
Here is the unequivocal answer: Yes.
Proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and all the ubiquitous lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual advantage, legislation, in the virtually anything criminally, but nothing is a punishable offence.
In Germany, the situation is such that a lack of finances Staatsministerium private, closely with industry Rechtsunternehmen interdependent with the development of individual.
This legislation is adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence will no longer, as the people of the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously that liberal democracies is currently in a situation which Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompey ': "The state has long been understood in decay, and the authorities have been occupied with violence.
Against bribe through illegal fraudulent use of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption fascia incontinent, and the people went with already bought votes in the election "..." people with character applied not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul "..." Man began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a dictatorship and that a strong man "... Appian should be elected to this, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, the democracy permanently by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, is based society today as in ancient times on the reckless preference of their own advantage, without on societal interests.
The private sector is, by its very nature, is not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society and to recognize.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least concern for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the current state of view, the demise of the regime in favour of liberal democracies as some pause, during which the next round already.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today â€™ s elites in future the loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have already witnessed today, as well as the crimes against humanity, such as those from the older and contemporary history, in utter ignorance.
The repeal of the law on voluntary work here is not a solution, at least no permanent.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of the social standards to push down the population.
This trend is therefore systembedingt.
The only solution are targeted political-social reforms, which is the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in favor of the state in the society.
