Poland and the space.
Poland was last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a member of that ROSKOSMOS s savage twentieth. Poland is the second Member State from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, that on 12 November 2008 ESA member-).
Poland started in 1994 a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years of several ESA-projects.
The path of Poland in space, however, was much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space, they are not always understanding.
I refer, for example, to the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work "entrance to the Exploration".
The ideas of the young engineer (nee 1905), the audience, however, cold, and after years of Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won for "entrance to the Exploration" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch donated Prix rep-Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a key supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognised contribution to the development of space, thereby acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 in Poland had built a railway-trolley for which a Raketenantrieb planned.
The author of the proposal and the details of this project, remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or the brakes of the trolley should be used.
The information originates exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry with raketenbetriebenen floors.
The research led the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents show that the research to the stage of practical tests vorgedrungen war.
The research was then, however, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht suspended.
In 1937, some in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, draft photoelectric Jagdrakete on, and in the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza Leliwa-Krzywoblocky" of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for military use of missile technology from the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, his work, however, from the war ended.
Another article on space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first is that society in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in the four large items of space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future of space exploration.
Already at its inception in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA for accession to the 1951 formed International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA has been an active member of the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA-chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
He had this position until his death in 1959.
In 1956, the PTA has participated in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959, and began in the Błędów-desert flight tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kilos.
A further development stage should already be capable of real scientific work to do - the rocket RM-34 with an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the observation of Höhenwinden.
In 1962, he was the further development.
Successor to the first missiles of type RM, from 1962 to 1965 developed meteor-1-Rakete.
The rocket was conceived as a Zweistufenrakete their total length, 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.
From the rocket, three types (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which manifested in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A-rocket had a transport with 0.4 litres capacity, meteor-1B on 0.34 liters and meteor-1c about 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude, with all three types of 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968 was the meteor-Luftfahrtinstitut 2-Rakete develops, its first flight tests in October 1970 started.
Meteor-2 had a weight of 380 kg and was able to a payload of 10 kg in a height of approximately 60 km.
Meteor-versions were then musing and meteor-3.
It is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, the two years later to the establishment of a national COSPAR-committee.
Poland participated in the context of the Interkosmos-program at the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second Interkosmonaut.
