In a constantly elektrisierten world it is beautiful, even to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
I had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not want to lie.
Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, steuerfreies Shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and lead Kindesentwicklungsexperten boredom as something positive.
So far as they are concerned, it is for us, and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.
This is the brain, forced into interesting thoughts to lose the creativity.
And because most of us today is almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, are no longer the benefits of boredom.
The boredom, so we should welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, with increasing leisure has developed.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), the not so.
"Indeed, the boredom has a very long history", he says.
Pompejis adorns the walls, a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the problem is that boredom in many ways is defined and discussed.
After a long reading of literature and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, "a satisfactory activity, but not to want to be able to define".
Boredom is different from apathy that that the person is not considered, but would like to be.
At the apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.
The Schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to "disruption of the Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad temper and the sense that the time passes slowly."
Boredom is almost as such as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions related to bored people could see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that we have is boring, even if we just have difficulties to us.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - used to: "The idle mind: The definition of boredom from the point of view of attention" that "in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science" appeared, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues at an earlier experiment, in which participants a band, a person who listened to read a Magazinartikel.
Some groups have heard a loud TV from the neighbouring area, which has nothing to do with the content. Other heard it to lower volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group these noises do not hear them.
The people who heard the barely audible television, said, more boring than the other two groups - feel they have had problems to concentrate, for they could find no reason and wrote its difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task to focus the attention of the disorder can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, a monotonous work - "as the search for faulty products on a Fabrikförderband can distract, music and help to feel not bored."
In fact, he says, we know now that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people can combat physically attentive remain.
"Studies have shown that children who must herumhampeln learn more and more information than those who are forced to sitting still," Professor Fenske.
We will all eventually boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender speakers, a particularly tedious film.
But some people bore more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980s to Langeweileanfälligkeit a "scale".
On the scale, you will find statements such as "Many things that I must do repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers found that boys more boring than girls, as Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, regarding the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli.
But teenagers are generally a pretty abgespannter bunch.
In 1991 led Reed Larson, professor of human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted.
He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and the comes from doing the homework were bored, while 23% said that to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said, is to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increased or decreased.
It is certain, however, that "the youth is perceived as very boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their Alltagsablauf.
Back to my Ursprungsfrage: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in the extreme case leads them to that people extreme physical risks and gambling, or drugs to relieve studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, of the issue for more than two decades.
"With the boredom wants the brain a say that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain knows what you are not always the best should do.
If a boring and it is this energy used to playing guitar and to cook, will be happy.
But television can for happiness in the short term, but in the long term they dissipate.
Whoever his bored child, then, an iPad, it can while away from the boredom, and it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child learns not just to entertain, but also in other areas receive more self.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not to take a critical view of them.
Instead, our aim should be to us away from the ongoing activities and Technologieberieselung structure.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth just look for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to deal with, if the noise even has fallen silent."
