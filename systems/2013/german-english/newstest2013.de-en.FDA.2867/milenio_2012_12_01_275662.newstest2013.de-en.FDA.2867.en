Cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the SRC: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bombshell," he says, referring to the moment when he received the diagnosis, the doctor with no discernible success "tried to mitigate."
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to just about his illness and started to take care of themselves; and to inform this with such commitment that he has just celebrated its 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV-unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several struggles in 1994.
Fabrizio-living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which for 22 years at the beginning of the 1990s, when it was hard to imagine many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, it avoided even the director a clinic of the IMSS, to adopt "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible that this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.
But there are still many people in the clinic, who know nothing of their illness and in which the virus damage has already exhausted and their immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, that is, after the first reported cases, "means the great success today that the survival of a patient who in the treatment and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV-unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information in April of this year, backed by a respected scientific publication.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 schlussfolgerten that AIDS is not a death sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life of the extent of the impairment of the immune system of the people at the start of treatment, and that those who had not greater opportunities that are dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with one count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, mean that the above, who at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in this sense, "can be easily 75 years old, as long as he is under control," said this expert.
This progress in order to be able to properly, I must point out that the life expectancy of Mexicans live, on average, 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS by 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of the yes)), it is nevertheless true that since the release of the AIDS 60 percent of the national database captured patients have died.
Alone in Jalisco died in 2011 255 people, and to the month of May this year are already 187 deaths; however, assured that it since 2005 universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- Why is still people die?
- In my opinion, the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years ago we had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people in an advanced state come, because they do not know their Infektionszustand, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a percussive statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality earlier diagnoses are required, which is why all those people, where this is necessary, must be offered massive screening tests."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (government committee to AIDS-prevention in Jalisco) and also the patient as Fabrizio, of its test carried out at a private laboratory, for the simple reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS-phase, and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which was one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and would like to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then three times to burst", says one in my case.
The change was to out improvement, I ernähre me well, practise sport and take the drugs.
His parents now know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, as anyone else.
"I work, go a lot, have an active, but responsible Sexleben, I respect to my health and the other person," Fabrizio, the agreed to his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony, in order to encourage those who today as part of the global AIDS-day scared.
They should make the test if they are to be. The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, should they learn how to live like all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens are large holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which was the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
On the specific places ", the distribution of condoms were actually increased, and once made them individually, now they give us packages with a hundred piece, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The risk persons for new infections include the young people.
"What you need the?" Is a widespread Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal by social workers, in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system, the young people do not want to expose the correspondent.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution to move on; the condoms are not just behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of institutions, who often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted the promiscuity.
They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms are distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not enough; the best way to use those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key properties of Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is seen 4th place nationally in new and any accumulated AIDS-cases and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of contagious takes place through sexual intercourse, 6% above the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because it is for every registered case 4 or 5, there are people who do not know.
