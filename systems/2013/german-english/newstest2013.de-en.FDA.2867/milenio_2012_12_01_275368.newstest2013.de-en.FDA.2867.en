"South America during the integration of the citizens have to learn," says Rafael Correa
The president, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, with "South America actually can learn something from Europe."
Correa, of the Sixth Summit of the President of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) attended nations, which took place in Lima, said the state television in Peru that Europeans "in the Second World War and in other clashes were killing" and "virtually a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur.
"Must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as has been the case in the Andean Community; there are still, however, reactionary sectors that want a return to the past," he warned.
The president of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organisation of American States (OEA) under the premise that the influence of the United States to reduce those states and to take into account that the agreement of San Jose on human rights.
Those who commit themselves to teach something never and, in return, we are signing the South Americans are everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the interamerikanische Commission for Human Rights, headquartered in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, the Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has conceded.
Correa said that he did not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights has fulfilled".
He added that it had been "reasoned assumptions that Assange extradited to a third country and its procedure will not be observed."
He also criticised the Swedish justice, which required him to its territory, an interrogation because of alleged Sexualdelikts, while "to the Swedish case law that allowed through a video conferencing over the message of Ecuador in London would be executed."
Correa said that the danger that the health and the mental state of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, the ambassador has informed me that he is, however, a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious", said the head of state of Ecuador.
There was, however, a risk that he take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises outdoors.
"This would adversely affect the health of all people," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum, the Assange for the month of June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, the granting of a Freibriefs, by which he was travelling in Ecuador, and that that is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe 's. He emphasised that it had been with London talks to resolve the captive founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, this word in this case we are not, however, there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedure leads to various European authorities," he said.
And "if Britain morning this licence is, however, in my opinion."
And if Sweden Mr Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or on Skype up and interrogated, as it allows the Swedish justice and in other cases, is the problem.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to portray himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said to confirm that what he does not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie that freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politician, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador is not more of such journalists "and not by the bankers or hegemonic and dominated spießbürgerlichen countries", and took away at a reelection that he "will deepen the revolution to lead the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the (at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism "remain firm and no opportunism and must not be allowed to grant a legal coup" because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The president of Ecuador is also keeping the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua were highly irregular in the advantage they gave the seerechtlichen borders between the two countries to negotiate for "absolutely justified."
This judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a Southern and a Central American country.
Conflicts are unavoidable, but they are in pursuit of a common path.
They must be comprehensively, so that they can overcome and look to the future.
He is just as familiar to a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the Court of Justice and said that "it is Latin America is right to call for international bodies, both countries to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, for his third term in a row, he gave at the possibility that he "with a lot of optimism and, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he was losing the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Makes has never interested me personally, but under so unfair circumstances such as in Ecuador these socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was, the probable victory guaranteed, I must therefore this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my final period as President, then I would prefer from public life.
This applies also, if we lose.
"This is definitely," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he planned, for a routine treatment have travelled there, and that is that he would again after the election campaign could travel to Cuba.
"It means, in any case, a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez", he said.
