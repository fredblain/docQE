"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season with PSG you have taken on a new dimension.
How do you explain this progress?
You can find it by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also has given me a lot.
These elements spurring me on a daily basis, to improve the quality of play.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football is all very quickly.
But I must stop not in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always gradual progress.
You are thus the use of imported competition by Carlo Carlo...
The new additions this summer games are accustomed to a very high level.
They also know that any training is crucial.
This means that a player who, as I have to stand up to and his best wishes.
Carlo Carlo, gives me a lot in terms of my Spielposition.
He is of Co-trainers such as Claude Makelele, of how I played on the same position.
Carlo is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Carlo instills all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a rich experience and has many titles with prestigious clubs won.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging talk with him.
At that time, I have just recovered from a Verletzungsserie.
The trust he has placed in me, is also a statement of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon have taken the place of the Company.
But we are in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We have in this way to the last sixteen.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will oppose very good European teams to have our say.
Firstly, we first of our group in Porto, so that we match the return leg of the event can unsubscribe.
Can the PSG in the short term, a major European club?
He already has the budget for this...
In order to become a major European club Paris title win, you have to make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially the PSG funds so that this project concrete forms.
It would be a great failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to win this, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really at the heart of this track suit.
Last season, we were close to it.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to the victory.
We have opened the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But a different team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept the perfect.
However, if we with a home match against Troyes 4-0 win, and you still have to find something that you can accuse us of, this is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never every weekend with 4-0 win.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to establish a concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have strength.
Look at Manchester City, an association of the past two seasons, fails to qualify for the last sixteen, and which also made huge expenditure!
With regard to the invested sums believed you to break with 15 points.
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, the last season, were not well were from this new PSG "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 exciting.
I hope that we in the month of May will be smiling winner and tell us that we, in spite of all the difficulties they have won.
The PSG seems entirely from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that of a "Zlatan-dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic and has many goals.
That is why he came and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a superstar.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respect for the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This inspires others to improve their quality.
Thiago Silva, of one of the world â€™ s best defender is also allows all others to make progress.
As you have the Euro 2012 experienced with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I was anxious to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented a little time.
I have seen things there, from which I am stronger.
Today, I am, good games in the national team.
This was for my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus?"
He has promising results.
We have a good position in the opening for the World Cup.
The tournament is strictly, is close to the players and to the victory.
As Laurent Blanc was.
But I do not want to comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by us for the EM.
I hope that the "Bleus" Didier Deschamps will lead to Brazil.
Is this on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1: 1) a Auftaktspiel?
This game has given us confidence.
Each has been used for all the other.
In this meeting in Spain, I have never been a similar game in my career.
