Daily butter drink - and 168 years old
Many people in the south of Azerbaijan achieve a biblical high age.
There is even a museum for durability.
Search for clues in the country where 97-year is still relatively young.

Search for clues in the country where 97-year is still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch-mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus Brunei on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one might think, you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here, the Caucasian ethnic Talyschen, not much is known, except that it perfectly Persian and Aserisch speaks and very durable.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small town with protzt to greedy wuchtig architecture from Soviet times, so do not fit in the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists come from Europe, hardly here too onerous, the directions from Azeri capital of Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth, it owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is here in the province has not yet arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik this stuff on the tourist attraction.
"Baku was founded in May with the Eurovision-song-festival famous, and next year, we have here a festival of the oldest person in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen documented in the area more than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-white-photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years begat another child
But controversial Star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, 168 years old.
However, there is not a birth certificate.
And, in view of the oldest documented people of 122 years old, was Müslümovs age but extremely dubious.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and have been 23 children, aged 136 years he fathered a daughter.
So has Şirali Müslümov at his age by a couple of decades will be charged?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, Altersforscher at the Max-Planck-Institute in Rostock, of the very elderly in Central Asia.
"Striking many hochaltrige people there are also in some areas of China-Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men".
However, due to the lack of documentation is no scientific proof of age, especially to register.
Every day becherweise melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik striking an uncritical often age.
There are currently 20 persons that are more than 100 years old.
So why are living here in the south so many Hochbetagte?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the with the specific genes of Talyschen.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that the diet.
But that the kalorienreiche diet of Talyschen as healthy, the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of them daily drink a glass of melted butter, is also beneficial from a nutritional point of view is not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years it is for these latitudes is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have, 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a Butterfass they tirelessly herrollt back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two small children jump around.
In the kitchen, there is the guests tea in the typical bauchförmigen Armadu-glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in and hides it under her headscarf, long, dunkelblonde braids who proudly unveiled her son before us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and retained their color.
"Shampoo, I have never used," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always only the eaten, what of their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not once in the supermarket food purchased.
Then she told her husband, who was in the army.
Worst of all, it was in the period following the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar" Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds odd from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, his son Ilham later took over the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan ’ s Old.
230 Al-Lat (about the same amount in euros), receives a monthly pension Mirzayeva for local conditions, the amount of which we can live well.
And perhaps has long Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: "The old enjoy in our culture respect."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved and cared for, are happy.
If that is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive
