Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month ago, to the end of the world?
This is one of those technology-based jobs, on which we have people just like you.
With our band The Tap Tap let us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which collect enough positive energy in order to avoid stopping or the end of the world.
In December, you also a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we have been planning for two years.
For this purpose, we want the Marketingpotenzial of the Maya calendar, whose end-use for the 21st December at 11: 10 a.m. is forecast.
The day before that, on 20 December, from 21: 00 at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno, Ostrava.
The end of the concerts in about at the time to be on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a timezone at 12 hours before us, the Maya-calendar ends.
Who is this idea?
Originally from me, then we have the idea, together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
In this connection, we would not only collect enough positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, but we would also like to consider together with the public on the state of the world, we handed over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya-calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key rings on the end of the world, with their purchase over www.e-tap.cz also support the people.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers also the anthem about the end of the world, with the title "doomsday" comes from.
Even today, the hymn to YouTube very popular. It will also perform at the undoubtedly?
Of course, in the end, provided that all is fine and the end of the world is not happening...
The anthem is of all the performers in all three concerts at the same time be sung.
In addition, the anthems together in a Direktschaltung from the Czech television broadcast live.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who is also the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also plays Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to the cooperation with two?
We cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene that is that we realize many fundraisers and concerts...
We endeavour to these people in our projects.
It has been shown that most are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts on the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible Bildungszentrums Studeo, on which we have already six years with the association Tap in Jedlička-Institute.
The students of the Jedlička-Institute are regularly of editors, who will help them with different activities.
As the pupils themselves do not have the wherewithal to the editors, we want to help them in this way.
In the completion of the Jedlička-Institute is a private building, in which we then with this project.
During each concert, several groups and performers.
On what criteria do you have these selected?
We wanted a program that all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, enter Chinaski, support Lesbiens Illustratosphere support, with Dan, The {T} {T}, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
"Similar" big events are also planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
We would also like to next year in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we ever in the United States, it would also be happy to appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their Auslandspläne are not just small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these travel logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it first seems.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold. We must also, of course, many Instrumentenkoffer and other luggage...?
Nevertheless, it has been without problems, ČSA airlines and British Airways were always very well prepared to us that I am sometimes surprised have already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By foreign travel, you have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility looks, as there is with disabled people, etc.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, in which everything works better than us, we were just in Russia, witnessing the east is still in its infancy.
To Prague is absolutely not disabled Moscow, where it is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is, of course, there is not even a wheelchair user, for example, in the elevator usually half hourly.
Fortunately, there are clubs, trying on the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect, we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things, in which we are lagging behind.
This is, however, to note that an improvement in the situation depends also always from the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usual that even people with severe disabilities independently in a public space, toilets can use etc.
But it is not normal that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events, and we are with the band The Tap Tap the West a little ahead!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when one of our own significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers are being things really begin to change.
So far, these are isolated incidents of particularly sister personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. However, if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to found a band?
Then I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička-Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in, with a little hard.
And as I, myself, am among musicians and Sax games, I have, along with a colleague, a music-AG was founded.
Oh, and by the time this is how our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, to say, somewhat out of control (laughs).
The band was known only in the last few years, or not?
It is true that the cooperation with famous singers has helped; we also have also started to campaign actively for us.
We are aware that if something is doing this to the outside world and not to see their own performance is, in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to the EU-funds can we also good editors, high quality equipment and etc.
It was your aim, it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the outset, I sensed the potential that things are not acceptable.
Often copied in show business today, one of the other.
This is on its way, logical, because everything is new with caution and will be accepted only after some time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that {T} {T} among them.
The first impression that usually has the audience is, of course, pity; this is only of course...
But this pity is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not a lonely and abandoned, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities something, not only for themselves is progress, but for the whole of society.
It was for this success is also helpful that you are a strict boss, as we heard by many people?
If you would like to make a good, we must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain degree of discipline.
This is, in my opinion, but absolutely normal.
Some are coming to us with romantic notions, and when they discover that they have twice a week test phases must overcome and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many fast.
So it works but everywhere, in every band, the serious work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go, which cannot be prevented.
Who has the will and the desire to join with us, is always welcome.
