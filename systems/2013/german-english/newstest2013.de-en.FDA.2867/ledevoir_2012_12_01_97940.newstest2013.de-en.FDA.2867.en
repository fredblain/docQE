Palliative care, the best way to die | Le Devoir...
With its Committee on "death with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of Lebensendes.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill being prepared.
However, in this important area still much to do.
Le Devoir has tried to look at it more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, he aufzehrte, had a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years been achieved," he said, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois lying in Beloeil, in which he arrived the day before.
"However, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: A vast weakness prevents any alone on the toilet and even to eat.
On the table in front of a tasty lunch, he resigned, agrees with the help of a meal.
He even manages to bravely smiling and talking with the strangers who are busy around him, his medication, and a bathroom.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, as this is" humiliating, he shares with.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"During our lifetime we learn that a man standing government," says Pierre Brodeur notching, Victor-Gadbois psychologist at the home.
In return for certain persons Kindheitsphase is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person, a step backwards," he says.
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, major events in the midst of this setback.
The patients in the home for palliative care and Victor-Gadbois, are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are from the doctors and nurses who look after them, no longer with so called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fears realised by suffocation, "and" to die.
But the disease, I met my children.
"I have good kids," she added.
"I have no wishes more in life," she says, before it accepts that you set a mask, her in breathing helps.
They are expected in the next few days is still a last visit her son, who is from Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the intake of food.
The palliative care will be used when there are no other possibilities exist any more.
More pleasant for the deaths.
In Quebec, popular residents on a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little if you consider that one day we will all die.
This is the life under the best possible conditions continue, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying depending on a swiss with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control their blood sugar level.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we have Mr X a beer is served, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son, the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We will help families and patients alike," said Nathalie Pflegedirektorin Savard.
The home Victor-Gadbois is different every day.
In addition to an old man of 93, the last Familienzusammenkunft well in the courtyard and is backed by his pillow, while his honour of opening dies of 36 years ago, a young man by his parents, his wife and two young children, is tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years occupied," Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with.
53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, in other words a care that is to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stages of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organisations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is this big shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors of the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and suicide assistiertem with concerns.
For the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent personalities of the palliative care such as Dr. United Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec, according to the health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to a high quality palliative care before you have accepted on euthanasia.
Recently, she says, have I seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room was without measures taken to their relief.
I am afraid that the patient only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions doggedly to the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as she has aborted an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist tumour that I will break the treatment, they replied that they regret that the fight will be pleasantly surprised, I told them.
However, they told me that I was in the end!
No omnipotente care
Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, to thank the nurses that this wish has not granted after their pain is relieved by a team of palliative care.
But it must be made clear that the palliative care in the treatment is not chosen.
According to prednisolone Monereau, head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Greater Montreal talk about 8% of patients not on a pain relief.
At the end of life, the doctors are often on the terminale sedation, which amounts to the patients either sporadically or permanently einzuschläfern up at the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the option to these terminale sedation.
Patients, not alleviate their pain, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily, "I want you to put me", but "I want my pain."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a Journalismusstipendiums Canadian Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute.
