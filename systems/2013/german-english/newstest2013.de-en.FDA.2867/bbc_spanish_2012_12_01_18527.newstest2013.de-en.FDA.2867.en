Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Blame the Singapurer to ensure that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and bringing up children.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfil our released and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper-songs, the local slogans such as "pushing will be a" good "(loaf) in the oven to the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun.
The advertising agency BBH, who shot the video, respects the hope that the advert in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of the music, the people wanted to implement its "national duty."
This is something only for Internet, we therefore had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When propagated, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we get to grips with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with or under the organisation of speed-dating-evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were led creative, but not necessarily to success.
Therefore we thought: Why do we not something as creatively as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?
1.2 children
If this issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore.
Every year they 1,300 US-dollar for political action in order to encourage more people to have children.
A package of government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax advantages.
But everything has had little success.
Singapore is a richer, more city state in the southeast of Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known.
According to his national Bevölkerungsbehörde, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time these rate was about 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why get the Singapurer no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this in a "better training" and "greater opportunities."
"This has the people except to marry and to form a family far more options in terms of goals and priorities," she says.
These changes in the social realities have higher number of single parents and the delay of the marriage and births, the result of which contributed to the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that led to a dramatic increase in the influx, in order to counter the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the little laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for that they keep wages down and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year boxes since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt to the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on the economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the health costs and the immigration policy, Singapore has also unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small flats are being built.
She also has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun, the number of small apartments to control, which are known as "Schuhschachteln" and built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great success in terms of sales.
However, there is the concern that the lifestyle of the living alone, and that they can promote the construction companies tendency, large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "Schuhschachteln" much faster than larger units sell.
They are so popular, and the units are for days or even weeks faster than the larger units sold out.
This means that it is for our cash flow are much better.
He, however, is that the new standards the developers clearer guidelines, which previously put obstacles when they were too many small units within a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules of the road to a rise in national birthrate might cause, is in talks with the Singapurern who work in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are highly stressed, the apartments and the education are expensive, so it takes to say" by many a young managers.
The kids can others.
"For me, it is important for my own money and time to have another," says about twenty years old man.
Men and women of their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as the reasons that they have no children.
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to have children, as can the government still so much to do.
