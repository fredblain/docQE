The film Argo: If 's worst call, Hollywood
In November 1979 Islamist students occupied a mob who demonstrated the US-American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the following the revolution in the US, which for decades had fled the patronage of his regime had maintained.
For the American Government, there were no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to jettison the Shah, as this is the confidence of their allies in other countries have been severely damaged.
At the same time, she was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco when violent attempt to retrieve made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released for 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages, home to a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, the US a partial victory.
Just before the occupation of the message, six Botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the home of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; then helped them an extravagant story for the concealment of their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes locations, the supposedly in the country for a science-fiction-film.
Combination of genres
The experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the cooperation of Hollywood.
The disguise was credible, published articles in professional journals about this film, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, he is a more realistic and, at the same time, leading a so called "Caper Movie", i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as, for example, the film Ocean 's Eleven.
This alternate in the movie the Stimmungsebenen - on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence are iconic contemporary photographs shown to be watched, and also in the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and devising so easily.
And then there ’ s the-scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, on the Amtsfluren, on the phone...
Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable reboot of his career.
From a spokesmen ridiculed actor is a respected director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the target ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film after the thriller No breeze (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is the first movie Afflecks, not in the local Boston of the director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the village belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood.
Affleck proves this sense, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played."
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the Eingangssequenz the storming of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, however, and conveys a sense of confusion and the unpredictability, that happens, if somewhere even the story.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictitious scenes (the wrong Filmstab at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to deal with that, too, that the story is not many in the cinematic sense exciting scenes.
He is working with the little but quite successful, although he sometimes nachhilft reality - something which would not always so elegantly acting (the scenes in which the looming crisis in the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America is avoided, or the chase on the runway, looked a bit contrived).
The weakness of Argo is his overly broad scattering, which is due to the need for too much in action in too many places to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood-staff is very charming, its characters but would have more space, and they are in the film is far from alone.
Afflecks film loses traction by something. It is a movie you with some interest and the design and to a thriller from the 70th years can approve of its retro-style.
However, he enthusiastically raises difficult.
As a reminder of a until today in some way living piece of history and as evidence of how exaggerated but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, however, he is sufficient.
