Guidelines for the inflate of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the oddest of bank charges this year, has decided that the competition "Absurdeste regulation or idea from the EU-workshop".
"This idea brought us the latest plan put forward by the EU, a 40% quota of introducing in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organisation of this survey, Právo told the newspaper.
The absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the Court of Justice on the unification of Versicherungstarife for men and women.
Until then, women in an advantage enjoyed life insurance for insurance companies, because they are objectively less risk.
"Another incredible incursions from the EU-workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013 Nacher with, "said.
The controversial EU-regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol for fuel in its wake naturschädigend is, the more the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, just because it is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes, or the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were significantly more expensive.
Scores of criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even a ban on the sale of conventional lamps.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU decides-apparatus often under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more Member States will be represented at the moment (so tried the Czech Republic, for example, also with veto-threat to the demands of Czech banks).
Lobby-interests were also discovered that the highest Handelsklasse bananas in the EU must be at least 14 cm long Krümmungsanomalie "and not" are not allowed.
The European Commission defended themselves with the argument that they are only the fragmented national standards harmonisiere, the trade.
The standards relating to fruit and vegetables from the EU were against the opposition of some countries have already weakened by pointing out that the previous directives to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU-regulation of last year, according to balloons sales must be provided with the hint that children under eight years the balloon not without the supervision of an adult bloat.
The EU, citing an American study in accordance with balloons at the leading cause of death by suffocation of children.
A similar restriction is already for children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious incursions at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that European officials itself - everyone in the EU has an official function, because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece does not use the name Macedonia and FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) say.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists let fair in addition to the above mentioned absurdities also the EU-regulation on the scale of Lebensmittelvorräten in the territory of a Member State.
The EU, so that the maximum volume of Lebensmittelvorräten firmly focused on the day of our EU-accession on the territory of the Czech Republic was located.
The Czech Republic then crossed the fixed volume for Pilzkonserven result for us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or of the idea of funding for applications for grants.
These ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are affected by that we have no sea.
We will refund request in the EU in the autumn of 2004, "said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As the argument that the harvest was very high and the government as a result of the so called Interventionseinkäufe camp.
As the Czech Republic, another way to sea ports, the EU should have the Palas hundreds of millions of euros of us pay.
The European Commission has so far in the Czech Republic, finally, that they have a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries, which have no access to the sea.
Grants for applications for funding offered the municipalities of the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-deu) should, in practical terms, this means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen act in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are in the Member States are easy targets of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation and thus also for effectiveness and development of the whole European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more credit.
A more serious problem is rather that experts believe that the EU-funds for projects that are absolutely nothing with the deepening of European integration, but they have in common with the budget negotiations have been forced by individual Member States.
Emotions calls here also the fact that the Czech Republic, similar to other Member States in Brussels for the right to use of specific descriptions of traditional products and to fight this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic, six years after a fight with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us back to the 19th century, however, our manufacturers in "Tuzemák."
The name rum may only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU in the company of the world famous cheese, feta and gorgonzola started the Lübeck or Parmaschinkens now also the Karlovy Vary rusks, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or even the (hops.
With an EU-brand as the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořicer roles to shout about.
