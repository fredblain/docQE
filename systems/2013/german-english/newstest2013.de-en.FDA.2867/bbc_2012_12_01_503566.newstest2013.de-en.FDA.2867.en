Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but all over the world.
The secret of success of the country could something with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish have to do?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, moist sportswear.
And leave it there a week.
That must be the smell of Rakfisk nasenbetäubenden, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent aroma in the air, which just won ’ t go away.
Rakfisk is salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you would like your fish stink - up to a year in water ferments.
If in the dark about the country and the weather gets colder Norwegians to flock here in Fagernes, that this, well, really very impressive speciality.
"You eat it raw and carries it with a glass of aquavit down", says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a "General" also-Rakfisk festival.
Around us, people eat small Fischwürfel and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk Amazing," says.
The spirit can crowd out the smell.
I go with some appetizers.
If it avoids the Rakfisk to bring in Nasennähe, he is not bad, like sushi, which is quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era when there was the first in the autumn and fish as watered Salzwasserfässern.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and, no doubt, steamed senses - with the help of alcohol consumed.
Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and, mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, which not so long ago was much richer than Norway, flock to immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly are backed part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive courts, which you can buy here.
But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the press, and most people this does not seem to care.
Here hates it, Anders Breivik still name - those racist extreme right, which last year 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it only refers to the "incident" on 22 July.
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peaceful country to such brutal murders is capable of.
The main responsibility for today ’ s wealth of Norway is since the early 1970 ’ s growth is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with seasoned Rakfisk distributed and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are a, as they say, sensible people.
Her English is like that of most people here spotless.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting.
Norway is dealt with very carefully with its oil wealth, a large part of the Branchenerträge is for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.
As in the years before the Great Depression cast all the money is that they do not, Norway had his wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we in the winter skiing and hiking can go in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course," Rakfisk eat, it deals with easy laughter.
I stand in the snow, I am for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
So a moose-burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat I enjoy.
But in the evening the Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several locations, the Rakfisk-organising a dinner, where guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish Geruchssinne can vote.
There is a Live-TV-circuit with fly to make television presenters, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"You have the score up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
Here are our points, "Amazing".
To applause and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the Chinese.
But perhaps it is but the strict haze of the whole fish.
