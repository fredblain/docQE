Birth in outer space 
Earth in danger. 
Global warming or collision with asteroid killer. 
By guiding caravans of ships with Erdbewohners on board in the search for a replacement planets. 
In order to save the human race, the important question is how we are in the catching or on the planets can breed? 
Many choices are not in my opinion. 
De facto, there are only two real planets, which we could inhabit at least hypothetical. 
"That is Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomical Vladimir Sternberg-Instituts Surdin. 
But while the conditions on Mars are comparatively benign, there is on the surface of Venus with a temperature of 500 degrees. 
Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, which is in space. 
The issue of reproduction in all of the researchers treated first with regard to the flora. 
As early as half a century before the experiments were carried out with plants. 
The fourth generation of peas produced in orbit is not the least of the species. 
It was followed by the breeding of insects, tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit. 
In 1979, leier sent into space to explore how the catching impacts on the development of embryos. 
It is becoming a normal chickens. 
But then the problem begins. 
"The problem is that the chickens must be found; it is on its feet and start to move," explained the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biology problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew. 
Without fixed underground the chicks beat. 
Ten hours later, stumpften the instincts of the newborn full. 
The chicks were not reacting to light and loud. 
Four days later, they simply died. 
"Twice we have chickens and then found the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew the failed experiment with the chicks in space. 
The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years into the orbit. 
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue. 
But the Biosatelliten "Bion" are only same-sex species. 
There was an experiment with rats, which had already been fertilised, were sent into space. 
In principle, it was found that there was nothing special. 
"It was just about the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only a single experiment, and research must be continued," said Vladimir Sychew. 
After the landing, the space rats were young. 
The issue of reproduction directly in space, it has not yet been resolved. 
The task is difficult. 
Animals, which are snatched from their natural habitat, can simply do not follow their reproduction. 
In contrast to human beings could in principle. 
Homo sapiens is able to abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background. 
For ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out. 
But women have been flying for 50 years at all. 
The greatest risk was Tereshkova. 
The most precious, humanity is the female organism. 
Our Möwe flew, and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is it the space flight? 
Will it after this flight can bring a child into the world? 
"After all, nobody answered this question," says space veteran guard tang Watschnadse. 
In June 1964, only a year after its space flight, bore the first female cosmonaut, vale Christina Tereshkova, a daughter. 
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut. 
In 1988 has given birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit, and even work outside of Raumfahrzeugs verrichtete, a son. 
However, there remains a risk. 
We have only very few Kosmonauts, where, after long flights it all went well, and they got healthy offspring. 
"The more, the more dangerous it is, even in flights to orbit," Kosmonaut Waleri Poliakov quite rightly concludes, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation. 
However, the human race for new ways of biotechnology, radiation protection and the Erzeugen artificial Gravitation. 
The Hydrolabor in the centre of Kosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight. 
Here in limbo the Kosmonauts routine for the work in open space. 
The water is catching. 
Even if adults feel comfortable, it is a strange environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element. 
It is as if the little Ichtyander testimony that life on the land towards the ocean. 
There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in amniotic, and that it may be easier to get used to water. 
In principle, this is logical, because from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks. 
"It is too little time to forget something," says children's swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa. 
As for a newborn child, the catching is a much more natural condition, the woman is not without gravity. 
In the state of catching the belly and muskulatur basin very quickly and it is also the ability to extract the child. 
Well, we deal with sending aid. 
For example, the birth could also take place in a Spezialkammer, in order to extract the baby. 
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poliakov quite rightly. 
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. 
Without the Erdanziehung feeling, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles. 
A newborn child cannot be in orbit as an adult for training will be put into a suit. 
He will simply miss what is crucial for his life. 
"This experiment, which we jointly, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will mean that we have a disabled person, a completely unangepaßt man in the world," says the head of the ethics committee of the Institute for medical and biology problems RAN, Igor Pestow. 
So far, the birth of children in outer space theory. 
At some point, but it will be a reality if the people in their space ships on a distant planet, which is the home for their offspring born in space.
