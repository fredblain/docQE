After the Appeal Court of the United States has confirmed a ruling that the restructuring of the debt of the group does not recognize Vitro, which has been reached on a trade konkurs in Mexico, is a sinister precedent for any national companies with operations in neighbouring countries, the payment problem. 
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies, which allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes in contradiction with international agreements have no validity. 
In practice on 15 June recognition of the ruling by the judge Harlin Hale on the court in Bancarrotas for the Northern District of Texas, the Mexican company the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river well done. 
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico the floodgates of three inconsistencies in the Supreme Court of the United States. 
While the judge in the case indicates that the creditors in the bankruptcy law must be subject to the United States, says the Appeal Court of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, first, that the main proceedings for the commercial konkurs are treated in Mexico. 
The first point would mean that international cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with national cross profile is not known. 
In fact, to this end, the model law of the United Nations created for the unification of international trade law, although the American Law Institute has been used as an arbiter. 
Secondly, the judgment certain that without the votes of the societies for recognition of the liabilities of the estate, which the branches of Vitro with their parent company had not achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debt. 
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws. 
Indeed, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved. 
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies) have been confirmed. 
It is also true that, after deducting the votes of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who are charged in the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergència, Elliot nacional and Liverpool Limited, had reached a majority. 
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent. 
This will not be taken into account by the Appeal Court. 
On the other hand, Vitro blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country beatings. 
For this reason the family González Sada before the same conflict with an appeals court, so that the vote in plenary session will take place, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them were voting on. 
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare-Einspruch, which calls for a review of the procedure by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
The most serious in this case is that the court had a document from the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) has been sent out, what the procedure carried out by Vitro is described in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, and what will be pointed out that we stick to the agreements signed by both countries, with the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law to comply with the United States. 
It also pointed out that the country the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equal treatment of debtors and creditors. 
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
