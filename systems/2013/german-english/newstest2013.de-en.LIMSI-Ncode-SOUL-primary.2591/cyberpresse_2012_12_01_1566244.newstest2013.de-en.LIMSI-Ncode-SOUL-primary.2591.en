The Higgs-Boson analysis 
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs-Bosons last summer, a certain sensation, and for good reason. 
In fact, that this Boson believes in nothing less than the mechanism for the mass of all objects in the universe is responsible. 
Finally, it is the last particle whose existence from the standard model - our best, or "least bad" explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter, predicted, but has not yet been empirically observed. 
But for physicists, it is still not entirely sure that it is really about the Higgs. 
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model is strong. 
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data this week have been presented at a major Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be completely safe. 
Nevertheless, let us suppose that it really is the Higgs, there seems to be only a small risk to deceive themselves, and we are looking at what is at stake. 
There is a necessarily inevitable law in this world, which means that two objects are not at the same time in the same place. 
It is not possible to violate this rule - and you do not try to strong, because you will be hurt. 
After all, even if the particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles are not the same room at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" and the "status quo" by and large, consists of some of their properties. 
On that basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories. 
In a corner, the good citizens, who are referred to as Fermione and the pauli principle. 
And in the other Bosonen, a sinister gang of anarchists, whom nothing is sacred - at least not this principle, which means that they are in fact at the same time in the same place. 
This Bosonen structure, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Mesonen, which we will not deal with here, and the "particles" through which the great forces of nature and it would be somehow related to the Higgs-Boson. 
It must be stressed, however, that these Bosonen are not all such exotic creatures, as you might think. 
If you have the ability to read this story, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the Photon or the "light particle," the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force. 
If a particle with an electric cargo or change the direction, the electromagnetic field is in this place "disrupted" like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond. 
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon and thus one of the Bosonen "winner of the force." 
Stable business field 
The same is true of the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs-Feld, must be "disrupted" so that this Boson shows. 
However, the Higgs-Feld is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus must achieve very high energy, a little comparable with a frozen pond, the surface of a very large rock could be zerfurcht. 
That is why it is a huge particle flurry as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 kilometers! - in order to achieve such energies. 
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. 
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field. 
Some people, such as the magnets used to do this, but others are not, for example, a piece of paper would never even in the refrigerator. 
And it also does not interact all particles with the Higgs-Feld: those who do have a mass, while others (like the Photon) have no mass. 
What all this research can now "be good," asks Mrs Plamondon? 
As for the science they serve the revision of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM precisely to investigate. 
There are, in fact, many physicists who sincerely hope that these differences will be found, because the slightest difference a door open to a "new physics" and could fill some holes in the model. 
It must be said that the latter still have major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the subject matter of the universe (once again ups!). 
However, such deviations from the CERN has so far not been found. 
Impact 
The effects of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no. 
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the bell labs are not believed that their work would trigger a similar revolution. 
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. 
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the lasers were invented in the 1960s, and in 1962 the first permanent bar lasers (were the first gepulst) has developed - has already said that the lasers at the beginning rather than a "laboratory" has been considered. 
Imagine... 
In addition, applications may also arise from all the instruments which surround the research. 
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the pulp with a small light sensor. 
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and gave him the Nobel Prize for physics. 
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you never really know...
