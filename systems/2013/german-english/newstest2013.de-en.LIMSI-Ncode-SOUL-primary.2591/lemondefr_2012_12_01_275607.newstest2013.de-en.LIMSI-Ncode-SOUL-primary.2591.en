Housing scandals in Quebec 
Officials of the Straßenbauamt, the bauhaupt industry companies, money providers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell us every day, which they have a great 'system' in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso. 
A "industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. 
"It is strange how the system is falling apart, since drastic measures have been taken," witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, MEP in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal. 
The scandal has been with him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the contracts for road works in Quebec, the former Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed. 
The "Duchesneau-Bericht" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and bribery of government officials. 
"Since the start of the study in 2010," he said, "would have been only the transport ministry saved a billion dollars in the Treaties," because some zügelten their instinct to get their share. 
The Charbonneau-Kommission "has already had two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it will be able to "identify the tactics behind the individuals." 
A 2011 set up permanent anti-corruption unit 
The 2011 set up permanent anti-corruption unit is doing with their troops to auditors, establish and analysts of the government too much effort. 
In addition, the police officers of the "mart au-truppe," which since 2009 has meant that the "sewage cartel" of Montreal in the artificial inflation of the Treaties more restrained... 
In the last few weeks has made it mass raids and accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard marc otte is the mayor of a suburb. 
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who is from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec, has resigned. 
He is suspected, in exchange for public contracts repeated bribes. 
I have been accused, in fact, engineers from the Straßenbauamt of Montreal, as well as Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. 
The latter has a sensation, giving the Commission the workings of the "system" for the maintenance of public contracts. 
He himself has several years of 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a paid agent in connection with the Mafia, the money to the European Union, Montreal gave the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay. 
Mr. Zambito was in the 2000s his hands throughout the game by more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals have been in power. 
He also confessed to illegal fund-raising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau organised. 
Drainage contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him 
In Montreal it worked the "system" of corruption smoothly. 
The former civil engineers Gilles Surprenant has described in detail before the Commission: ten years ago he received from the developers gifts, invitations to travel, Golf-Turnieren, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in excess of 736 000 dollars in exchange for drainage contracts, he artificially inflated their costs. 
Other officials of the Straßenbauamt have admitted that they could be insuring by invoices with false benefits artificially aufblähten at 30-40%. 
In addition, the organisers of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay accused that he has deliberately been ignored by a shadow budget, which filled its coffers with black money. 
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay in early November resigned, as Montreal plunged into a severe crisis. 
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, suggested the alarm. 
As the mayor of the city district Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, they rejected 2010 against the sale of municipal land for 5 million dollars and 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market has been sold. 
70% black money in election campaigns 
The study, which will be carried out in the end, she says that they "on a thread, which allows the functioning of the system to emigrate from carried to understand, in order to stop the evil, and expose the culprits." 
She says that the process of "painful but positive." 
We are going to clean up the wound, however, need an investigative unit for Montreal, as well as a supervision, in order to prevent a return of the questionable practices. 
How can we do clean. 
Regularly. 
Jacques Duchesneau, in turn, notes that "officials stole several hundred million dollars," but above all concerned about the role of the "agent of the tactic in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud. 
On the basis of a share of 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he witzelt: "I was told that this was only a weak copy of reality." 
The Quebec government proposes to restrict the donations to political parties to 100 dollars, which he said that nothing would change in the situation: "As long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in the policy." 
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the awarding of public contracts and the financing of political parties: "We cannot fall further; by things with courage on the bottom, the House on a more solid base with more controls and laws." 
If this story is the international reputation of Quebec and that damages from Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look in their own backyard...
