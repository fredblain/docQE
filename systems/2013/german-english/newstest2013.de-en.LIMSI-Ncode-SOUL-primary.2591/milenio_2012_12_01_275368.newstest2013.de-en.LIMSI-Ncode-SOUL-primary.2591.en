"South America must learn from the integration of its citizens," says Rafael Correa 
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, but "South America really can learn something from Europe." 
Correa, on the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was held in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans "in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing" and "today are practically a fatherland." 
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur drive. 
"It must be achieved on the free movement of citizens and workers in all Latin American countries, as is already in the Andean Community is the case; however, there are still reactionary sectors, which are seeking a return to the past," he warned. 
The president of Ecuador also supported the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA), under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and those to be taken into account, the San José Agreement signed on human rights. 
The teaching, never to commit to something, and in return, we will sign the South Americans everything. 
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights based in Washington, and financed by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has granted. 
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not have betrayed his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights." 
He added that there was "well-founded suspicions that Assange extradited to a third country, and his trial would not be complied with." 
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which he asked for it on its territory to undergo interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish law allows this through a video conference on the Ecuador Embassy in London could be carried out." 
Correa said that the danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be compromised. 
"Since then he has been in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but it is not serious," said the head of state of Ecuador. 
However, there was a danger that he took physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a narrow space, and no physical exercises carried out in the open air. 
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added. 
Correa was that the solution to the asylum, Assange since the month of June in the Ecuador Embassy in London has been granted, the granting of a Freibriefs, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that this in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London, in order to find a solution for the jailed founder of WikiLeaks. 
We do not act with human rights, this word in this case, we are not, however, there have been constant discussions. 
"The solution to this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, balt azar Garzón, is conducting a series of procedures on various European institutions," he said. 
"If the UK morning granted this licence, I believe that this is done." 
And if Sweden Mr. Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London or on Skype up and interrogated, as the Swedish law allows and has been made in other cases, the problem is resolved. 
Correa took the opportunity to confirm as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate, "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies are denied the freedom of expression." 
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail," he said. 
In this sense he is happy that Ecuador is no longer such journalists "and not the bankers or hegemon and civic countries dominated," and, at the outset that he is in a re-election "will deepen the revolution, in order to continue the way in the right direction." 
Correa also supported the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain tough and no opportunism and no legal disguised coup d'etat" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay." 
The president of Ecuador is also the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and following the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which announced the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua to negotiate the seerechtlichen border between the two countries, for "absolutely justified." 
At present, this judgment will not be implemented. 
It is a problem between a Southern and a Central American state. 
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be in the quest for a common path to be overcome. 
They must be dealt with comprehensively, so that they can be overcome and can look forward. 
He also relied on a good deal of the disputes over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to take recourse to international bodies, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh." 
With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador is to achieve his third mandate in a row, he gave this possibility "with much optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult." 
Correa promised that if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life. 
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. 
"My political movement had the belief that I was guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfil this responsibility," he said. 
If I could win, it would be my last term as president, then I am withdrawing from public life. 
This is also true when we lose. 
"This is decided," he said. 
Correa also referred to the handling of the health problems faced by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. 
I have just been with the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he has told me that he is a planned, routine treatment have travelled there, and that would be expected that after the election campaign could once again travel to Cuba. 
"It is in no way a relapse into the health of President Chavez," he commented. 
The Ecuadorean leader was today in Lima on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security.
