The cause of death for AIDS is now too late to identify 
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result: HIV positive. 
"It was as if a bombshell," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken." 
He hid it from his family. 
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to inform, and this with such dedication that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. 
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV-Einheit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he after several battles in 1994. 
Fabrizio is living with the human immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years, which began in the 1990s was hard to imagine when many doubts, few treatments and more stigma. 
At the time, it has avoided even the director of a clinic in IMSS, "because it led to a dead end." 
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death. 
Today, it is possible to have this syndrome with life to survive. 
However, there are still many people in the clinic, who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already caused harm, and their immune system has outlived its usefulness, and are the victims of opportunistic infections. 
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up the treatment in good time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV-Einheit of HCG, Jaime Andrade villa nueva, and he said that this information in April this year had been supported by a respected scientific publication. 
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade villa nueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 inferred that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of the degree of impairment of the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that the greater opportunities, which are not drugs: up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4. 
Simply put, the above mean that anyone at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis is HIV positive, in this sense, "easily can be 75 years old, as long as he is under control," the expert said. 
In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans now average 76 years. 
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS, from 6 678 cases in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), but it is true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients have died in the national database. 
Only in Jalisco in 2011 255 people died, and until May of this year, there have been 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 universal access to anti-retroviral drugs. 
- Why, then, are still dying? 
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment. 
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. 
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no problems with the drugs, but the problem is that the people in advanced condition, because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in very late stages of the disease. 
He makes a powerful statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, timely manner diagnoses are needed, and that is why all people, where it is needed, massive screening tests should be offered." 
This proposal will agree with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (National Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio to conduct its test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason, because it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS stage, and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications. 
Everything is different when you know that you're AIDS. 
Some people think that they are going to die, and do not want to hear. 
"If I have been going to die, then three times burst," one says in my case. 
The amendment was designed to improve, I am well ernähre, sport and take the medication. 
Today, his parents only know that he has cancer. 
I live a normal life, like everyone else. 
"I am doing a lot, I have an active, but Sexleben, I am on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio has agreed to share intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, with his testimony to encourage those who are now in the context of the global AIDS Day. 
They should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group, but the sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how all people can live responsibly. 
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. 
Condoms behind the counter 
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, there are big holes, said Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV. 
And the most important thing is prevention. 
In certain places "has actually increased the distribution of condoms; they were previously issued, they now give us packages with one hundred piece, which is a good thing, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said. 
At the risk of new infections among young people. 
"Why do you need?" is a question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and on the health care system, the young people do not want to suspend, assured the correspondent. 
He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but spending in public toilets, which are often visited by young people. 
It is not for the promiscuity to be promoted. 
They should not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the Governor Emilio González replied to the question whether condoms will be distributed under his administration. 
"Sexuality is not enough; it is the best condoms to bring those who already have a sexual activity," he has brought it to the point. 
Key details of Jalisco 
There are 13 435 cumulative cases (12 158 AIDS and 1 317 HIV). 
The state is seen in 4th place of new and kumulierter AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV. 
92% of infection occur on sexual intercourse, 6% of the blood and 2% flourishing atal. 
It is estimated that 50 000 people living with HIV, because for every registered case 4 or 5 people, who do not know it.
