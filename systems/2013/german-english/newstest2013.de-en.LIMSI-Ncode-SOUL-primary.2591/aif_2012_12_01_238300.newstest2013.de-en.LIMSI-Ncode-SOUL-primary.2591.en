"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language 
While MPs and human rights activists discuss what benefits the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals are already taking action with counterfeit certificates 
Every year, 13 million migrant workers in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities. 
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. 
Their only goal is to pay for the upkeep of the remaining families in the country to earn money. 
On 1 December, a law entered into force, according to which every working immigrant is a test of knowledge of the Russian language. 
So far this arrangement applies only to migrants in the services sector, in the local housing economy and want to work in the retail sector. 
But the tests with the federal immigration agency in the future for all migrant workers on duty. 
It is not only the language tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation. 
Languages need both for the preservation and the extension of work permits will be proven. 
The exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian language is. 
Also excluded from this law are people who have their educational certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991. 
And protection of human rights 
The entirety of the audit will be under the aegis of the puschkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of friendship among the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg Staatlichen University and other Russian universities. 
The migrants will be able to take the tests in all the cities; already in Russia have already opened more than 160 such centers. 
The initiative to introduce the tests was made by the members of the State Duma and supported the federal immigration authority. 
Human rights activists, however, came before the entry into force of the law in the press on several occasions the following question: what does it actually mean? 
What changes is the rule, language skills, both for the Russians and for the migrant workers? 
Above all, from spokesman for the immigration authority, it seeks to reduce the number of forced labourers. 
"Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representation of the federal immigration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew. 
Their rights, however, must be protected before their departure. 
Only an organised recruitment will result in 90% solve the problems of foreign workers. 
On the problems facing migrants without jobs, education, language skills and medical evaluation. 
Sebelew is convinced that a future without language skills will meet people with bad intentions, which put him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow cabin, where he met with dozens of his peers months without food and documents left and 12 to 14 hours a day work. 
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants. 
"In the home, you are the one promised, and you will be cheated at the arrival, get their passports confiscated and do not receive the promised wages," confirmed the head of the main management of labour migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow. 
It is not moaning, boss! 
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, that they not only do not speak the language of the destination, but also in their own language hardly can express in writing. 
Of course, this is not so much their guilt, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only make a sound basic education. 
After all, in their families, there are still not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy decent clothes, shoes and school matters. 
As a teenager to take these children then immediately the first opportunity to earn money. 
"It is difficult without language," she admits. 
"You humiliated and inferior." 
Human rights activists stress the important aspect of the law. 
According to the test, only migrants with legal status. 
Do you not do this status, there is no scrutiny and therefore no official work. 
Meanwhile, the bulk of migrant workers remains illegal in Russia. 
"Welcome" or "access to banned" 
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia. 
The reason is bureaucratic and, of course, the linguistic problems. 
Moreover, the legalisation will cost: 12 to 16 thousand rubles. 
A fake registration can be found quickly, and only for one and a half thousand. 
The staff of the Russian police are aware that our documents largely falsified and we are not registered, and then arise from cases of blackmail. 
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajiks Umed Huschkadamow against journalists. 
"But spare no costs for false papers." 
Back in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified. 
Some counterfeit certificates, which besch some of the language tests, were employees of the federal immigration agency. 
The fake papers have been printed with an ordinary colour printer. 
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant, who hoped to be able to stop the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. 
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this will cost a migrant worker three thousand rubles. 
The most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and human rights activists agree. 
For the moment, the authorities can immigrant workers, who are covered by the test for the first time, just promise that time for a language course. 
In addition, newcomers without language posts offered in areas where no active consultation with people is necessary.
