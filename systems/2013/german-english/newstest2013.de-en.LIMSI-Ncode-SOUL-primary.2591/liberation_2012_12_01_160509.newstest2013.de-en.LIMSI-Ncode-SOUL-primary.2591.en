A constitution with a sledgehammer in Egypt 
We are talking about a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi. 
While Egypt in terms of the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily granted the unlimited power, more than ever, remains divided, he has decided to put everything on a card. 
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly on the next day will adopt its final version. 
In just a week, the leader of the House had two extra months for the completion of its work. 
Egypt is building now for almost two years on an interim, amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess. 
This new initiative has only ensured an even stronger division of the country. 
As far as his opponents remained the president in his "autocratic frenzy" by continuing to "break his word" and "the right underfoot." 
On behalf of his supporters to be assured that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process. 
In the space of 14 days, a referendum should be held. 
A very short period, forcing the brothers to dispense with their project, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section. 
For the President, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging throughout the country. 
After excess, in an interview with the American weekly Time Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably. 
With the Egyptian people with this resort to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either is true to her for my draft or I reserve the unlimited powers," the latter should end after adoption of the Constitution. 
85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere. 
The majority of the Liberal Democrats has not complied with the request. 
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they were turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into account. 
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally. 
In order to achieve the quorum, yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members added. 
Some people are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. 
It is not surprising that the articles were usually unanimously adopted. 
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... the time has come for the prayer, because some members of the panel were of the opinion that the Pendeluhr of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate. 
The text, which has not yet been adopted last night, consists of 234 articles. 
Article 2, which drew all the attention, after all, is identical to that of the constitution since 1971 and says that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law." 
The salafis parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope that "the principles" by "the rules" to replace a stricter application would have made possible. 
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed, a proof of their good will and for their respect to the other members of the Egyptian society. 
"Hypocrisy" of the liberals, who see only as propaganda. 
After all, according to them is the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles. 
In particular they have in mind, Article 220 of the Al-Azhar University gives an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of the conformity with the laws of Sharia law. 
According to the Ã„gypten spezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because " the people who are being asked for an opinion, are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. 
You can see the first signs of a theocracy." 
The fears of the Liberal Democrats are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of the university is far less likely to be more moderate than the present. 
"At the moment there is no specific religious commitment. 
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state. 
Most lawyers, who have been working on this text, are not Ulema, but academics, many of whom have been trained in the French system," soothed Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. 
But he admits," that in relation to Article 220 may be an ambiguity, because the terms are borrowed from the religious vocabulary. 
It is here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence Red.]. 
Moreover, the question could be raised in future, whether civilian courts are competent to decide." 
Apart from its religious aspect, it is the last text strongly criticised because of the far-reaching powers he granted to the President of the Republic. 
The Muslim Brotherhood argued that they compared with the former regime are significantly reduced. 
Another sticking point: the powers of the army. 
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget was not submitted to Parliament, but a National Defence Council. 
Similarly, there is no prohibition of civil proceedings in military commissions, as the groups have called for the defence of human rights. 
The latter also share their concerns with regard to the text of which they see as threatening freedom. 
The offence of blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now banned, with serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press. 
In addition, no longer refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch. 
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36. 
This word was not included in the previous constitution. 
While the Egyptian president last night had to speak out on the television, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon. 
The supporters of the head of state will demonstrate Saturday.
