Every day you drink butter - and will be 168 years old 
In the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a biblical age. 
There is even a museum for longevity. 
A search in the country in which 97 people are still comparatively young.

A search in the country in which 97 people are still comparatively young. 
The journey through the Talysch-Gebirge is romantic. 
The Kleinbus rumpelt on the road over densely wooded hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses. 
Everything is green and juicy, you might think that you would have been in the Black Forest. 
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few miles away. 
This is the Caucasian population of Talyschen, which is not much known, except that it speaks perfect Persian, as well as Aserisch and is very durable. 
Destination is Lerik. 
The small city flaunts powerful architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape. 
Tourists from Europe hardly come here is too onerous for the journey from Azerbaijan capital, Baku. 
For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours, because the road is only a single track. 
The fabulous wealth that the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived in the province. 
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik is the stuff of tourist attraction. 
"Baku was in May with the eurovision song festival famous - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says. 
She is the director of the museum for longevity, is probably the only one in the world. 
Here is the Vita of approximately eight dozen Talyschen from the area documented more than 100 Fatulayeva shows on a black-and-white photo. 
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. 
In the age of 136 years, a child conceived 
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, 168 years old. 
A birth certificate, however, does not exist. 
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful. 
"1805 here he was born in the region, and in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explained. 
The man has been married three times and have 23 children, at the age of 136 years ago, he is still a daughter. 
Has irali Müslümov in his age for a few decades? 
But Rembrandt Scholz, senior researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut in Rostock, has heard from the very elderly - in Central Asia. 
"What is striking, there are also many hochaltrige people in some areas of China, in Japan or in Hunza-Tal in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men." 
In the absence of documentation, however, is not a scientific proof of the age, particularly because civil records were missing. 
Every day becher melted butter 
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik is remarkably often a biblical age. 
At present there are 20 people who are older than 100 years old. 
So why are so many Hochbetagte in the south? 
The Azeri leader Farid Mugimzadeh said that with the particular genes of the Talyschen. 
Museum director Fatulayeva, however, believes that it is up to the diet. 
But the high-calorie diet of Talyschen is to be healthy, meat, bread and, above all, love dairy products, and many of them every day and drink a glass melted butter, seems to be dietary not plausible. 
Or is it the original lifestyle, which keeps the people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva. 
In its 97 years for these regions it is still comparatively young. 
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, live in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region. 
It sits on the ground with a butter barrels before they tirelessly and herrollt. 
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents. 
Even two toddlers jump around. 
The kitchen is preparing the tea, which will be served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu-Gläsern. 
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in form and link, under her headscarf, her long, dark blond remained, her son proudly unveiled before us. 
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they were never told me and kept their colour. 
"Shampoo I have never been used," Mirzayeva says. 
Monthly pension is enough for life 
She has always eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. 
My entire life I have not once bought in the supermarket food. 
Then they were told by her husband in the army. 
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War. 
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew, took the helm. 
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman. 
But the cult, which is being driven by the father figure of the nation, which his country ruled as a dictator, knows little borders in Azerbaijan. 
Until 2003 he was in power, who later took his son Ilham the helm. 
After all, there is no hardship among Azerbaijan elderly people. 
230 Manat (roughly the same amount in euros), will receive Mirzayeva monthly pension, for a sum here, of which you can live well. 
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long grey son right: "Old people enjoy respect in our culture." 
They live in the middle of the big family, to be loved, cared and are happy. 
If this is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive
