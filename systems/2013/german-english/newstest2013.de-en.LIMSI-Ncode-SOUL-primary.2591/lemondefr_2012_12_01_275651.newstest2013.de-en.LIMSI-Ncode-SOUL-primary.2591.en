"PSG is not FC Barcelona!" 
In this season, you have with PSG a new scale. 
How do you explain this progress? 
You can see it through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG. 
Wonderful players are here. 
Every day I am making progress on their side. 
The technical staff gave me too much. 
These factors spur me on a daily basis, to improve my game levels. 
And in a game that is even easier. 
In football, everything is going very quickly. 
But I must stop enthusiasm. 
Since my early days at the centre of the preparatory training of INF claire fontaine to my playing time in St etienne, I have always made gradual progress. 
They make up the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.... 
The newcomers this summer are accustomed to a very high level. 
You also know that every training unit is crucial. 
This means that a player like me, and his best wishes. 
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my playing position. 
He will Co-Trainern support such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. 
Ancelotti is the right person for the job? 
Of course. 
Ancelotti gives all people respect a. 
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is among the best coaches of Europe. 
He has a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs. 
He has had contact with big players. 
I think that he will win another title in Paris. 
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him. 
At that time, I was just recovering from an injury. 
The confidence that he has put in me is also an explanation for my performance. 
What do you think about the first part of the season for PSG? 
In the Ligue 1 Lyon gave us the place of the front-runner. 
We lurk in the ambush. 
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the advanced semi-finals in this way. 
What is the objective of the club in this competition? 
We are going to try to get as far as possible. 
From now on, everything is possible. 
However, we are going to be against very good European teams that we will have their say. 
First, we want to start our group in Porto, so that the return leg of the semi-finals advanced as a home game. 
PSG is a major European club in the short term? 
He has already had the budget for it.... 
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win the title and make a name over the long term. 
This is not the case today. 
In financial terms, the PSG the means to ensure that this project takes concrete forms. 
Would it be a great failure, not the title of the Ligue 1 to win, as was the case in the last season? 
Of course, this would be a great disappointment. 
This year, we are really keen to cream off this title. 
In the last season, we were close off. 
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory. 
We ended the season with a very strong performance. 
We have finished with 79 points. 
Normally, it should be with 79 points to be master... 
But another team, those of Montpellier, has reached an even better season. 
I believe that this year is the right one. 
Even though the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are vying for the title, I believe that we have the stuff to win it. 
Do you think that the media can expect a lot from PSG? 
Given what has been invested, and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us. 
We fully accept that. 
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and there is still something you can accuse us, which is certainly a bit frustrating. 
One wonders what people expect. 
We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win. 
We are not FC Barcelona! 
We are trying to set up a game plan. 
One team builds itself with the time. 
In the Champions League, we have strength shown. 
Look at Manchester City, a club for the last two seasons and included fails to qualify for the advanced semi-finals and also a huge expense. 
In terms of the invested money, it was believed to break with 15 points ahead. 
This would mean that our opponents and the French schaft ignored. 
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were of this new "geboostet" PSG. 
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. 
I hope that we will be in May of the smiling victor and tell us that we have won, despite all the difficulties, after all. 
The PSG seems completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 
So much better that we talk about a "zlatan addiction." 
In other words, that Ibrahimovic is powerful and too many doors. 
This is why he has arrived, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. 
Everywhere, where he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star. 
Within the team, we respect both the players and the person. 
He also respected the people who saw him surrounded. 
What he has done is really extraordinary. 
This encourages others to improve their own levels. 
Thiago Silva, the world is one of the best defenders, making it possible for all the others to make progress. 
As you have the Euro 2012 experience with the French national team? 
It is a disappointment. 
It was close to my heart at this European Championships. 
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing time. 
I have things seen from which I am stronger. 
Today, it is possible for me to achieve good matches in the national team. 
This has been since my start with the "Bleus" my hope. 
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour. 
What do you have for the first six months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"? 
He has achieved promising results. 
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup. 
The national coach is strict, it is close to the players, and suggests the victory. 
It was also Laurent Blanc. 
But I would not make a comparison. 
Blanc had achieved his goal by making us qualified for the European Championships. 
I hope that Didier Deschamps, the "Bleus" will lead to Brazil. 
Is the forced draw on 16 October in Spain (1:1) an address? 
This game has given us confidence. 
Everyone has worked for everyone else. 
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
