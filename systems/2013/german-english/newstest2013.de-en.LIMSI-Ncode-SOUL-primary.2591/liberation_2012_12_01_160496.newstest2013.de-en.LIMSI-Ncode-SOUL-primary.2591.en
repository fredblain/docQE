We are withdrawing from Afghanistan. 
And after that? 
French troops have their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). 
NATO and the United States should follow suit at the end of 2014. 
It is time that the Afghan army is taking back the property of their territory, and that the Afghan people will decide their future without anything to expect from us. 
We have particularly punished the Afghan farmers by we have seen them as terrorists. 
And even with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and mutilated. 
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders, who have fled to Pakistan, but also often from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets. 
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks. 
Does, sometimes backed by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries are more subtly. 
The withdrawal of French troops from the outpost in Nijrab, which I watched from a hill planted with almond trees, using the French loans has been financed, has been carried out properly. 
The überflogenen trucks and armored konvois of helicopters have Kabul, without being attacked. 
From the end of 2014, there will be no Einströmen more than the Taliban in Kabul. 
Since its irresistible march from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed. 
At the time Kabul was empty and the country because of the struggles of the various rebel groups from the war. 
Their arrival was seen as a kind of liberation and return to security. 
The Afghan women have the price of the obscurantism of the al-Qaeda organization overthrew farmers paid for, but their situation has still not improved. 
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position. 
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war are back to power. 
They have turned into traders by land seized by the government, as construction of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell and benefit from the massive American subcontracting. 
They have been discredited, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting. 
As I have heard in the campaign, people want a government that is not composed of thieves. 
Many young people want to leave the country, such as those who have been able to make the American contributions to use: capital flight is considerable. 
The young people have the war and its ideologies. 
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have made contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed their benefits. 
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, and a fifth of the total population. 
In the cities, state schools full of girls and boys. 
This is a young man, not the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders want to return, there will be jobs available. 
Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; the television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, will be seen everywhere. 
An army is now there. 
Will the authorities under which authority it will be considered legitimate? 
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already seeking the restoration of the militias in the province, which will take away the power of the central government. 
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities would benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation in the case of the Western nations, but by abolishing the post of prime minister, which has been in existence since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralised state with a strong presidential power. 
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, particularly during the elections scheduled for April 2014. 
However, it is his country since the 1950s and has long been dependent on foreign aid. 
Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning power stations are non-existent and important irrigation systems have not been repaired. 
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced. 
The private initiative will be a priority. 
In a country which has been devastated by 30 years of war, would be a state control of the infrastructure needed. 
The rumour was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources. 
This further strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, in order to conquer it. 
Without energy, in order to process the iron or Kupfererz on the ground, or without transport for the export of the mountains, no mining is possible. 
The Chinese have the copper mine has been almost abandoned by Mes Aynak, the international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the vast Buddhist site make their digs and remain the main employer in the province. 
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely one and exports depend, to restore normal relations. 
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November. 
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young gymnasien, Institute for French universities, very institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sector, in support of the archaeological delegation. 
Since 2009, a service "civilian-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which has been halted in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages in numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation, in order to try to win hearts and summon " and the impossible task of the compatibility of assistance and proactive actions to achieve. 
This work, for which many local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and improvement of agricultural land. 
What souvenir we leave after military spending of two billion euros? 
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions, often at a level of more than 2 000 metres the valleys are very hard. 
In the message, there are dozens of written questions of small agricultural projects undertaken by local authorities in the province of Kapisa. 
If the farmers get rid of the rebellion led by foreign groups, and their desire for their own statements, would be the continuation of low, well controlled and directly affecting civilian aid to their advantage.
