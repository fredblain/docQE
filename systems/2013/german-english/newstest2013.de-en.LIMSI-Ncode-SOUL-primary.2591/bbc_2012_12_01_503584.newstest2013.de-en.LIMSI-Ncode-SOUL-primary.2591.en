Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start 
While Mexico President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his arrival, Will Grant from the BBC the forthcoming challenges and the mixed feelings of its people. 
At present, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad. 
Even in better days, this is a always congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel erected several important transport routes in the capital, absperrt, and on the streets for chaos. 
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but also to prevent protesters reaching Parliament. 
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto, the presidential binde and the leadership of the nation. 
He faces a complex task. 
Under the outgoing government, Felipe Calderon's economic Mexico has been able to work well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which in the last six years has cost 60 000 lives. 
"My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office to the US President Barack Obama. 
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal. 
Before he went to the US president on an equal footing, was Pena Nieto as governor of his home State of Mexico. 
In this densely populated, vast part of the country, which surrounds the capital, are the different views on the new head of state. 
A direct man 
In the remote town del Valle bravo, for example, is remembered fondly of him. 
Residents of the tourist location write to him, the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure. 
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways, Pena Nieto and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads, which it once was. 
Badges with his name are also outside of a modern sports centre and a powerful interactive museum on climate change. 
"We expect real and lasting changes," his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI is working. 
In particular, as regards the security and economy, we look forward to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. 
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000, replaced by Vicente Fox. 
The Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. 
The accusations made by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects. 
He is a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country. 
He was a great statesman, above all, but he is also someone who can listen to me. 
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor. 
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could contrast to the paved streets of Valle del bravo not be greater. 
The place is hidden under motorway führungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself. 
And the problems in the municipality are of crucial urban nature. 
At the beginning of this year, the military intervened to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. 
In a spot fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill, in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens murdered women left behind. 
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, killed more than 1 000 women in Mexico state - a statistic that even the city Ciudad Juarez, which for its violence and the killings of innocent women is notorious. 
The Pena Nietos critics are of the view that he is the problem of feminicide during his term at least, is not adequately addressed. 
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem. 
In a Betonbau, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia is wrestling with the tears when she photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows. 
The official version of events, according to Mariana 2010, has committed suicide. 
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner. 
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," remembers Senora Buendia. 
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body had already been deployed. 
While her mother tells her story, gazing from the wall a picture of Mariana down to us, but it is appropriate, in addition to a cross, which bears a single word: justice. 
But this is precisely what the family have been denied until now. 
The authorities have treated me when I was a Schwätzerin, Nörglerin. 
They want their judgment simply accepted and shut up. 
"But it is not possible if there were so many flaws and omissions," she says. 
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday receives the presidential binde so that he is also assuming a great responsibility. 
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been in the last six years of violent crimes, and the new president has promised, during his tenure, particularly in order to deal with this problem. 
"I hope he is as president, as he as governor was," says the PRI-Kongressabgeordnete Olvera in Valle del bravo. 
But is afraid the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most.
