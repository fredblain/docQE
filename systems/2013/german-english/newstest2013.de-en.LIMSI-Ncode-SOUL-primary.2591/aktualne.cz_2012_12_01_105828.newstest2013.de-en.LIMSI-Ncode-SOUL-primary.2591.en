NKÚ-Chef: control of the black market system failed by fault of politics 
The Czech Republic, in connection with public procurement of good controllers and adequate laws, but falls in their application. 
In the conversation for Aktuáln, cz says that the vice-president of the Board of Control (Nejvyí kontrolní úad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala. 
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case," Kala commented on the current situation. 
A similar outcome is apparently also a joint control by Czech and German investigators. 
As a negative example of how practical it brings the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne?as to the so-called "black system." 
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls, the system is now prohibited or permitted? 
"A law is valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not easy for the government chairman, and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is an obstacle in his work," Kala notes. 
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint tschechisch-deutsches project, in which the laws of both countries were compared with each other in terms of public contracts. 
What was specific? 
It is a parallel examination, with which we started about two years ago. 
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature decides how to handle public contracts, and that is what we are building on the national legislation and, finally, there is the actual practical application. 
This is all we have compared with each other, and although the test is not yet complete, we saw very interesting differences, generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a little "more severe and perfect," the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better. 
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more precise rules, but we must also deal with the actual application of the law. 
How can you help? What is for you from this project? 
It is such a common control could help that we stop, we are constantly perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this does not seem particularly positive. 
Economics is one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment, or even criminal acts. 
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal. 
Perhaps it is even the case that the system in this way only with excessive "red tape" burden, and those who are looking for the gaps in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds were higher. 
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law. 
How does the control system in Germany? 
Is there a similar body like our NKÚ, or the system works differently? 
As far as the authorities are concerned, it is the German equivalent to the NKÚ of the Federal Audit Office, which is similar to us, and also has a college, which will be formed only slightly different, but both authorities in principle are similar. 
The powers are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is a federal state, which means that these bodies are also in the individual Länder - the German system differs from ours. 
The BRH can only control federal funds, which is in line with our state funds. 
Public funds, which are administered by the districts and municipalities, where they are subject to the control of the provincial Courts. 
As far as the German legislation is concerned, which is easier than ours? 
In general, I would hesitate to compare without specific details, but nevertheless, Germany is in some ways often described as a model, but we certainly cannot say that Germany is better at all. 
Is it perhaps because that is where the auditors are better? 
It is not certain, but as I said, such comparisons, I may not be very happy. 
It is also important to note that even those countries which are a model for us, also have to contend with problems. 
Otherwise, they would have nothing to do with cooperation with our authority, not true? 
With regard to the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority the revision of the procurement law, you have any impact? 
Given that this revision is in force only a short time, it is in our tests yet. 
Since our inspections take place, you need to be here with a certain delay. 
We feel so far more in the preparatory phase of future controls - as we have the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14 000 public contracts examined and analysed, the changes will have an impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions have been modified for certain types of contracts, etc. 
Do you think the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will be burdened with more bureaucracy? 
I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that confirms this assumption. 
It can occur, however, the problem is that the rules will be "tougher" and can no longer be met. 
Under the previous rules, an audit unterzogenen individuals in relation to the winner (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) accountable, that any breach of the law on public procurement is tantamount to a violation of budgetary discipline. 
Does it make sense to make the law more rigorous? 
I do not think that in this way. 
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse, and not punish a procedural mistake, which did not impact on the actual decisionmaking process. 
Such a system requires only bureaucracy under even greater pressure. 
Where is the way out? 
Let us start by which way is not effective. 
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs are not in control of the so-called "black market system" would reform - what exactly does that mean? 
If the system is now banned or permitted? 
A law is valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not simply the government chairman and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is an obstacle in his work. 
He can say: "We change the law and allow the matter," but he cannot say that we are doing so as if nothing would be. 
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is also true for the protection of public competition. 
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidders with the best offer alone will be excluded because of procedural errors. 
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is what I think is missing.
