The MVRDV architects show that the real adventure is not only in mind - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created book - 2 photos 
"I find the building fun, it looks futuristic, and once again there is something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a Passantin at the roadside. 
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby farm, says: "But it is nice, the house." 
But I wonder why we still need a library. 
They all have the Internet, iPad and electronic books. 
No one is still voluntary in one of these Old-Style-Bibliotheken, or? 
Spijkenisse, a little survey sleeping town before the Rotterdams doors, is an odd record holder. 
The 80 000 inhabitants municipality has the lowest rate in the entire Netherlands. 
In order to counteract this unfortunate circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to education and the seven imaginary bridges, which are described in the notes, a handsome bepinselt de Stahlbetonminiaturen. 
The success of the education campaign has remained in check. 
And so the city fathers realized that there were only one way of statistics: a library! 
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV architectural office, master of the audacity Balkenende diagramme and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared on the competition hearing in 2003 with five books at arm and a grin on the face. 
And while the jury looked bewildered and while 'perspiration' zuckte, stapelte of the impudent Maas his fine Mitbringsel the size of a pyramid and ended his aktionistisch speech with the words: "Love urban community." 
This is, therefore, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called boeke mountains. 
Nine years later, the 30 million euros. 
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground car park, supermarket, postal services and a few adjacent homes and houses with a total of 50 homes. 
In early November, with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012" excellent. 
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award nomination in 2012. 
This is the faceless small town retorte, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, whose white facades would be inclined to suggest a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture. 
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. 
The long road to the book 
The first impression: eldorado under glass. 
There is a lift to the middle of massive mountain, but the real space and happiness in the fußläufig climbing the topography. 
The strengthened compartment is bright and clear, the klinke bed and the elegant street taking unambiguously speak the language of a public city centre. 
The urban atmosphere is perfect. 
It is already looking for dog and football playing boys and Mädels. 
And, everywhere, books, books, books. 
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle, there is a large, dark space that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas. 
We have the classic konfiguration upside down and the reading of externally imposed. 
The interior of the bergs book is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technology center. 
A special pleasure is the black bookshelves, verkleidung, Brüstung, stieg. 
Pulp, Haptik and smell are alien. 
Even die-hard architects and Bauingenieure shake of the unknown material the head. 
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trouborst, project manager for the local community Spijkenisse, to question the standard. 
And so we are in a friesländischen farming one day on a suitable by-product from agriculture. 
For many years, they used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields, a millimeterdünnes plastic vlies as a root canal. 
This is cheap and efficient. 
The dünne textile holds a two Saisonen, then it is ripe for the Sperrmüll. 
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - about four centimetres thick plates. 
Under heat and pressure textbooks are the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) into a dark, homogeneous, resilient material, which is a bissl for new cars and a bissl smells like sports shoes. 
After 105 stages, we reached the summit. 
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long schaft will be in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also rewarded with Dutch Krokettes and eingetopft Ficusbäumen. 
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the right air humidity in the mountains. 
Donations for the new soul 
"You would not believe, but this House is, despite the many glass spaces a flagship project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says. 
It will be Geheizt and chilled with geothermal energy. 
Although the book is under a glass crash, the sun shines, even on sunny days only briefly in the home. 
The broad Holzleimbinder, which are all on the outside glass, serve as a Beschattung and catch a large part of the sun. 
The climate is very pleasant. 
The rest get automatically built. 
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT sector, have already dared the way into the new library. 
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there. 
And Cynthia TCM-Lehrerin Bogarde, the boeke mountain as a Spijkenisses "long overdue soul." 
The reason: in order to open up a few weeks ago, each resident has been invited to donate a book from his personal stock. 
This should start the optical gaps in the not yet fully library - currently 70 - will be filled. 
The concept is good enough. 
The shelves are filled by obenhin. 
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas. 
"I think that, thanks to our invitation has now all residents to have a certain relationship with this new home. 
Everyone knows that his books are part of this building. 
And if it is only for grace. 
This MVRDV has been the central discipline in jargon called identity. 
Spijkenisse has literary history written. 
That is how young and uneducated it may be. 
This is at last a starting point for identity.
