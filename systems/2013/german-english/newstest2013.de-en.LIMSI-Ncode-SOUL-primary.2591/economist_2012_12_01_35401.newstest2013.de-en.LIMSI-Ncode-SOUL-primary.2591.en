The old, new in the Middle East 
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for the peace process 
Can it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? 
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud. 
Amid the usual recriminations, countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. 
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians trapped in their historic conflict, appear to be changing the Middle East around them. 
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want to or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. 
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. 
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally reach its end. 
A war that is neither lost nor won 
At first glance, it seems optimistic in view of the current situation is anything but appropriate. 
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week's clashes have strengthened the Hartgesottenes on both sides. 
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement, which has controlled the Gaza Strip, will claim that the Israelis have diminished, even though his group itself has seen huge losses. 
Although a number of Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolat and dense bevölkert corners of the planet will be packed, Israel has so far not been able to destroy Hamas. 
In fact, Hamas in the West Bank, which the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah will be controlled. 
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side. 
For example, as Islamists have gained in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and rich friends on their side. 
Turkey, a resurgent regional power, which was once seen as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. 
Jubelnde Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly more Islamist Stürzung Bashar's could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king. 
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the world's largest and most important Arab country - on Israel's southern flank has changed the balance of the region. 
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his ouster in 2011 30 years, had little time left for Hamas. 
By contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and its leaders more dependent on public opinions. 
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded. 
The Israeli hardliners, however, make an opposite conclusion. 
Militarily speaking, Hamas is not a threat. 
The Israeli missile defence system, the "Iron Dome," has been able to prove its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. 
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more easily. 
In diplomatic terms the United States remain steadfast in its position, but many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest Gewalteskalationen. 
Israel is well handed down in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process largely ignored. 
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004 have killed around 30 Israelis, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the security wall has, in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared unconstitutional, but always be further developed. 
Netanyahu is good, and his Likud Party has been in the runup to the elections on 22 January, with Avigdor Lieberman allied with a kämpferisch group. 
Why is this insidious nanny Palestinians and give them a separate state? 
If they really control over the West Bank, then they would not be just as their supporters in the Gaza Strip, including the firing rockets? 
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish, they should not dare to raise their heads. 
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail, but the Arab Spring could make a line through the bill. 
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the problems in their own country. 
The Israeli defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together. 
A war with the local superpower, the new Arab governments will hardly help to rebuild their economy. 
The fact that the pragmatic President Barack Obama oust with Mursi, in order to reach a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era. 
Even the Israelis should think long-term. 
While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt one day will explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv. 
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation. 
Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll. 
Both sides need a boost from the outside world 
The right answer is those of the sensible representatives of both sides, the bulk of the outside world and will be represented by this newspaper: two states, in which Israel surrenders areas for security purposes. 
The - for the near future small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders have more influence on the implementation of this solution. 
Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar to stop the arms supplies to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by regional exchanges and a united Jerusalem, to convince. 
Outsiders Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement. 
It would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming application for un-beobachter status. 
Obama must also do its part to push Israel into negotiations. 
During his first term, he failed the idea of his own peace plan. 
Far in the White House, it seems as if he were just as opposed to a participation. 
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective. 
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. 
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
