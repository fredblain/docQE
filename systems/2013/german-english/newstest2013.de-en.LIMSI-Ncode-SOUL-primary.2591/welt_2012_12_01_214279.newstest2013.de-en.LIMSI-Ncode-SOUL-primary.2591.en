The word "human rights" is lacking in the Constitution. 
The revolution has returned to Cairo. 
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country. 
The future constitution with Sharia law as a basis is controversial. 
The Egyptian president's signature is not with emotion. 
We need to make the transition. 
"And that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and God," he said on state television. 
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but probably mainly to the Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and S채kularen. 
Because they all have been hopelessly divided into a confused opposition, are afraid. 
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by mercies of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. 
He said Mohammed Mursi almost compromise temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers, "in order to save the revolution." 
But what of the 61 year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save the Egyptians, the world is not quite aware. 
Should the judiciary be ousted? 
In fact, the 234 articles of the Islamist-dominated 100 000-strong gebends assembly in a late-night, Parforceritt 15 hours were pushed through, in part, worrying. 
As in previous constitutions, it is also in the draft law based on the "principles Islamic law." 
But what is called "principles"? 
It was and is open to interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists, the ambiguous wording and the associated legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law will be used. 
This is at least a new article suggests: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al-Ashar-Universit채t must be drawn, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great clout in the entire Sunni Islam. 
This is not, but it may mean that the clerics oversee the legislation, which de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary would entail. 
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf interpretation is 
Also problematic: the civilian military justice system is to continue to be maintained. 
These courts have been used during Mubarak's rule for the suppression of opposition brought. 
After the fall of the dictator who sat down to 11 000 civilians in military detention. 
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morality and their values." 
It is legal so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even could control the content of cinema and literature. 
In plain language, this is nothing more than censorship. 
No article, moreover, explicitly stipulates the equality of men and women. 
It prohibits the prophet Muhammad and his envoys to insult or slander. 
But what is an insult, and how it is to be punished, remains unclear. 
Equally dubious is the wording of "insulting people" should be banned. 
If there has been a caricature of the president or a joke at cost of a jurist? 
Interpretation, like so much in the draft, the Mursi for his signature before and after his words "very soon," the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum. 
"The revolution has returned." 
The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the power of the Islamists. 
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday night at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the charter even before it can enter into force. 
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third platzierter of the presidential election. 
Nobel Peace Prize winner and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft constitution was "on the scrapheap of history." 
Via intelligence service Twitter he accused Mursis supporters, a "coup against democracy" to take. 
"If he has declared the referendum, we will go to his palace and put him down," said the opposition persuade Yasser Said. 
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Khaled Ali. 
And several judges announced that the referendum failed to monitor want, which means it would be invalid. 
"The Koran is our Constitution." 
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood inflated, for their part in the counter-demonstration, precaution, but not at the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer at the other Nilufer in front of Cairo University. 
Many veiled women and supporters of Salafisten attended and said: "The people are calling for the application of God's law." 
They called Mursi: "S채ubere the country!" and beteuerten: "The Koran is our constitution." 
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would probably be the war-like situation. 
The Mursis supporters were obviously not at risk. 
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters have spoken loud and clear. 
Now it is time that the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go. 
A majority vote for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe. 
"The word 'human rights is not even before' 
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have until February and should involve all social forces. 
The 48 year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were imprisoned under Mubarak or were in court. 
It is not because he would share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible. 
For that he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned. 
"And now, the word" human rights are not even in the new constitution, "he complained in conversation with the" world on Sunday. " 
Mursi power expansion in all three branches of the state could be resigned to the lawyer. 
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship. 
"Rather than to strengthen civil society, the President de facto repealed," complained Saeda. 
But without civil society organisations could not function like a democracy. 
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement. 
This could backfire. 
One demonstrator at the Tahrir warns: "Your geb채hrt is a monster that you can no longer control."
