Israel: laboratory of chaos. 
..." That nothing comes from violence, or could ever be created," Sting sings in the song, whose main verse of the song reads: ..." so that we do not forget how fragile we are." 
"If my sons do not want, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in the year 1949 
In the wake of the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, a myriad of responses. 
There are those who stand behind Israel and argue with the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians describe as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli state, which committed genocide against the Palestinian Arabs and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist. 
At this point, I would not write about who these recurring waves of killing more guilty and who is, ultimately, the people who live in Israel, including the self-governing areas born into the current political situation, and have not seen the start of the violence. 
It is a question for me to open the readers behind the scenes, to whom the tension 95 years (expected from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small speck of land in the Middle East in particular. 
My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, while others are derived from them and from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influenced the events of modern history. 
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power. 
In every era, we can Alexander the Great or Napoleon. 
What is less obvious is the question whether it really is the people themselves were autonomous in their steps, or whether someone was behind her throne, drew their actions to a fixed target. 
We must admit that we live in an era in which the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that the concentration of money and the resultant power is not within the life span of a generation that has been created. 
Among these astronomical rich families particularly stands out, which could be described as head of the zone (I do not know whether anyone else, but I do not rule this out), the Rothschilds. 
But much will not be written about them. 
It is understandable. 
The first press agency (Reuters), the Rothschilds have already bought in the 1990s of the 19th century, in order to link their name with criminal acts, in light of the consolidation of its power, the proliferation of their assets, or both. 
The Rothschilds are almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip itself to these (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, following the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall Ghaddafis, only four, with Russia in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government has suggested). 
Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay with their lives. 
Abraham Lincoln refused the status of Rothschild Bank of America to renew as the Central Bank, began during the civil war, their own (read: government) to release notes and 1865 murdered in a theatre. 
J. F. Kennedy began to publish their own notes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; Mr. Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Federal Reserve for triggering the Great Depression in 1929 to sue. 
The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds, in the years 1859-1871 to formulate a plan to free up three world wars by Albert Pik, a Masonic of the 33rd and highest level of recognition. 
The first war was aimed at eliminating the big monarchistisch state of Europe, with the second war, in particular the British colonial rule, is to be broken, and the third war, the world population to approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their benefits and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the runup) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power. 
The method with which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (chao - order from the chaos). 
These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see creation of the Federal Reserve, so that crises like those of them in 1907 caused no repeat). 
After the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolshevik Revolution. 
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economic unfounded Germany's capitulation (for the destruction of the Russian Russian empire, the war is no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower was ungarns.

At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historic Jud√§as area with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). 
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the precondition for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first clashes with the local Arab population. 
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. 
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke from the chain, which had initially kept the international bankers, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, created the plight of European Jews in the concentration camps the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community. 
Israel was founded in 1948, and, as well as by the reparations war against Germany, is preparing the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the Third World War. 
If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, the Jewish people along the lines of the Second World War to the victims in the frontline battle, this time, along with the Arab and Muslim population in the Middle East. 
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (as people sharply divided into supporters and opponents of Israel). 
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice is wrong in an endless spiral of violence, but at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their quest for global power? 
It is between the people of Israel and its leaders, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates for election.

In what light the words David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is an across-the-board crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order." 
In its presentation, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. 
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of aristokraten. 
A world in which every newborn baby in the birth is a chip implanted, in order to subjugate the very essence of total control. 
"And it is that the small and large, the rich and the poor, the clients and the Knechts all the eichen malt in her right hand or on her cheek, that no one can buy or sell, because he was the eichen malt, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name. 
There is wisdom, who consider the number of animals. 
It is a man's figure, and his number is six hundred taking sixty six."
