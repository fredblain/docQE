Rakfisk from Norway: is that the übelriechendste fish in the world? 
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest living standards - and not only in Europe, but around the world. 
Could the success secrets of the country with the local appetite for pretty smelly fish? 
Take a selection of mature cheese varieties. 
They platziere in the midst of a bunch of dirty sports clothing. 
And they leave that there is a week. 
For example, one must imagine the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the major such delicacies of Norway. 
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo. 
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which is simply not going to disappear. 
Rakfisk is with salt bestreut trout, which - depending on how his stinking fish would like - up to a year in water will be fermented. 
If the darkness in Norway over the country, and the weather will be colder, Norwegians on a celebration here in Fagernes, this is really a very alluring specialty. 
"You eat it raw and carries it with a glass of aquavit anymore," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General" also organized the festival. 
In order to have people eat small fish cube and take large quantities of alcohol. 
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk," Havard says. 
The label can crowd out the smell. 
I cost some pausing. 
If it avoids the Rakfisk in its nose, it is not a bad thing - such as sushi, which is a very long trip. 
Rakfisk is the product of a different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no refrigeration facilities and fish in the autumn in dense salt water barrels was wet. 
In the deepest winter then he was removed after a long fermentation and, no doubt tempered by using alcohol consumed. 
Even before a generation saw thousands of Norwegians in the search for work forced to leave their country and emigrate from mainly to the United States. 
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system. 
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who not long ago was much richer than Norway, immigrants. 
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly part of Norwegian history. 
He is among the more expensive dishes that you can buy here. 
But in fact this is all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich that costs 10 euros. 
Norway is not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that. 
Here we hate it still, in contrast to Breivik naming and shaming - those racist right-wing extremist, last year 77 men, women and children shot. 
Instead, it refers only to the "incident of 22 July." 
Norwegians are struggling to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is able to such brutal killings. 
The main responsibility for the current wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien of the world. 
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waiter, who distributed some tablets with mature Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and the gut-wrenching blue eyes, embodies the Nordic ideal. 
We are, as we say, prudent people. 
Your English is just as most people here are impeccable. 
We are not very angeberisch, we may not be boasting. 
Norway is very cautious in dealing with its oil wealth - a large proportion of industry profits will be for the benefit of future generations invested in a special fund. 
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis with money that they do not have kept Norway closed its wallet. 
"As long as we ski in winter and summer, we are happy," says Anna. 
"And, of course, Rakfisk dinner," she adds with a smile. 
I am standing in the snow and put me in a different court - I have had enough of Rakfisk. 
For example, a moose burger is in any case something else, and the hefty meat. 
But the evening is once again Stinkefisch on the menu. 
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several sorts who organise a Rakfisk-Dinner in which guests for the best - or perhaps the good smell the most challenging - fish can vote. 
There is a Live-TV-Schaltung on a fly clad show master, who is surrounded by tables with Rakfisk. 
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest. 
"What have you up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor jürgen?" 
"These are our points, Havard." 
Applause and laughs. 
A man who falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit. 
But perhaps it is the strict cloud of the whole fish.
