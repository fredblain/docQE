Palliative care - the best way to die.... | Le Devoir 
With its Committee on "dying in dignity," Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of life. 
The debate must shortly be resumed, although a bill is being prepared. 
However, it remains in this important area a lot more to be done. 
Le Devoir has tried to look into this. 
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. 
The prostate cancer, which saw him aufzehrte, he had left a period of two years ago. 
"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years," he said in his bed at home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois Beloeil, in which he had reached the previous day. 
"However, it is always a shock, it is not prepared to be," he says. 
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him, just to go to the toilet and even to eat themselves. 
On the table before a delicious lunch, do he resigned a dinner to help. 
Bravely, it even manages to smile and to talk with the strangers around him, his medication, and he offers a bath. 
The courage of ordinary death. 
"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea cure, because this is humiliating," he says. 
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this scourge. 
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man in pinkelt," said Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the Victor-Gadbois home. 
In the period of childhood is to return home for some people an unacceptable humiliation. 
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept a step backwards, he says. 
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, great events take place amid these setbacks. 
The patients who are being trained Victor-Gadbois in the home for palliative care, are all suffering from cancer. 
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months. 
At this stage they are doctors and nurses who care about them, no longer with so-called "healing" care inundated. 
For Mrs A., 89 years old, is the worst fear, "deliberately and suffocation" to die. 
But by the disease, I have my children really knew. 
"I have good children," she adds. 
"I have no aspirations in life," she says, before she accepts that she is a mask, which will help it to breathe. 
It is expected in the next few days, despite a recent visit of her son, who comes from Italy. 
In the Victor-Gadbois home, with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in food intake. 
The palliative care will then be used if there are no other options. 
In order to make the deaths more pleasant. 
In Quebec, state residents a bed for palliative care. 
This is very little, given that we all will die one day. 
This is where life continued under the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home. 
Both in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. 
It granted the dying depending on a word with brandy or Pepsi. 
The diabetics have no longer control their blood sugar levels. 
And death is part of everyday life. 
Last night, we have Mr. X served up a beer, who died during the night. 
This morning, his son is the beer at the foot of the deceased austrinken. 
"We are helping families and patients alike," said nursing director Nathalie Savard. 
The Victor-Gadbois home is not a day like the other. 
As well as an old man of 93 years ago, the last family meeting in the farm and well supported by his bed, while his opening, a young man dies from 36 years ago by his parents, his wife and his two small children is surrounded, tragically, after he has tried everything, in order to survive. 
"For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years shows," says Dr Christiane Martel worries. 
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois homes come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital. 
Problem of access to palliative care 
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. a care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home. 
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and society for domestic palliative care in Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. 
It is this major shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several specialist doctors in palliative care for the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concern. 
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent figures of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard lapo man has been signed, in order to express their opposition to such an initiative. 
Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that all right to have a high-quality palliative care before agreeing to switch to euthanasia. 
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, with no action has been taken to their relief. 
I am afraid that the people want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care. 
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite stubborn worst predictions until the last day. 
The survival of Hélène Richard was already minimal, when she broke off a difficult chemotherapy. 
When I told my Onkologin that I will cut off the treatment, she replied that she was sorry that I have given up the fight, they said. 
However, she told me that I was in the end! 
No omnipotent care 
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff, that it has not granted this wish, after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care. 
However, it must be made clear that palliative care in terms of pain treatment is not omnipotent. 
Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Greater Montreal 8% of patients are not in a pain treatment. 
At the end of life, the doctors are thus often terminale Sedierung, which amounts to the patients either sporadic or lasting until einzuschläfern at the time of his death. 
We can no longer act as if we do not take one side of the suffering. 
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminale Sedierung. 
Patients whose pain cannot be alleviated, say all the same phrase: "I want to die." 
But this does not necessarily mean, "I want you to euthanise me," but "I would like to see my pain." 
The implementation of this report was possible on the basis of a Journalismusstipendiums Canadian health institutes.
