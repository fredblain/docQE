In the United States are junk food and supermarkt employees

Over the past few days, there have been everywhere in the United States for massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will increase even further, or whether they will soon return to the air. 
The protests of trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations supported. 
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers are the organizers of the protests which aim to set up trade unions. 
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized. 
46 cents per year? 
The protests began last week after thank giving the so-called Black Friday, in which Ausverk√§ufe in the United States took place, the anlockten millions of customers, which sometimes led to Handgemengen. 
On this day, some walmart workers, of whom 2.2 million worldwide, their work and bestreikten, along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targeted people of low and middle-income countries. 
Walmart sells all products, comes on hunting guns and car batteries up to saugers dust, eggs and milk. 
The commodity in the walmart branches is averaging between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. 
That is why buy many of the minor paid walmart only one of their own jobs. 
The prices and the range of goods on Walmart, one of the largest companies in the United States. 
Critics say that can often simply the goods Wal-Mart, so cheaply, because the employees are poorly paid. 
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or scanners. 
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to their own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars per month. 
A typical walmart worker, who earns 9.5 dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said. 
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley show that if the company's average wage increase to 12 dollars a hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars would cost. 
These are approximately 1,1% more than they now pay. 
If Walmart wage increases fully pass on to customers, each purchase cost them in the future only 46 cents more. 
Every year it would be for them in comparison with this additional spending of just 12.39 dollars. 
Advocates of Walmart note with satisfaction that only in nine states came to protest and that the company sucking any losses. 
The Black Friday took in his Lades of 8 o'clock at night on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart approximately 5 000 items per second. 
All in all, the walmart insurance companies in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions. 
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that as a whole "less than five" walmart workers laid down their work, and the protest campaign is just "another PR stunt" by the union, which organized the protests. 
"Free pay!" 
The protests began this week in New York, where their aim is not, however, walmart branches (which are not wanted in this progressive city, and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants. 
McDonald's says that the company sell billion chickens, and yet you have no Krankentag, and you will not be paid for your honest work!

At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation at 7,25 dollars an hour. 
In fast-food opportunities the minimum wage will be gradually increased, but not too much, and on average its ordinary staff in New York 8,90 US dollars an hour. 
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city. 
As it is possible, in New York with so little money, is beyond me. 
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's has stood behind the Theke, but the young people still lived with their parents. 
No one was seen as the main source or planned to stay there. 
Now meet me in interviews with staff members of McDonald's permanent people who complain that they live on this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children. 
On the other hand, the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal a comment, the author says that it is irresponsible to have children, if we do not know how to feed them. 
The participants in the protests on Thursday at 6.00am in the morning before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food opportunities will receive a minimum wage of 15 dollars an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. 
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry. 
The US law prohibits corporate governance to stand in the way of this objective, and abzumahnen, or to lay off union members. 
On the other hand, the corporate governance is not easy. 
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons. 
The main reason is the high turnover of staff. 
Malcontents 
Strident protests on this day, there were also many other fast-food opportunities in Manhattan. 
The climax of the protests was an assembly at midday at the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says that it sell billion chickens, and yet you do not Krankentag, and you will not pay for your honest work!" 
The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats support, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food workers together, so that they receive a fair wage and can achieve the economic prosperity that all New Yorkers deserve!." 
According to the New York Times it was the biggest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry. 
However, only a few hundred people on the ground, which is far from all are employed in the fast-food industry, in the work of tens of thousands in New York. 
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise the entire masses.
