Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life." 
The Weltenbummler of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, who was the composite sport for more than 60 years and has visited the whole world. 
Few people in Puerto Rico have a great intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes. 
Before a stroke in 2008 he was tied to the bench, Rexes was 6 years part of this sport, whether as players lower classes, players in the first National League, agent and head of BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of basketball Federation. 
"My whole life I have put many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I am president of the BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s was" remembered Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he met Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago. 
"Basketball was my life." 
Reyes is exaggerating with this statement. 
The walls of his house are almost all with photographs and memories of his long career decorated and they testify. 
Bayamón 
The emotional memories are those of his time in the Vaqueros of the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, when his 15-year-old anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or manager of the club celebrated. 
"These were my best years, which I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of the Vaqueros of eight championships since 1967 as CEO, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach. 
There have been many years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975. 
And then passed me with a schaft in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN. 
From then took over, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, " Reyes says. 
I know that I am gene Bartow, who is here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players. 
You Möchtest him? " 
This was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had. 
Bartow recommended after the free junk surgeon Raymond Gausse, who could creep and was one of our best Werfer. 
I remember how he said that if Mincy schaft had made it possible for Bayamon, Gausse for another. 
The schaft of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, because he had already stood at the top of the association. 
At that time he preferred his executions and to enjoy Mincy in the national team. 
I remember when we, for the first time in the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico won against the United States. 
Then came the World Cup in 1990, in which we showed the fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not the Canadian referee had been the last Spielzug for the second time repeated, Reyes said. 
Was this group of the World Cup in 1990, the best team you have ever seen? 
It is among the best, as well as those in the Olympic Games in 2004 against the Dream team won. 
My favorite is the team for the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won, and the team of the United States offered a struggle, as they were when they won bronze at the World Cup. 
When the team was not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who in 1990 because of a knee injury could not be in the process. 
One team, perhaps in terms of figures was not the best, with which we won a gold medal, and we were very pleased, was that of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina. 
With players such as "Canito," Pablo Alicea, and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the banned players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, contrary to every prediction won the gold medal. 
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? 
There was no doubt that Piculín Ortiz. 
His figures at the international tournaments are impressive. 
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level, such as Piculín. 
And this, without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he has played. 
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico? 
This is a difficult question. 
We have had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. 
Among the boys I liked the work of Leo Arill well. 
What do you glaubst is the best, what you have achieved in the association? 
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in a season. 
What do you still have to do? 
There are things that I could have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes. 
The fact that the boys in Ponce, for example, are only in their area and only in the national Playoffs teams from other corners of the island. 
Today, the children unnecessarily make many trips and games. 
At least I can see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches, offizielle and referees. 
This is something I am proud. 
What do you make today? 
I listen to music, see videos of music from my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I can go to a basketball game. 
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been on my side.
