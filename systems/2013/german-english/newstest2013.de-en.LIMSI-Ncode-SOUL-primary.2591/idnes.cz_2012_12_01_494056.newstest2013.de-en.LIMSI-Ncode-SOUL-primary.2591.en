The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution. 
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on voluntary work. 
This decision called on the public to have a lively debate. 
It is certainly an interesting issue from a broader perspective. 
The liberal oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. 
In effect, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other. 
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, free movement of private capital, with rampant speculation goes hand in hand. 
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions. 
Under this concept is to understand a situation in which the manufacturer is trying to import cheaper goods in economic competition by competition offers " to make a larger market share and to increase its profits. 
On a large scale this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business, and the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs. 
Since the private capital is not a social responsibility, and hence no responsibility for it causes unemployment, necessarily increase government spending. 
This situation is compounded by the fact that, the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus caused overall social economic and social damage. 
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics at this stage are superfluous. 
The reckless practice of private capital gives the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to engage in competition with each other, in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. 
In other words, the governments are providing their own population without regard to the social consequences to private capital. 
This is reflected particularly in changes in the existing legislation. 
The aim of these measures is to force its own people, the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages. 
This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, through the curtailment of workers' rights. 
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing disparities between rich and poor. 
In Germany, there have been a few years in public food distribution for poor people, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. 
The number of people affected are already in the millions. 
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly on cases where workers receive such low wages that the state their income must increase to the minimum subsistence level. 
Such a scandal was also in the case of staff members working in the German Bundestag. 
The austerity measures virtually all EU-SÃ¼dstaaten will undoubtedly amount to the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social standards are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance about whom on the margins of society, and to hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country. 
This naturally begs the question of where this capital is coming from? 
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the European wages. 
This affects the whole of Latin America. 
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state is not with capital to its own economy, and that a planned economy will lead to economic disaster. 
The private capital is insisting on his position that the state should not interfere with steering in the economy. 
Then we must ask whether the private capital policy, and thus affects the entire state in its own selfish sense or even draws. 
Here is the clear answer: yes. 
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and all lobby in all the Member States. 
The result is a desperate situation in terms of corruption, mutual preference, a legislative process, in which virtually everything, but nothing is punishable. 
In Germany, the situation is such that a government ministry of finance private companies densely intertwined with the industry charged with the drafting of legislation. 
These draft laws are subsequently adopted by the Bundestag. 
All the violence is no longer enough by the people, as Western nations, but also by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests. 
It appears that the liberal democracies are quickly caught up in a situation as they Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic to Caesar and pomp 'times' describes: "The state has long been in decay, and the posts have been filled by violence. 
Bribes, illegal fraudulent use of benefits or with stone and sword. 
The corruption rampant, and the people had already bought votes in the election ..."" people with nature is not stopped for offices, so that the state resulting from the decline eight months had no consul... " " you really began to talk about it, that the only medicine in this difficult situation an autocracy, and that there is a strong man to be elected... " Appian pomp ', but the strong man was, after all, Caesar democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship. 
What is clear is that today's society, as well as in the ancient world to the ruthless preference for their own benefit, without having to pay attention to overall social interests. 
The private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to recognize the benefit of the whole society. 
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the slightest effort to make far-reaching reforms. 
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
From the current state of view, the demise of these regimes can be seen as a pause in liberal democracies, in which the next round. 
The most disastrous is the fact that today's elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, whose witnesses we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance. 
The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution, at least not permanent. 
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to make the social level of people down. 
This trend is therefore systemic. 
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms, which will increase the shareholding of the state of the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
