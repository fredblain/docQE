Of petrodollars ella Wyatt: I was from Oxford because I Tory am 
Not only university students today are attacked for their views 
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford. 
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university, which I once regarded as the greatest mark in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - promoted. 
But within two weeks after my arrival at the Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life. 
My father broke into tears. 
My friends were confused. 
The Evening Standard said that I would have gone because I had a problem with that discover had sex in the adjoining room. 
The writer A N Wilson highlighted said that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged crockery. 
The truth, however, was less amusing. 
I walked away. 
Yes, it was because I was suffering from systematic harassment and threats. 
It is not because of my very unaccustomed name, or because I came from a private school. 
It was just me being harassed for a reason - a reason in this supposed cradle of enlightenment seemed so parochial and cruel: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher's and supporter of the Conservative Party. 
Why do I mention this now? 
Now, according to the latest reports, a new generation of students from the moderate right under similar persecution. 
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such proportions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection of gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities. 
Conservative members of the younger Common Room (JRC) of the Corpus Christi College, they will be on the basis of their political views "are often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable." 
They are calling for a seat on the equality committee of the College, in order to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed. 
Making matters worse, their situation through a recent broadcast documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis. 
It has been shown, among other graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, who was in a Rolls-Royce whose and flaunted silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock. 
At other universities say conservative students, they are seen as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees." 
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the conservative student group of the University of Nottingham, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing leftward trend in universities. 
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us ever experienced." 
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant." The 19 year old Stephanie Cherill, incoming president of the conservative student association of Oxford says that she had JCR-Mitgliedern a growing opposition to the moderate right students watched. 
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and to the wellbeing of the people," she says. 
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I was one such a minority. 
As an incredibly shy 18 year-old person I had arrived in September 1986. 
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax. 
In the last year, the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education to give an honorary title. 
The atmosphere could even shake Stalinisten. 
In the first few days of the first-year week, in which new students and Tutors learning, I received a foretaste of the future events. 
I made the experience that the Tutors mockery of Tory students is not only tolerated, but also happily attended it. 
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa, they found their way into the holzgetäfelt rooms of the Tutoriums. 
In my first these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English, in what was then, I had not been taken. 
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph." 
I stumbled on this. 
Pitt was a small man with a face like pastry, and pretty nasty. 
"If Thatcher fans learn French, or they are simply stupid?" he asked me. 
The other kicherten. 
In my eyes, wallten tears. 
"I propose that in your free time a few hours of French - that is, if you are not too preoccupied with their social activities," knurrte Pitt. 
I returned to hanging his head in my room. 
On this evening, I sat in college alone at the dinner when someone slightly tippte on the back. 
It was an English student from the second year named James, who is a member of the conservative student association. 
"I know who you are," he said. 
Unfortunately, it is what it is. 
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, will be harassed. 
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. 
Most Tory erstsemester, supporters of the Labour Party. 
In a local Pub, I later tried to stand with me. 
I insisted that I did not fully agree with Mrs Thatcher. 
This trick should prove fruitless. 
A student in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, the conservative Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist schweins." 
You are polluted. 
Other students shared his opinion. 
I was perverse and dirty. 
"How Tories have sex?" asked me one. 
The beat each other, or? 
I felt so as homosexuals in the more liberal legislation in the United States had to have felt. 
Would I ever be able to attend the Oxford University to lead a normal life? 
If I were like-minded only after onset of darkness? 
If I turn to the Labour Party, and my natural inclination to suppress? 
The three years before I began my mental eye on a fege fire of ostracism and isolation. 
The only tutor, who openly identify as Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which has had its seat in my college. 
He was not only hated to be a Conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and had written speeches for them. 
He was rarely there. 
He hated the place, found him parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his marxistisch-deterministische history. 
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent, in Ankara in Turkey. 
"You will not be happy here," he said. 
I started between Oxford and the home of my parents to move and found refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city. 
My father told me that I was Oxford hated, and why I did. 
He seemed incredulous. 
During his time in the vierzigers, all political views were accepted. 
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly. 
This is something they would never do, not in my home town of the träumend Tower. 
Even my communist friends were always impeccable manners on the day. 
His wet eyes are marred. 
Give the whole thing a chance. 
I am sure that you are only neckt you. 
I would like to break the heart if you gingst. 
Exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance was weaker. 
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and renounce his convictions. 
During a Tutoriums in the following week, when another history tutor seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same. 
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I admitted that my parents had been subjected to "brainwashing" and called them "old aiming." 
The relief lasted only a short time. 
It was my father, the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career. 
At that time he wrote a week two Kolumnen in the Murdoch press. 
My door was closed. 
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, to my persecutors. 
When they walked away, I packte a suitcase and took the first train to London. 
I never returned. 
You can look forward to a schlapp series. 
But not an 18 year-old person should ever in an educational institution suffer from such intimidation and spite. 
And even more tragic is that Oxford was a university, not just 14 Tory, but so far behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
