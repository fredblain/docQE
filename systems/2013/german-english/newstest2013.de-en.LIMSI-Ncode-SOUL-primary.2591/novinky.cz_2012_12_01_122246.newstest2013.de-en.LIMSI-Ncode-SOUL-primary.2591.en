Guidelines for the Aufblasen of balloons, for bananas and for the circus 
The server bankovnipoplatky, an annual survey on the oddest bank fees devoted, decided this year, the competition "absurd regulation or idea from the EU-Werkstatt." 
"This idea has brought us the plan recently put forward by the EU, a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organization of this poll, compared with the newspaper Právo. 
Among the nominated aberrations, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of social security charges for men and women. 
In the meantime, women enjoyed life insurance an advantage, because they are objective for the insurance companies pose a lower risk. 
"Further incredible incursions from the EU-Werkstatt can be nominated until the end of this year. 
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said. 
Among the controversial regulations include the mandatory blending of bioethanol for fuel, which is natural in its wake, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes, or the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen, because of the eggs in this year were much more expensive. 
Criticism has in the past as well as the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even the sales ban on conventional incandescent bulbs. 
Bananas must be 14 cm 
The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more member countries (the Czech Republic is currently trying to, for example, with veto threat to the demands of Czech banks). 
Lobbying interests were also behind this, that bananas of the highest class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not a "size abnormality." 
The European Commission defended with the argument that it merely inconsistent harmonisiere national standards, which would impede trade. 
The rules on fruit and vegetables were made by the EU against the resistance of some countries have already softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food. 
One candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU regulation last year, the balloons in the sale must be accompanied by pointing out that children under eight years ago the air balloon must not be allowed without supervision of an adult aufblasen. 
The EU called for an American study, according to balloons, are the leading cause of the suffocation of children. 
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten. 
Kuriose incursions are also at home 
Relatively absurd is also a directive, which the European officials themselves - anyone who plays an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece does not use the name Macedonia, and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). 
The server Bankovnípoplatky, named in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez fair, in addition to the above-mentioned aberrations, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies in the territory of a Member State. 
The EU has set the maximum volume of food supplies, which is on the day of our accession to the territory of the Czech Republic. 
The Czech Republic exceeded the prescribed amount for canned mushrooms, for which we have a large fine. 
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries money should be given to ensure that they do not have a sea, or the idea to provide funding for applications for funding. 
These ideas, however, did not come from Brussels, but also from Prague. 
"We are penalized because we have no sea. 
We will be at the EU's request for reimbursement," in autumn 2004, the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (SSD). 
The argument led to the cereal harvest was very high, and the state camps were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases. 
Since the Czech Republic has another route to ports, the EU should Palas several hundred million euros to pay us. 
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far that it is a call for tenders organised on the purchase of grain from countries which have no access to the sea. 
Funding for applications for grants from the local authorities, the Ministry of Regional Development headed by Minister Pavel Nmec (US-DEU), it should be specific about funding for the establishment of financial aid applications to Brussels. 
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception 
Regulations will be easy in the Member States to the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation, and thus also for efficiency and the development of the entire European Union deserves according to some experts, however, more recognition. 
A serious problem, according to these experts is more EU funding for projects which nothing, together with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations were imposed by individual member countries. 
Emotions at home also raises the fact that the Czech Republic like other member countries in Brussels for the right to use specific designations of traditional products must fight and this fight does not always win. 
The Czech Republic after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term 'Olomoucké tvarůžky' defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský sold short), whose tradition dating back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to "Tuzemák" redefined. 
The name rum is only allowed for products from sugar cane destillat to be used for products from sugar beet. 
In the official list of products registered in the EU in the society of the world famous cheese, feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the parm ash inkens Zwieback now also of Karlsbad, carp from Pohoelice and Tebo, or even the Saazer hops. 
With a EU-Marke Pardubicer Lebkuchen or Hoicer.
