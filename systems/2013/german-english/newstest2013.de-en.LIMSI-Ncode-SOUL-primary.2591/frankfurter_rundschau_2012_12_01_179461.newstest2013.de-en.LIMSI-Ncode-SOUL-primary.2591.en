World Aids Day: Stampfen, sing, help 
In Heidelberg, probt the Imbongi choir - and in Swaziland are AIDS orphans. 
The story of a link, which is far more than 8733 kilometers. 
First there is the Stampfes: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, Damenpumps and Herrenslipper on the parquet floor, find it quickly. 
Four. 
Only then thresholds, the voices of the singers slowly - old, Bass, tenor and Sopran - press, betören and follow. 
And Fiete Hopf, the 29 year-old Dirigents, it almost stands out from his plastic footwear, when he is bringing together with his sleek wild gestures. 
It is Monday night in the music room of the Institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg, the chorus probt Imbongi a new song. 
The 50 sänger and singer came between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics to the householder. 
"Om" Obani " is not an easy piece, every vote has a different text and still in a very foreign language: Zulu, the 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland. 
Aid to self-help 
Worldwide, there are around 34 million people, the Unaids estimates that the programme of the United Nations on the Bekämfung of AIDS. 
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. 
In Swaziland, live 245000 AIDS orphans. 
More than 40 per cent of the population are now HIV-positive. 
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the club Voices for Africa godfather found in Germany. 
More than 70 of them have a secondary school. 
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can assume a sponsor. 
It guarantees the child's school fees, school uniform and a warm meal every day in Gogo-Center. 
Imbongi is Zulu erzähler story, or even Lobpreiser. 
The bantu tongue fluid can no one in this room, but sing. 
For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this alien soft language and brings them back to where they originally come from: in southern Africa. 
8 733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir. 
Forty percent are infected 
Some 2 000 people live there, some still in simple Lehm and Strohhütten, a large part of them are children. 
More than 300 of them have no parents because they have succumbed to HIV. 
In Esitjeni shows in small, Swaziland suffers: the highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy in the world, according UNICEF. 
Cuts back to the male Vorhaut, the risk of contagion has been shown to reduce the half, are hardly accepted by the population. 
More than 40% of people in Swaziland have the immunschwäche virus to die in 30 is not uncommon. 
In the case of a joint African tour in the spring of 2005 was the chorus the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply to everyone: food, clothing, education. 
Without education, people in a poor country still have no chance. 
Initially, it was the personal involvement of individuals, for a few euros per year to send a child to school and give him a warm meal on the day. 
But a year later founded the chorus of the club "Voices for Africa," which has since been almost professionally cares about the AIDS waises in Esitjeni.

By inconsistency, donations and not least the advantageous chorus in Germany, ersingt, is a great deal together. 
"Overall, we have already had some EUR 200 000 sent to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the club. 
In the village itself managed Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman from Germany. 
They are also concerned that the orphans are well, with one of the grandmothers, for example. 
The Gogos, known as the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village. 
Some of them have up to 14 orphans to give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day on time for school. 
Anyone who has no one comes to the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who is being paid by the club as well as the two Köchins every day for more than 200 hungry children. 
In addition, "Voices for Africa" launched a Nähschule, two chicken houses built and together with the American health organization PSI organized that many people in the village have a HIV-Test. 
This is not a foregone conclusion, because it appears the disease throughout the country, it is silent they prefer dead. 
A king with 14 wives 
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality." 
In fact, strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives. 
The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, who is known for his excessive lifestyle. 
Polygamy rather than democracy. 
Among other things, it is also the state contained lifestyle that HIV has spread so rapidly in recent decades. 
But many migrant workers, who carry the virus through the country. 
Free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz," but they are hardly used. 
Culture is another - flesh to flesh." 
In order for the cultural exchanges to promote something, the Imbongi-Chor travels every two or three years together through the South Africa and singing songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many in the south of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid. 
A bus full of white people singing the songs in a black language - so much recognition does not only mood and joy, but it has also been some grim border guards a few tears civil. 
The journey will always lead to Esitjeni, where the singers are visiting their godchildren. 
Even though the small village on maps is hardly in the valley of Ezulweni-Flusses, it is more than known. 
"If, after Esitjeni, there is the light," say the people who live there. 
And if the 8733 kilometre airline returns to Heidelberg, the stampfend Sängers in the test area on the Bergheimer road, then you can see it.
