Key issues 
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English graduate in education and learning, says that in order to guide the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is to inform. 
"The Internet was created as a vehicle for the search for information; with the appearance of these parties have changed the rules," she says. 
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a Master-Titels in teaching at the Yale and author of the book "Digital extra virgin and Immigrants" shaped these concepts to explain the phenomenon. 
The digitals extra virgin they are children and young people who have grown up with this technology. 
"We are digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we still have to learn," he says. 
He says that it is a complex issue, "because we demand of them that they have a defined criterion about what can be published or said, and this in an age where the maturity is not enough." 
"They should also be wählerisch if they are the most important thing to be loved, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.

"To tell you that they should not do not work," he says. 
Porras followed a number of possibilities: there are things that you find not tell a stranger, why the Internet? 
Or, if you like, if you have a photograph published by you, as you have published by a friend? 
Do you know what the rest of you publish? 
The other people had asked for permission if you pictures of celebrations were labelled? 
And one more question: do we all know what you are at any moment? 
Another point is for them to understand that they must act as they do offline. 
These are the same rules. 
"Someone is acting outside of the Internet with respect, decency and other principles, and do this same must apply to the social networks," he says.
