Eigener taste rather than culture - rosbalt; ru 
Rosbalt, the project "Petersburg avant-garde," the city dwellers, who are the vanguard of the arts and culture. 
On the elite list have already landed senior representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city, and often acceptance in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be known. 
The new hero of Rosbalt is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. 
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, dressed in red at the Russian Museum, in the summer, at szene or at Vernissages. 
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they attract large numbers of people. 
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg philosophical artists, who are creating new myths. 
Kirill Miller is a shining figure in the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. 
He is also a man of the city and set by his presence on the road to his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides them with good humour. 
He recently grabbed a Drehorgel and was Drehorgelspieler at the Petersburg, as he has for this difficult role in terms of his art, his philosophy and his image was finally ready. 
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example in amber or Türkis in the city en route? 
I have the color red, as fashion designers, which deals with the optics and the image. 
In this world red is the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society. 
In the society, everything differs from the norm, aggression and bad behaviour. 
I want my provocations with the people who come into contact. 
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to the conversation. 
- When will you wusstest, you must be painters? 
- In an exhibition at the Newskij Cultural Palace, in which my work was issued. 
I realised that I must go down this road. 
Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painters at the time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible. 
I befreundete myself with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was a "Puschkinskaja 10," and then was first brought to an end. 
I am the theatre, fashion, music, at all, apart from the literature. 
- And all this in your Art-Klinik... - it was important, at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should meet. 
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was up to the renovation a musikalisch künstlerischen club for the Boheme, the home of the Petersburg Boheme. 
Many were born there: N. O. M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember, too, such as string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" was there. 
String and his friends sang simple songs on the play back, wearing tight T-shirts and was also the composer Igor Wdowin today. 
When the group began to play live, it was out of its "Leningrad." 
Trachten facilitated many programmes before the era of "Halli-Galli." 
We gave them trachten, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us. 
Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the Art-Klinik. 
To have our staff and passengers. 
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something. 
In the year 2000, there have been in the press a survey, when it comes to the award "personalities of our city." 
I won in the category of "artists of the year," and so I have reached the peak. 
It is not easy to work in a new era under the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. 
At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution. 
Your work has a distinctive style. 
- Many of my pictures are real gems and make clear the timeliness and thoroughness of the ideas expressed. 
I will be an exhibition on the theme of "the Russian Museum as clowns." 
Clowns are timeless. 
In the past I was social, but now it is painful and is afraid to be so. 
In a clown blurred and loses his tragedy. 
I love the absurdity, and I have bizarre ideas. 
Let us save the world by telling people that everyone has to dress up completely. 
Now everyone on the clothes and modelled on the exterior, and not on the inside of the human being. 
But perhaps we should not give a man, but he should face spucken. 
The deception is disappearing through the Verkleiden. 
Recently we saw you in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers - as a cultural city should have a hero. 
Who, if I do not? 
- Commercial art can be nice? 
Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, thoughtful and flattering. 
We are seeing the disintegration of cultures. 
In the past people were large groups: the Bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people the other. 
Now there are micro communities, and it is hard to please everyone. 
I am not a hundred dollar notes, which everyone likes it. 
Now you have to think about whom you will like. 
Now, each country star around 100 followers. 
- With regard to the presence of Stas Michailow but several thousand! 
He abandoned women, where the sexuell Social sphere plays a role. 
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is based. 
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved. 
In my youth, I have painted these pictures from a collector, even in a number of the works of Falk and Larionow. 
I started with images which normally come at the end of the career. 
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings. 
It says: ' Intellectual culture and consumer culture. 
Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something quite different. 
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and money. 
This is the culture, which I support. 
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg? 
- Good. 
It says: "Servant of the culture. 
But not every one of them can deal with culture. 
In the real tsars, it was different, because the tsars may not understand a lot of culture, but they understood that proper experts are needed. 
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. 
In St. Petersburg, we have what could be the experts, but they will be barred, because there is a need for hochrangigerer experts to assess the former right and pave the way forward. 
Now it is only their own taste. 
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must find other museums. 
- What is for St. Petersburg? 
- St. Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture, in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground. 
Our art is difficult to grow. 
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we have become more writers than readers, and this is not true. 
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts. 
We are much less. 
Art must again be modern, as at the beginning of the last century. 
The project will help the city St Petersburg
