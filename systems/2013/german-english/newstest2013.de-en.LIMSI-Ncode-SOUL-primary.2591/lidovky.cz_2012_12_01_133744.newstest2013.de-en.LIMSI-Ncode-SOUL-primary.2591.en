The film Argo: if it is the worst, Hollywood appeal 
In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. 
For their release they called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi have had fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the Patronat of his regime. 
For the American government, there has been no positive way out of this situation, it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as the confidence of its allies have been severely damaged in other countries. 
At the same time it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages. 
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of the hostage exemption made everything worse. 
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government. 
The fate of the hostages at home called a wave of solidarity, as well as Iranian sentiments. 
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980. 
The Argo film by the director and Schauspielers Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which the United States led a small partial victory. 
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff on the flight. 
This ended after numerous delays in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. 
According to the CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, and helped them an extravagant story on the Verdeckung of their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, the alleged plot locations visited for a science-fiction movie. 
The combination of Genres 
The expert on "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan also made Hollywood's cooperation necessary. 
This means that the camouflage was credible, published articles on this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office. 
The details of this operation were long kept secret, but the film is based on the memory of Tony Mendez. 
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres. 
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie," i.e. the story of a successful Husarenst√ºcks such as the film Ocean Eleven. 
This change in the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the own scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence are iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences). 
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, ironic and slightly excessive. 
And then there are the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions - men in suits at the table, at the flurs office, on the phone.... 
Ben Affleck is a remarkable start with this film of his career success. 
A derided actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic comments. 
Argo is his third movie after the thrillers no pushover (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). 
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in Boston by the director. 
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the previous films by this director of standard Hollywood -- contrasted with. 
Affleck is proof of this sensitivity, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played." 
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events which have actually taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its simplicity, and gives the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictable nature, which, if the story. 
A similar effect Affleck with his team, even in fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran). 
Too much action in many places 
The director also had to deal with that history does not really many exciting moments in the cinema. 
With the little he has been working quite successfully, and he sometimes helps the reality - which has not always been so elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran will be averted by a telephone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, are a bit curious). 
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is caused by the need to spend a lot of action in many places to show. 
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood officials are very charming, but their characters deserve more space, and so that they are in the film far from alone. 
Afflecks film that it loses a little traction, and it is a film with some interest and the design and the Retro-Stil, reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years goutieren. 
Enthusiasm, however, makes it difficult. 
As a reminder of a day in some way living piece of history, and as evidence of how excessive the notions of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, but it is enough.
