On Friday, the prosecutor has tried to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - indicted for the biggest disclosure of confidential information in the US history, missed several opportunities to complain about allegedly suffered mistreatment in military detention. 
In a cross-examination Mannings during a vorgerichtlichen hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein, that documents on weekly visits to the prison officers during Mannings nine-month prison in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment. 
A day before the cross-examination, the result of a request by the defence for the dismissal of the indictment was held - by the harsh prison time Manning had already been punished enough, Manning had testified that he would have been considered in prison suicides. 
According to the US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of during his time in Iraq thousands of confidential documents were stolen. 
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet. 
WikiLeaks Manning as a source of information has never been confirmed. 
In the hearing on Friday with Manning went through the forms, the officials after their meetings with Manning had been filled out during his detention in Quantico-Militärgefängnis, where he from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced conditions had been satisfied. 
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers to. 
When Fein on Friday quizzed him on the forms, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional." 
The forms contained no complaints about abuse, even though the Manning officials had directly asked about his treatment. 
Manning said that he had verbally expressed his concerns and that the officials had discussed with him and to deal with them, but they have not been recorded. 
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns)," no problems ," and not necessarily meant that I said nothing at all," Manning said. 
The judge, Col. Denise Lindh, Manning also asked why he did not besch about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011, a few months earlier on a form mentioned suicide should investigate. 
Manning said his intention during this meeting have been his status for the "prevention of injury" downgrading. 
The military said that it was him that restrictive status - a level below the suicide risk, and the protection of others. 
"I wanted to convince people that it was a good thing, and get rid of the observer status for the prevention of violations (...) to achieve a higher quality from my perspective, to achieve," said Manning. 
Manning said Thursday on his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he nearly two months was detained before he in July 2010 in the prison of the Quantico naval base in Virginia. 
He said that in Kuwait he had considered the suicide and had become unconscious due to the heat again. 
Not knowing what with him or in the outside world, was costly. 
"My world fell on Camp Arafjon, in the same cage," Manning said on Thursday. 
I thought I would die in this cage. 
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning had the bulk of his time spent in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society. 
It gave him only a mattress, a blanket, Flip-Flops, clothes and his glasses. 
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or only. 
He was always forced to sleep with the light from the outside in his cell. 
If he had turned back at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was buoyant, so that he is back. 
In January 2011, Mannings lawyers formally objected to the Mannings. 
In April 2011, Manning in the military prison of Fort leave worth Kansas. 
On Friday, the judge quizzed Manning also on a charge that he had made in his statement on Thursday - he had a night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico and naked in a morning count before guards and other prisoners. 
Manning had testified that he had during this count never had the opportunity to umhüllen with his blanket. 
At the hearing on Friday, Manning, he had ordered his guards closed the ceiling, with which he could have, but he admitted that he had not called upon to do so. 
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to do so in the previous night to sleep naked; he had previously tried to show an official that he is not a threat to himself. 
Manning said the official, he would have the backing of his underwear or his Flip-Flops can use to injure himself, but this is not done. 
On this night, Manning said, his underwear, Flip-Flops and glasses have been removed from his cell. 
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention and will drastically reduce his prison sentence, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year. 
The defense has indicated that Manning committed minor offences guilty, while other charges, which are regarded as too extreme to be challenged. 
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the prosecutor is expected to have a justification of the detention conditions. 
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the rules, which apply to all prisoners incarcerated under the highest safety precautions in Quantico. 
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegal publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents. 
If he in all charges was found guilty, he faces a life sentence.
