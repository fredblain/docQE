"People want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," Okamura said. 
Mr. Senator, how is the idea to stand for the office of the president? 
It is not for me to be a senator or president. 
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would get nowhere to stand. 
But I can no longer see how the republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves walk free, while the taxes and the retirement age will be increased. 
I had no ambition to become a politician. 
But when I see something which I do not like, then I am trying to propose a solution to change this. 
And since I am already more than 40, and independent and French departments, I have no other way to influence the situation than for the senator or the president to stand for election. 
In the Senate, you have succeeded, and then on the road to the castle. 
You will not let your constituents back? 
I have told the whole time that the battle for the Castle will begin after the outcome of the senatorial election. 
Later, I have clarified this and said that I will be standing for the office of the President, if I am elected to the senator. 
My goal is not the function and the function is an instrument with which I can achieve my vision. 
For that I do not need as much influence and a strong mandate. 
The problem is not only that we as a people in the pub and on the television, but anyone who wants to make a difference. 
Then there are the media who want to deprive the privilege and freedom of speech with the freedom to confuse them. 
For me, for example, it has been claimed that I would be bribed or that I was by Jiří Paroubek. 
Are we talking about your dreams. 
The fight for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retroactive assets of over 20 million kronor. 
To this end, you must change laws. 
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals. 
How are you going to solve this problem? 
As an ordinary citizen, I have argued that the travel officer remains a free trade, and this could be enforced. 
The problem is the petty politics - if someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and it is only on the population. 
As an independent party, I have a far greater potential support from all the parties represented in Parliament to win. 
My advantage is that I am without schublade thinking and party dogma from any party that can take what is the best for our country. 
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather than the right or the left? 
From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people would rather see the left. 
I find this left-right thinking but completely irrelevant. 
For me, it is important that we move forward. 
It is not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right wing; I would like to bind the people. 
I am always in public every good solution, even if this KSM or of the ODS, and I am opposed to bad ideas as well. 
I hate you if someone described you as populists. 
But you do not confirm this by what you just said? 
If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have a goal and a vision. 
And do you want to get closer to this. 
One may describe it as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken to function in the world, or they have been discussed by key experts. 
But without support in Parliament you are only buzzwords. 
And if you are in politics not long term. 
Or do you think that you, if you talk long enough with the people, we will be able to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability? 
I have no other option. 
Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them on our side, in order to achieve these goals. 
As president, it would not be a problem for me, the leader of the parliamentary parties live on television to call the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to lay down the law. 
And then, if necessary, the Angesprochenen would have to say why they do not. 
A strong personality, which draws attention to grievances, can exert pressure on the political scene. 
Look at the direct election of the president, who was a result of public pressure. 
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. 
I am trying to find allies for my views and vision. 
In politics, I have only just begun and I am trying for my programme to find the support of the majority. 
I always try to assess the situation itself; and if it does not work, then I would go in six years in the private sector. 
This sounds a bit as if Okamura save the Czech Republic. 
I am not a savior. 
I know that I am not alone; that is why I have discussed this with several well-known personalities, whether they do not want to run for the Senate. 
I spoke with Radim Janura, for example, but refused because of overwork. 
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jan?a Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil. 
My candidacy, I began with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure. 
Sixty per cent of voters have not gone to the polls, and those who have chosen most representative of the establishment. 
In the Senate, we are just two independents. 
People have chosen such a composition that changes will be very difficult to implement. 
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and county chief leaders. 
Do you think about the establishment of a separate party? 
I have not yet thought, because I have no time to check every potential party member, and do not have the money to do so. 
I have no money for the presidential campaign; my transparent accounts are no more than 20 000 CZK. 
You have no money? 
You are talking about asset declarations, how would you? 
My property value at approximately CZK 60 million. 
In Prague, I have a piece of land with a value of 25 million, an apartment for around 10 million, a further 8 million, an art collection, which is about 10 million worth, as well as an Ashton Martin for 3.5 million, and a kodu Superb, around a million is worth, and then I have a couple of million in the bank account. 
The Ashton Martin was, in fact, a childhood dream - James Bond liked me always, as he was driving in the car, was galant for women, and at the same time fighting against evil. 
You are a Ashton Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? 
You say that you want to change the republic, but your own money you do not want to invest. 
This is not very convincing. 
I did not have 15 million for the campaign. 
What I am going to make debt? 
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign. 
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my programme may not be too much interest. 
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources. 
The costs of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator. 
But the senator content I could not live alone, such as my son, I could not finance the English school, the 30 000 per month costs. 
If I just wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing. 
If you continue to act as a businessman, in order to have your livelihood? 
Are you saying that you are going to cut back these activities? 
But this is not related to the size of the salary. 
As promised, I have my activities partially scaled down. 
For example, for example, my deputy director in the spring of the travel office. 
People want to see me as a Samaritans, who saved the republic. 
But I must also live on something. 
At which monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur? 
Approximately 200 000 to 400 000, and this is still the case. 
As President, I would stop my actions.
