With Bitcoin payments and selling without a bank is possible 
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identify transactions and administrative fees between the parties involved. 
Moreover, as so often in these technologies a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies will lead to financial crises. 
In fact, Satoshi naka moto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc. convertible) and a protocol on the safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files. 
With 15 000 computers in the network have already collected around 200 000 transactions. 
Several thousand Web sites accept Bitcoin as a donation or a payment. 
After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later he fell to 2 dollars before he now has recovered to around 10 dollars (prices are on the website bitcoincharts). 
Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the global trade of real currencies or financial products. 
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currency interest shown for this purpose. 
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies." 
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the " ," which will be used to make progress in a video game by winning games or buy (and sometimes exchange). 
The social network of Facebook has also developed such a system. 
However, the trade is constantly monitored and dealt with by a central authority. 
Bitcoin are all network hubs at the same time repositories of the accounting book, auditors, financial issuers, as well as buyers and sellers. 
How this network works? 
Any transaction between two users is in fact between two Email addresses through an Email. 
With the difference that the user can choose to pay a different address, which ensures the anonymity. 
A number of information related to this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system. 
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. 
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the widespread accounting book in the entire network of public accounts are available. 
The decisive step is to sign this new transaction in this book. 
This is done through a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line. 
It is a carving up the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint. 
The computers "are" the new transaction, and they add a figure before the whole thing will be "dismantled." 
The aim is to find the figure, which is a special fingerprint (many noughts at the beginning). 
If this figure has been found, the other knot can easily check whether it is the right one. 
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint. 
If a user on the Betr√ºgen two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for, would only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains without any link, because they have different fingerprints. 
The computer, which has solved the task, receives 50 Bitcoins. 
In order to prevent an inflation rate that reward will be regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012. 
The circulating Bitcoins is thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionstel divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre.... 
Moreover, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in computing power. 
The life of the network has already peaks and troughs. 
The Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen from the Bitcoin-Einlagen. 
"The weakness is not the real record," said Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, a company to pay with real money, and Bitcoin is using the network. 
The European Central Bank also reported on the possibility of money laundering by means of this anonymous service. 
However, it also has cash on these shortcomings. 
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind. 
Others, such as the Twitter-style Word press will accept them. 
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation. 
In November, a "Mega-Schlussverkauf" started. 
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company coin abul, the Bitcoins converted into gold. 
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. 
His Paytunia system is in line with a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin for the validation of transactions, which are cheaper. 
In addition, the holder managed its identity and can therefore remain anonymous. 
The system can be easily implemented in the shops, and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs. 
You must simply indicate an address from a telephone "photographed and identified," Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users. 
It is a general trend in which the hierarchical systems for more horizontal required systems are being reviewed. 
"It will take some time before Bitcoin wins, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted. 
The ECB is, in fact, in its report, the various today as a highly regarded risks in the event of a success to revalue its currency.
