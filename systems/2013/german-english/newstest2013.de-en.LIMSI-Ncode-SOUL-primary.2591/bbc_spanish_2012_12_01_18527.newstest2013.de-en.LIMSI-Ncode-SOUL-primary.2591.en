Singapore needs babies to save the economy 
The Singapurer lay the blame for that they have no children, careers, the stress and the cost of housing and child-rearing. 
"The people of Singapore need to grow." 
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we perform our civic duty and we create life! 
It seems incredible that the lyrics are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore for a viralen video on YouTube. 
The sentences are part of a Rapper-Songs, local slogans such as "pushing a" bao " (loaf) in the oven, about the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun. 
The advertising agency BBH, which revolved around the video, preserves the hope that the advert funny way to draw attention to the problem. 
Your creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their "national duty." 
This is something just for the Internet, which is why we have had to make it fun and funny. 
It is the biggest problem in this country. 
We are the worst performer in the world, so we felt that it is an issue for which we have had to deal with. 
We knew that the government had tried to do many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of Speed-Dating-Abenden (fast Flirts). 
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily succeed. 
That is why we thought: why do we not do something as creative as possible, in order to tackle this problem, such as a rap on komponieren? 
1.2 million children 
If this issue is not easy, it is the government of Singapore. 
Every year there are 1 300 US dollars for political action in order to encourage citizens to have more children. 
A package of government grants for couples and parents up to 15 000 Dollar per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits. 
But everything has had little success. 
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in south-east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is well known. 
According to its national authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. 
The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as the ersetzung rate - was in 1976. 
So why are Singapurer not more children? 
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of national authority, says that this "better education" and "greater career opportunities." 
"This has enabled the people to marry and to form a family much more options in terms of life objectives and to set priorities," she said. 
These changes in the social conditions for the higher number of people living alone, and the delay of marriage and births, the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore. 
Meanwhile, an immigration policy, which aims at a drastic increase in the number of uphold, in order to counter the reduction of the population, with resentment among the local population. 
In Singapore, there are Web sites where little covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for keeping wages low and do not integrate. 
The rise in immigration is also one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence. 
Since the elections, an attempt has been made, the problem with higher fees and charges for foreign workers. 
Unexpected consequences 
While the falling birth rate is the well-known impact on economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policy, the Singapore example shows unexpected consequences. 
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are built. 
For example, it already has an impact on the housing market. 
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small Appartements, which are known as "schachteln" and in certain parts of the city should be built. 
These Appartements have a residential area of 46 square metres and show a great success. 
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of single people, and that they are deterred by the construction companies to build large homes for families. 
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company El Developers, says that its "schachteln footwear" much faster than larger residential units sell. 
They are so popular, and the units are just days and even weeks out faster than the larger housing units. 
This means that our Cash Flow are much better. 
However, he admits that the new rules give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way, if they too many small residential units within a project to build. 
Too much stress 
Singapore is a city state. 
Even if these new rules pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singapurern, who work in the financial community to see that they will not have a major impact. 
"The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why it is being delayed by many," says a young manager. 
The children can get others. 
"For me, it is important to have my own money and time," says another, roughly 20 years old man. 
Men and women have their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and education as a reason that they have no children. 
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to having children, because the government can still do so much.
