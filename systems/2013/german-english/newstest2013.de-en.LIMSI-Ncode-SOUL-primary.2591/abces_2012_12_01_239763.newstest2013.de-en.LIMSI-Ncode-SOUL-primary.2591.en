The most difficult profession in the world: the human Kawah Ijen 
For four euros the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk when they are 70 kilograms of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths. 
There are people for whom their work is the hell, and others are working literally in hell. 
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 workers who earn their lives by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. 
To this end, he is every day down to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas from the earth ausströmend in contact with the air. 
Having a large stone extracted as a whole can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bambus körben on his shoulders on the slope of stone. 
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is down to a level of 2386 metres, but the depleted agencies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in schildkröte rates, and they retain the balance and must put their steps carefully, so that they do not slip and fall. 
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist, a few years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen crashed. 
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur, which they cut down. 
It is the path between the tourists, who photographed as circus apes and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company a little bit further down on a total of 1 850 metres 
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, since 1960, the presence of the volcano and (rather) exploiting its workers, 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. 
They then sold for 10 000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because of this mineral in their everyday lives is widespread and the manufacture of matches, fireworks toys, cosmetics, destroy - yes, even the Bleiche of sugar is used. 
"As we normally 70 kilograms, we get to any way around 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros)," said Anto, who usually makes three routes on the same day. 
For each route he needed three hours, according to which he is completely at the end of the day, but then 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros). 
What a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but is three times as much of what he would earn with the toil. 
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be paid on the same day, and the average monthly income two million rupees (167 million euros), is very high," explained the winner, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali. 
He earned 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family, according to Banyuwangi, a village in the vicinity, returned, and for a reason, which in Indonesia is as important as the sulphur: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are, and I have brought them to Java, converting to Islam." 
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often hustet, and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases. 
The 27-year-old Anto, for three years his life on the Kawah Ijen at risk, the sulphur in the first traces, even though he covers his face with a mask and Spezialbrille. 
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often hustet, and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano. 
This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream. 
"I will work here two years, because I open a shop or wants to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English. 
This pleasant and intelligent, but the gestrafte young man could be a tourist guides, waiters or working on the reception of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a Tragesels. 
He shares a dirty wooden lodge with other agencies, and every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also emit at night, where his distinctive yellow color bläulich shines in the darkness. 
The shadow challenging, it is rising in the light of a small few lamp on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money into the crater. 
Around 400 bodies on the krater bed baskets with sulphur on their shoulders. 
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction, in order to save costs, and provides the agencies, which are working on their own account and are paid according to weight, no equipment. 
You will not receive a share of the 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of the natural park, along with the entrance fee in excess of 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) demanded by the tourists, the photography of the volcano and the human Tragesel. 
"This work is for the animals and not for the people," protested Madrusin, a 42 years old, the three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen. 
He is in a position to 110 kilograms and assured that he continued, "as long as it is," because he has the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years. 
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life. 
Even if the sulphur throats burn and eyes jucken when the wind suddenly and einklemmt the mine workers in the thick pillars, rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases..., of course, apart from the usual breathing problems, today's pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which have distorted by the weight of the baskets. 
The basket on his back is Unainik with his 53 years only in a position to carry 50 kilograms. 
Every day he and his associates 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, from three trucks on a road between the Gebüsch camp in taman sari in 18 kilometres away. 
"I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik said, and he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing. 
From his five children is the grandfather with his 30 years as a source. 
The time passes, but poverty is generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: those who as a human cash cow at the Kawah Ijen.
