Interior ministry denies illegal arms market 
Percentage of legal weapons to crime extremely low 
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of the arms bill for private gun owners. 
This means that the authorities are reacting to the recent events: people have been wounded in shootings at weddings and seven deaths during the killing spree of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow. 
The police want the wearing of lethal weapons in the public and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years. 
According to the proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee for security and corruption, Irina Jarowaja, support and promised that the changes in the arms bill will soon be submitted to the Duma. 
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities, the problems with "hold the screws" want to fight. 
The Internet has been published an open letter, whose author - representatives of various armed groups - are demanding from the authorities of "senseless." 
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC. 
According to the statistics of the Interior Ministry, there were 142 crimes with use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total 1 168 thousands of offences were recorded. 
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals to operate on the black market. 
At the moment, you can, according to the authors in Moscow every possible weapon for little money. 
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control. 
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers 
The weapons arrived on several channels on the black market. 
There are five main channels, told a former Col. Viktor Baranez, the ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.

The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus. 
"The weapons were both of the Russian officers and the Kaukasiers itself stolen," Baranez says. 
On the second channel illegal weapons, police defenders are stolen by criminals. 
Baranez explained that this weapons count, both from the armouries of the police force and directly by members of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen. 
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals. 
In many military camps, there have been frequent explosions. 
"There is evidence that in some cases of arson was to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel. 
A contribution to the black market, according to Baranez, the arms manufacturers. 
"Today there are countless private arms factories, which do not stand up to the international competition and therefore the weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow," said the expert. 
Another channel of the black market is smuggling. 
Many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan. 
"There is a separate, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a Mafia, organized smuggling," explained the former military personnel. 
Where are the weapons? 
Experts calculated what percentage of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons. 
In 2011, a report was drawn up by the Centre for analysis and public administration. 
The experts analyzed reports from the Interior Ministry and the federal service for state statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the issue of weapons. 
The vast majority of illegal weapons came from, according to the investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities. 
Half of all weapons on the black market were to go through the "guilt of those responsible in their work to do with weapons," it says in the report. 
According to the data of the researchers, 17% of weapons from conflict zones, 14% of thefts in the arms production, and 5% comes from illegal excavation. 
A sales adviser of an arms shop were to do, who does not want to be named, assured that weapons, which are found in illegal digs, for a long time no one is buying, because they are outdated. 
He said that it is more likely that traders in a military camp. 
More than a FÃ¤hnrich is a weapon, for example a pistol from the TT type bought. 
The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence. 
"The dealer brings the weapon in the city and sold them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he said 
"The police, of course, know all about them, and that is why, if the plan for the detection of crime cannot comply with periodic monitoring purchases by traders by offering illegal weapons," the advisor adds. 
"As in luxury shops" 
Buyers and sellers find most acquaintances with each other. 
I was looking at websites and blogs, as someone who has been paying attention to me, and I suggested to the station "Begowaja," where a person would wait for me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price. 
The price of the weapon I was told 
Military commentator Viktor Baranez 
"In order to obtain a weapon, I need a friend, contacts," the adviser said. "I have a friend, but I do not trust him." 
There are traders on the markets, but we must go there and have agreed on a code such as "Ivan Iwanowitsch, which is that the daughter has lost a tooth." 
I am now even in some newspaper syndicates about an acquaintance, whom I trust. 
He gives me the networks simply because he knows that I do not verpfeife him. 
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways. 
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried in the 1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject. 
The models according to him have not changed. 
He was given a photo album, where "everything possible" was contemplated. 
"I felt like a luxury shop," remembers the military personnel. 
The buyer gets Baranez is not a pig in a poke, but can try everything. 
I buy as a potential customer is not only easy, but it will go with the seller in the forest, and that is where we are a target. 
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," the expert describes the approach. 
Shopping on the sofa 
Internet search engines show search results on Web sites and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons "for various purposes" are being offered. 
It will not require any documents or there are personal meetings. 
"You need just the right amount money," it says in the advertisement on the website "pistol or rifle purchase." 
That is where users give your orders and ask questions. 
It is also being sold to minors? 
"Of course, without a license," asks users, "Ivan" (direct quote). 
"Kaufe a TT: Moscow" is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow." 
The Federal Security Service attacked recently a number of bogus websites, and buyers want to buy the weapons, the service on the Web.

I have heard about the following scheme: the website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply. 
The authorities are taking the orders. 
The buyer has the money via a bank machine. 
"As a response he receives a photograph and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," told the press officer of the non-profit organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow. 
Viktor Baranez stressed that it would also be left empty-handed at the end and may be behind bars, if you have a question placed on a website.
