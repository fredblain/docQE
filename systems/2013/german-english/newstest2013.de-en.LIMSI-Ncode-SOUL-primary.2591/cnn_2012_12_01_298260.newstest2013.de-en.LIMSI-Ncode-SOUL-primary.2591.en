I am between Mexico and amerikanische identity crisis. 
Many people are due to the lack of opportunities being forced to leave Mexico 
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times to remember, he says 
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans between two worlds are caught 
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just traversed the Hall and had arrived at the passport control, as confusion was widespread in me. 
Placards referred to two lines: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners"). 
I was there a few seconds long, uncertain about which I should come. 
I grew up in central California, and was my entire life called "Mexicans." 
An ethnic acronym - as well as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York call "Italians." 
Later, I decided to "between Mexico and America." 
But Mexico was here. 
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for KÃ¼rzels or slashed. 
I was just Americans. 
I am speaking Spanish, or at least good enough to me in this language at both ends of an interview. 
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I am not going on. 
So I took up my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros. 
I thought about the moment after this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama. 
On the agenda of all those issues, which we expected when the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade. 
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, but it is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States. 
He wants to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and a North American trade bloc, according to a model of the European Union. 
And Pena Nieto vowed that Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even though he gave no details in this regard. 
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment. 
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848, and the leadership of the country under a gun forced more than half of its territory. 
But for Mexicans, who in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event cannot be overlooked. 
As soon as a US official only mildest criticism in Mexico, we are told, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - will be besch about how the Americans press the sovereignty of their neighbour. 
And monte zumas are moving on the path of war. 
Yet it is the biggest challenge facing Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. 
Inclination to talk about resentment? 
There are more than enough. 
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country opens, and others, for whom it does not do this. 
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point in our tree a person - perhaps a parent or parent - no chance in Mexico and got in on the road north. 
And in most cases, this person had a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, and so on. 
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is important to them. 
It is not Mexico. 
Although we may now live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican. 
Our identity is sometimes perhaps blurred, but what our loyalty, this is not the case. 
This clearly applies to the United States. 
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class may not be. 
This is based on reciprocity. 
You can see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look to us because we are not Mexican enough. 
Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties with Mexico have never been strong enough. 
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of the failure. 
If not our families in Mexico have failed, they would not have gone. 
And then we are not behind the silk curtains - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. 
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally in the United States, einwanderte reminded me that tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans are taking this seriously. 
While US citizen, sees it as part of two countries. 
But many Mexican Americans, who I know, have the feeling that neither to be part of the other country. 
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. 
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but it is rooted in any one of them. 
In Mexico, we are going to be seen as an American. 
And in the United States, we are going to be seen as Mexicans. 
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the chattering classes would resume their ties to the diaspora. 
They want to see Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States. 
We are supposed to tell our American colleague about how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leadership to step up its ties with Mexico. 
Now. 
This will not happen. 
Too many injured. 
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country. 
I am afraid, as you alone, cronies. 
This is fair. 
If at least some Mexicans are still not ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico in a century and a half, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grievance for how their family members have been treated not so long ago. 
Hmmm. 
Maybe we are "of Mexican" than I thought.
