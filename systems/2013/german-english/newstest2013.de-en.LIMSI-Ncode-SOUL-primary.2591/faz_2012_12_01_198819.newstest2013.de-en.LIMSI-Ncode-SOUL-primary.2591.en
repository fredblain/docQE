"Brand protection" in China: if Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese 
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well. 
But what is Armani Polo? 
There is an officially registered name across China, which does not have anything to do with the original companies. 
Yet it is so long as the real names do not complain. 
And even then, it is not clear whether they are right. 
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas, a lawyer in the law firm Taylor Wessing, the protection of rights abuses in the Far East. 
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk. 
The Nachahmers are already a few extra letters, so that they can register their names. 
It is simply out of Gucci Lu-Gucci, rather than Prada Prada-Kny. 
Similarly, German companies will be legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma. 
This opens up a file with information of the Community Trade Mark Office in Beijing. 
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name, which is also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. 
The fact that the Chinese champion in copying and injured intellectual property, is well known. 
In the big cities, there are mehrstöckig supermarkets, which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting. 
Pocket cases are different: on behalf of his clients, however, that Chinese companies from the Trademarks Agency officially received the right to use a name, which already is protected elsewhere. 
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai," a passenger name. 
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan." 
This means that women who are wealthy men. 
The Chinese authorities are not aware 
"This is harmful, we must fight it," calls for stalemate. 
"The brand will be diluted, the damage is enormous." 
The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected industries are going into the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten. 
According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing. 
But Löschungen dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money. 
Up to nine years, the process can drag on, with an uncertain outcome. 
Reports of cases in which complaints prompted the court, because after the long duration of the name of "market reality." 
If the plaintiff bad luck, he had the Plagiator even pay money because he violated its brand in China, says this hole. 
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. 
Famous cases include graphic details. 
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the baumaschinen manufacturer Sany, the company, which was recently the German champion, pumpen took over. 
The Chinese must now use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star. 
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue white logo, which reminded us of BMW; the dispute has been resolved, Geely has had to change it. 
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile could look in the other direction. 
The Chinese authorities are not aware. 
The Trademarks Agency in Beijing CTMO is that 2010 due to reduced personnel and equipment shortages. 
Last year was one of the "emergency business returned to normal." 
The unbearbeiteter appeals procedure has fallen by 22%. 
Nearly 57 such cases have been completed, 75 per cent more than last year. 
However, there are still 81 500 objections to settlement. 
By contrast, it costs a lot 
As so often happens in China, the figures are impressive. 
In the past year, the CTMO is more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010. 
This is a record and meant that China, for the tenth consecutive year the list of Neuanmeldungs around the world, shares with the authority. 
This also applies to the stock of all the valid trademark, a total 5.5 million piece. 
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees earned. 
Simplified, this means that each registering an average of 1280 yuan or costs 160 euros. 
On the other hand, it would cost many times, as in the case of the German family company the mountain shows. 
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese Plagiator. 
While the Germans were able to achieve its illegal manufacture the imitation of motor vehicle parts has been unearthed. 
But the followers pledged to keep the Chinese rights to the brand of joy. 
We have failed, because in Germany, family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of the Chemical speciali ties in Munich. 
The Trademarks Agency CTMO rejected the objection of Munich as well. 
In the next two bodies, the mountain is right, but the trial is still continuing. 
You have to watch your step 
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court. 
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. 
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely expensive and is costing us much time, money and nerve." 
The internal costs could not quantify the company's archives have even a hundred years old files to prove them. 
Five years ago, the mountain on the other side in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to settle. 
"This shows how much it is worth," Wentzler says. 
The dangers in the Far East are even zurückzuschwappen in Europe. 
Then, when there are imitators unprotected brands. 
It was a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, known as the mountain of shoes and leather. 
This business has long since abandoned the company, but he was able to avert the registration. 
"You have to watch your step," Wentzler says. 
Both he and the lawyer advising German companies for doing business with China to be very careful. 
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, but rather should foreigners ," everything is somehow worthy, even in China," Wentzler says. 
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration. 
In fact, if the mountains in the last act of his Markendramas, then we should do the opposite fees pay for your own name, Wentzler said. 
Or we will be forced out of the market in this segment.
