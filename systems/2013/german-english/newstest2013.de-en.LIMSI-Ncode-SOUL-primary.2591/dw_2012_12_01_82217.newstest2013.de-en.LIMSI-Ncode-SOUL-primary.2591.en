Szabo said: "Germans must play a greater role." 
Germany has been in the vote on the admission of Palestine to abstain. 
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europ√§ische relations, so that Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level. 
German wave: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it opposed the request for observer status of the Palestinian people would vote at the United Nations. 
Then there was Berlin. 
Why? 
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza. 
It is now time for Germany, because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be cautious. 
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position. 
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, too critical of Israel. 
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstained when it came to set up a no-fly zone. 
This was, after all, enforced by NATO. 
Germany, where it is difficult to take a clear position on major international issues? 
Yes, it is true. 
This is because it is surrounded by its foreign policy and away from a policy which has been gemanaged by the United States, towards a German foreign policy. 
To make matters worse, the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy. 
The Germans are among the sides. 
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed. 
I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the path to becoming a "normal" foreign policy. 
A foreign policy, such as France or Britain. 
What constitutes a "normal" foreign policy as concrete from a German perspective? 
It shows the willingness of national interests to take positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners. 
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. 
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent differently than those of the other major powers, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests. 
Have these economic interests to influence the stance on the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? 
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states. 
This is why it must be careful that the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries not to offend. 
In any case, this is playing a role. 
But I would not want to attach a great deal of weight, which is not a completely one-sided relationship. 
But in any case it plays an important role in German considerations. 
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by important decisions to abstain in the vote on Palestine? 
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States, there is great sympathy for the German position. 
This is why I do not believe that this was a very dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue. 
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for einspielen. 
Because it is a signal that it will be taken seriously as an international player, and its interests must be taken into account. 
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative. 
The United States has clearly expressed its support for a veto. 
Are there any differences between the United States and many European nations? 
In view of the US domestic policy, these differences still exist. 
I believe that the government of President Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position. 
But because of the political situation here, the government in public, of course, does not represent this position. 
I believe that the real differences are not as large as they always seem to be. 
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so hellauf enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies. 
If Germany hard, its close relations with Israel and the United States, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other hand? 
I think that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans. 
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case. 
So they cannot be part of a wider line and have instead things from their own position. 
This is exactly what we are doing with the euro. 
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position. 
That, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel. 
This has always been a sensitive issue. 
But I believe that the Germans are aware that they have to play a more independent role. 
If Germany itself in its role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a key role? 
Or is Germany, the leadership is still serious? 
Germany is still not used to, which is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role. 
If we look at the example of the euro crisis, because every time when Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German sentiments. 
That makes it not easy. 
This is actually the old problem: you are not surrounded by hostile countries. 
In this respect, Germany is in a much tougher position than the United States. 
It is sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and that is not easy. 
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, the EU currently fills this void but not who is otherwise? 
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role. 
Even if they do not like it, they are uncomfortable, and makes them much less popular - c'est la vie!
