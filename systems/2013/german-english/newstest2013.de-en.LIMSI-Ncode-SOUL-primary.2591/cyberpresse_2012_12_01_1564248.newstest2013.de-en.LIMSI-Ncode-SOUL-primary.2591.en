A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama 
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight the electoral fraud. 
However, the Brennan Center, the latter is a myth, by reiterating that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning. 
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States, in fact, only 300 cases of electoral fraud. 
One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on the turnout. 
In this sense, undermine these measures, in part, the democratic system of the United States. 
In contrast with Canada, the US states for the conduct of the elections in the Member States responsible. 
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedure for the registration or ballot boxes. 
This phenomenon after the elections in November 2010 has gained in importance, where 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states. 
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced only in 2011, which restrict the exercise of voting rights in 41 states. 
The new electoral laws require that the voters a card and a proof of the US civil schaft. 
In addition, these laws also shorten the period of the early voting, the law declared invalid, on election day to register as voters and citizens denied the electoral law, for which a court acts. 
Before the elections of 2006, no US state of the electorate required to produce a card. 
Indiana was the first state of such a requirement. 
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law. 
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states. 
In the course of the last two years, they drove in 34 states, with which the voters are forced to produce a card. 
It is important to note that US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card. 
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible people not by a governmental authority of their state card. 
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card. 
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay, in order to obtain the necessary ID card. 
Among the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected. 
In fact, 25% of an African American, 15% of people with an income of less than 35 000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary card. 
This goes further. 
The students, who are seen as voters increasingly cast their votes for Democratic candidates, it is not permitted in several states, their card issued by the body to use. 
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs, which elect more on the Republican side, the tickets issued by these clubs to use for elections. 
Before 2004, not a federal state for the electorate called for proof of citizenship. 
Arizona was the first federal state, which instituted a similar requirement. 
In 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their US citizen schaft. 
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote. 
It is clear that two of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. 
In addition, Republican legislators have 2011 laws promoted in eight states, with which the registration of voters on election day has been abolished. 
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who want to register. 
These restrictions are not without consequences. 
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the general elections in 2004 helped to register some 10 million citizens. 
Since 2009 adopted measures, the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared with 2006. 
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states pass laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote. 
For example, in the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance, an African American, even though they only account for 13% of voters in the federal state. 
The same is true of the Hispanic population. 
The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance. 
In contrast, whites, which represented 76% of voters, only 46% of voters, who voted in advance. 
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of the electorate. 
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors. 
The Attorney General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial legislation. 
They were able to partially limit the damage. 
For example, only 16 of the 34 states pass laws that require the colleagues of a card. 
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of electoral law. 
The Democratic critics point the finger at the partisan nature of the laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the 2012 key states. 
A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that those states which have passed these laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college are needed to win the presidency. 
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system has a considerable impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012. 
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on the turnout. 
In this sense, undermine these measures, in part, the democratic system of the United States.
