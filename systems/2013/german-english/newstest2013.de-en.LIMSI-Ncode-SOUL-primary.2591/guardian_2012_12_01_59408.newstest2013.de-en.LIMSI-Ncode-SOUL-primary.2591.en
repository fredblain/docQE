Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging in force 
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packets, which are the same for all tobacco brands 
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging are in force in Australia, in order to brand logos and colors will be replaced by neutral, oliv green lid, which are also printed with graphic images, which sick body parts and by cigarette smoke sick infants and children. 
Among the various health warnings and pictures, apart from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs of the brand names, which are printed in identical, small letters. 
This means that Australia is the world's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging. 
The Australian Federal Government wants to see young people smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco use will be eliminated. 
It is the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke, with 99% probability will no longer start. 
"You can already see in children young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to compete with their brand image," Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quotes studies, for example, have shown that children are the crown of a logo associated with the idea of a princess. 
Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little effect on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures. 
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law. 
For example, it was said that the legislation would encourage the black market trade, resulting in cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes. 
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco. 
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will be far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia. 
Others, however, say that the rules have boosted their business. 
Sandra ha of Zico Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone cap to cover the unbearable packaging has grown enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the top Australian Court failed with its appeal against the law. 
Zico have up to 6 000 units sold in wholesale shops and waiting for new stocks. 
For us, this is a good business. 
Experts say that is the flaw in the popularity of social media in precisely the population group, in which the plan. 
A number australischer laws, tobacco companies banned from the TV-Werbung, it forbids them to act as a sports sponsors, and the vast majority of traders being forced to sell cigarettes in shops no longer to be interpreted, and now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet. 
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sides, but has no influence on the international side. 
"Who left tobacco marketed and only a small area, in order to advertise its products, is not on the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney. 
In the social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook gave Freeman an increase of feedback on brands identified by "ordinary people." 
It is the question: is it just a private individual who so much likes marlboro cigarettes that they even include a video - or a marketing agency has to do with it? 
British American Tobacco says that the industry, rather than concentrating on marketing to deal with the new laws. 
It has even gone so far, Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay to challenge the new rules, those countries complain about unfair trade practices at the World Trade Organization, even though none of the countries increased trade with Australia. 
A WTO ruling is expected in 2013. 
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries which are considering similar legislation. 
Canada was the first country to mandating photographic warnings. 
In the meantime they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. 
Tougher laws are being contemplated in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India. 
Many Australian smokers are defiant. 
The images do not affect me. 
I simply ignore them. 
"It is simply a bad way, and the box is away," says Victor El Hage with the purchase of a cigarette packet on which a photograph is printed with a mouth tumor. 
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl. 
James Yu, manager of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the inner city of Sydney, says that the single packaging was stacking his shelves more difficult. 
"In the past, I have spent an hour with a einzusortieren delivery, and now I do not need four," says Yu. 
"The government should have cigarettes simply completely ban - then we would have said okay, that's it, we are close," he adds visibly angry.
