In a constant air world, it is nice to be bored 
This thank giving, I spent five hours at the airport, when our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight. 
I had enough time to give me a few thoughts on boredom. 
I do not want to lie. 
A half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite nervous killing - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, duty-free shopping) are available. 
But more and more academics and child development experts have boredom as something positive. 
If it goes to them, it is for us - and our children - OK, sometimes bored. 
This means that the brain is forced to lose in interesting ideas, which may promote the creativity. 
And because most of us today are almost always on the one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom is no longer available. 
We should therefore welcome the boredom with open arms? 
Yes. 
And no. 
This is what I would like to come back. 
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure time. 
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), this is not the case. 
"In fact, boredom is a very long history," he says. 
The Pompejis signs a Latin inscriptions about boredom, which originates in the first century. 
Then there is the question as to how we boredom actually define. 
John D. East wood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada says that the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed. 
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor East wood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, "a satisfactory job to do, but not to be able to define what it is." 
Boredom is different from apathy to the effect that the person is not employed, but he wants to. 
In the case of apathy, however, there is no desire to do anything. 
The experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of the interest process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly." 
Boredom can listen almost as much as depression. 
But Professor East wood believes, even though these two conditions could see bored people the problem in their area or the world, while the problem people see in themselves. 
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even though we have very difficult to concentrate. 
In their study, "the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention" - German, for example: "The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor East wood and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listen to a band, in which a person read a magazin article. 
Some groups have heard a loud television channel from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content; others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear this noise at all. 
The people who were barely audible television, saying they were more boring than the two other groups - they have had problems to focus, for no reason and wrote their difficulties of boredom. 
If you try to concentrate on a difficult or arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. 
If, however, a dull professional activity, "such as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor can distract music and help not bored." 
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, they can fight even by people who are physically more alert. 
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit," Professor Fenske. 
We are all at some point boring - my delayed flight, a sensational loudspeaker, a particularly tedious film. 
But some people bore more easily than others. 
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of boredom." 
On the scale, there are statements such as "many things that I must do is repeat and monotonous" and "I have so many interests, that I was not enough time for all." 
With the help of such scales researchers have found that boys are more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West florida, especially as regards the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli. 
But in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter bunch. 
In 1991, Reed Larsen who, professor of human and gemeinwesen development at the University of Illinois, through an experiment in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times on the day with a Pager kontaktierte. 
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and let the house were bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school. 
But only 3% of parents said they bored. 
Professor Larsen who says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom has risen or fallen. 
But he is sure that "youth is seen as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine. 
Back then, on my original question: is boredom healthy? 
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and gambling or drugs to alleviate them, the studies have shown. 
On the other hand look at many philosophers and authors of the relationship between boredom and creativity, and this view is Professor Vodanovich, who studied for more than two decades. 
"With the boredom, the brain is to say that you should do something else," Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York. 
But the brain does not always know what you should do best. 
If one is boring and the energy used to play and cook Gitarre, will be happy. 
But television can make short-term sense, they vanish over the long term but again. 
If his bored child is an iPad enough, it can distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to maintain itself or to control, says Professor Fenske. 
And he adds: "Self-regulation is transferring from a situation to the other." 
The child learns not only to entertain, but it also receives more self-regulation in other areas. 
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom. 
Similarly, we should not be critical. 
Instead, our aim should be to get away from the constant Aktivit√§ts and berieselung at ease. 
Professor East wood agrees. 
"It sounds as we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says. 
He believes that people really just want to find a way to switch off and relax. 
"In an environment in which we are constantly stimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is silent."
