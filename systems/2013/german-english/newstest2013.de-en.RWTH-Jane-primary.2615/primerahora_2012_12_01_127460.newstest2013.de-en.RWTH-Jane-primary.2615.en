Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life '
The globetrotter contrast, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was linked to the basket more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of the history of the country in May as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, was Rexes part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player and manager in the lower classes, players of the first national league, BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My whole life I have drafted me in basketball many hats, including several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the Association in the 90 s," recalled Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora, at his home in Bayamón, where he with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes not exaggerating with this statement.
Almost all the walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and.
Bayamón in the heart
The stirs memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50 s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary and has been further or directors of the club.
"These were my best years I have enjoyed most, because I was to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a managing director, has been further or coach.
There were many play successive years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of debuts by Jerome Mincy BSN.
Then, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "says Reyes.
I know that genes bar, as a trainer worked here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was employed, said: "I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.
Do you want? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players ever, Puerto Rico.
Then recommended to the free throw Raymond Gausse specialists and was one of our best shooter.
I remember, as he said that if possible Mincy had a championship for Bayamon, would make Gausse for another.
The championship of the vaqueros with Gausse was granted him, but even from a distance, because he was already 1988 at the top of the class.
At the time, he its application and to enjoy the Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we were the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if this Canadian referee, we would not have been the last move was repeated for the second time, said Reyes.
This group was the 1990 World Cup the best national team, you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won in the 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite is the team of the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and the U.S. gave the team a fight, as when they won they were against us in the World Cup bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but we won a gold medal and gave us great pleasure of the vorolympischen tournament was 1995 in the La Plata, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, against all odds we won the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking account of his career in the different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coach like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Arman Dito Torres.
Of the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the best that you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 90 years he up to 17 teams in a season.
What can you do?
There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and meet in the national playoffs teams from other corners of the island.
Today, many children unnecessary trips and games.
At least I can see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I would like to listen to music, watch videos of music my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
