The film Argo: When's the worst that Hollywood call
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled for their release after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime.
For the American Government out of this situation, there was no positive way - she could not afford to throw the Shah, as this would have damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in a position in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt by the hostage liberation made it even worse.
The diplomats were released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages home a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film, the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the U.S. a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff were able to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; it helped them an extravagant story for covering up their true identity - they with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film, which allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The experts for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan, Hollywood's cooperation.
This was the camouflage credible, published articles about this film project in journals, there were held press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is an unique combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called "Aquascapers Movie" is, the story of a successful job, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film's mood levels - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence showing iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, therefore, the ironic and slightly exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, the official corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck succeeded with this film a remarkable start to his career.
From a bel√§chelten actor has become a respected director, and also as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film in the no children (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in the local Boston by director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that contrasted this director's previous films from the Hollywood standard.
Affleck demonstrates this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have taken place - the main sequence of the storming of the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and it conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when signalizations moves the story.
A similar effect Affleck and his team also in fictional scenes (the wrong film crew at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much plot in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
But he working with the little, but sometimes he nachhilft reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which will avert the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or the chase on the runway, the most fun).
The weakness of Argo is his overly broad distribution, which is due to the need to show too much to act in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, their figures but deserved more space, but they are in the film is far from alone.
Afflecks film loses a little traction. It is a movie, with some interest, and the design and the age of a thriller from 70 to approve years. Without style.
However, he awakens enthusiasm.
Until today in some way as a reminder of a living piece of history and as proof of how excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is enough.
