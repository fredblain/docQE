"The people that I want to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," said Okamura.
Mr Senator, how to get the idea to run for the presidency?
It is not about me, senator or president.
If everything would work in our country without problems, I would run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how plundered the Republic for 20 years, as thieves, while increasing people's taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And while I am over 40, and independent and party-less, I have no other way to influence things, a senator or presidential candidate.
In the Senate, you have made it and then straight on the road to the castle.
You do not turn our backs on your constituents?
I told me the whole time that I will take the fight to for the castle on the outcome of the Senate elections.
This later clarified and I said that I will run for the presidency, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realise my vision.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
The problem is not just that we, as people in the pub and in front of the television, but anyone who wants to change something.
To confuse then there are the media who want to the, and to lie with the freedom of speech and freedom.
About me, it was said, for example, that I would impress journalists or that I was an adviser by Jiří Paroubek.
We talk about your vision.
The struggle for the castle you have included with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retrospective asset declarations about 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have endeavoured to keep the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, that's not on purpose, and that keeps the population only.
As an independent party, I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that I can take without drawers thinking and party dogma of each party what is the best for our country.
You see as a person in the policy right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left.
For me, this left-right thinking but totally irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we make progress.
My point is not whether people on the left or the right, I would like to unite the people.
I always support any good approach, even if it comes from the KSM or the ODS, and even so will I go against bad ideas.
It you, if someone calls you as populists.
But do not confirm it by what you have just said?
If you add in a company a business plan, then you have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that you want to move.
You can call it as far as populism, but all the proposals, which I have spoken to work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament telepad remain just slogans.
And so that you are not in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that you, if you talk long enough with the people will be able, for example, the material and impose criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them to our side, to achieve these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me to ask the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And the home-owners may then have to say why they reject.
A strong personality, which refers to irregularities, can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President, who was a credit to the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur and I am neither a genius nor an intellectuals.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I started with the policy and just trying to find my programme for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the situation for themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I am in six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I do not alone, and that is why I have spoken with several famous people on whether they want to run for the Senate.
For example, I have spoken with Radim Janura, but rejected due to.
In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the fraud in the sale of light fuel oil.
My candidacy, I began with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the polls, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that will be very difficult to implement changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not thought about it, because I don't have the time to review the past every potential party member, and not have the money.
I have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account for only 20,000 CZK.
They have no money?
You talk about asset declarations, what would you?
I appreciate my private assets to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Kodu Superb, which is worth about one million. And and then I have a few million in the account.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he was driving in the car, gallantly to women, and fighting against evil.
You are driving an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the Republic, but you do not want to invest your own money.
That is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I do about debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that the my program probably does not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to make the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will gedecktVVPP basically through my salary as a senator.
But the senators salary, I could not live alone; I could not fund my son the English school, which costs Euro30,000 per month.
If I wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
Stay as long as an entrepreneur, to have your livelihood?
You said that you will return these activities?
But that does not depend on the level of salary.
As promised, I have reduced my activities.
For example, is my deputy CEO of the travel agents in the spring,.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan, saving the republic.
But I have to live by.
Monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and it remains so.
As president, I would stop my.
