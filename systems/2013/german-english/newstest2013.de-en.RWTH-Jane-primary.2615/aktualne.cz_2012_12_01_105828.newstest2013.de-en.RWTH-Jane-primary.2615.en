Nkú chief: control of the Black system through the fault of the failed policy
The Czech Republic, in the context of public contracts on good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, but in their application.
In the conversation for Aktuá ln.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme control office (Nejvyí kontrolní úad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be used correctly - and I think this is not the case with us," said of the current situation.
A similar result is to be a common control by Czech and German firms.
As bad practice on the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "Black system."
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would annoy the entrepreneurs with controls - so the system is banned or permitted?
"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then simply cannot come from the government's chairman, and the monitoring office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work," Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common Czech / German project, the both countries "laws on public contracts.
What was it?
It is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is important that establishes the European legislative to handle public contracts to build the national legislations, and finally, there is the real practical application..
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps a little "strict and perfect," but the actual application is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not new, and more detailed rules. We must deal with the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project for you? What emerges from this project?
It is precisely this kind of joint control could help to stop us constantly to the laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds, if this did not seem particularly positive.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to buy and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
It may even be that the system in this way, only the excessive burden "paperwork" and those who look for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold values higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
To as far as the authorities, the German counterpart the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us, and also on a college, which will be formed only slightly different. Basically, both authorities are similar.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, a federal state, which means that there is also in the individual federal states - is the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can only monitor federal funding, which is our state funds.
Public funds is managed by the counties and municipalities, are subject to the control of the national courts of auditors.
As regards the German legislation is easier than ours?
In general I would compare it without specifics reluctant. Nevertheless Germany is in some ways, often described as a model, but say that Germany in particular is better.
That is because the auditors are better?
That is certainly not, but I don't particularly like, such comparisons.
It should be noted here that even those countries that have a model for us, are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, isn't it?
As regards the Czech legislation, your authority had the revision of the procurement law, do you feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests.
As our controls, you have to be here with some delay.
Impact we feel in the preparatory phase of the future controls - we have the new instrument of control "detection of risks of inefficiency" and examined with this almost 14,000 public contracts and here, the changes will affect change, of course, the threshold values, modified the conditions for certain types of contracts, etc.
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption.
It may occur, however, the problem is that the rules be "tough" and can no longer be met.
Under the previous rules are that they a Prfung underlined people against the carrier (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) an are not accountable to any breach of the public procurement law a violation of budgetary discipline.
But it is to make the law more stringent?
I do not believe that in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not to punish those who have made a formal errors, which does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the solution?
We say first of all, what is not the.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs would bother with controls of the so-called "Black system" - what does that mean exactly?
The system is banned or permitted?
A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then simply cannot come from the government's chairman, and the monitoring office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work.
He can say: "we will change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do so, as if it were nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded due to procedural errors alone.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly - and that is what we are lacking.
