Singapore babies to save the economy
The blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the cost of housing and child.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for a mint candies, but nevertheless, or precisely because - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as "is pushing a" bao " (loaf) in the oven to worry about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who shot the video, preserves the hope that the advert on the way to raise awareness of the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton said that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to their "national duty."
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
In Fort plant, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that there is an issue that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume or with under the organization of Speed Dating evenings (rapid flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily succeed.
So we thought: Why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this issue lightly, the Government of Singapore.
Every year, they are $1,300 for political action to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax advantages.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a wealthy, hi-tech city-state in South East Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of national civil authority, says that it is in a "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to marry and to have to form a family much more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she says.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of people living alone and the delay of the marriage and birth, is the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to counter the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for low wages and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on economic growth in a nation that tax revenues, the cost of health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore also unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve, not so many small apartments.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes" and cannot be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a residential area of 46 square metres and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can support the lifestyle of living alone, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company El Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" to sell much more quickly than larger apartments.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
It is, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small residential units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, is the talks with the Singapore, working in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are stressed, the housing and education are expensive, so it will be delayed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get other.
"It is important for me, on my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women run their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that they cannot have children.
, for the last word when it comes to have children - because the government can do so much.
