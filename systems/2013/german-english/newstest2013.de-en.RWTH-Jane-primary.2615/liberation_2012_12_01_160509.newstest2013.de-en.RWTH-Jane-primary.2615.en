A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which gives him unlimited power temporarily, more divided than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket.
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day his final version.
The head of state had granted just a week ago this House two additional months to complete its work.
For almost two years now Egypt is based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only for even greater division of the country.
For his opponents of the president in his "autocratic delirium," he continues to "breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the side of his supporters are assured that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of, forcing the brothers to abandon their plans to explain the Egyptians the text section for section.
It is also a way for the president, to his public and democratic legitimacy, while protests raging across the country.
As you have heard in an interview with the American Wochenschau Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people will be charged with this recourse to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either agrees for my draft or I am the unlimited power," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution to an end.
85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent assembly approved the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have tended to move, because they believe that they are not able to express their views.
Representatives from human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have been equally.
To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members, added.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... The time has come for the prayer, because some members were of the opinion that the pendulum clock was not of the constituent assembly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, drew all the attention, after all, identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped, "the principles" by "the rules," which would have made a stronger application possible.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has been amended, proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" of the liberals, who see it as nothing more than propaganda.
The Islamisation of the Constitution via other articles.
They are especially Article 220, which grants the University of Al Azhar an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of the compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Ã„gyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier is worrying, because "the people who are being asked to give its opinion, have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
You can see that the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the university of should be much less moderate than the present.
"There is no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no Ulema, but academics, who have been trained in the French system, "appeased Alexis Blouet who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits, "that may be in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity, as are the terms used borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "fiqh," Islamic jurisprudence.].
And in the future could be raised the question of to what extent are competent civilian judges to decide. "
In addition to his criticism of the religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday sharply because of the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they are reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military will be submitted to the examination of the defence budget to Parliament, but a national defence council.
Just as there will be no ban on civilian trials in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
They also share their concerns with regard to the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Moreover, no article refers more to the protection of women, Palestinian Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
They believe that the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to say on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march Saturday.
