My Mexican American identity crisis.
Due to the lack of opportunities, many people were forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times, he says
Navarre popotte believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, wide.
Signs pointed to two queues, one for "Mexican Wochos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Number" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and has been all my life, "Mexicans."
An ethnic symbol - just am friends in Boston "Irish" or "Italians" call my friends in New York.
Later, I opted for "Mexican" / ."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or binding.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to say in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not go.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for registration.
I thought about that moment this week, as did the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues which are expected to meet the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans remain today, with a high degree of probability in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc after the European Union.
Mexico's Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single idea that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and forced the country's leadership under vorgehaltenem gun to leave them more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries rather than in minutes, the memories of this event.
So once, an U.S. government official mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites, the country's - complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour's.
And the Monte Zuma's children on the.
And yet, in truth, is the biggest challenge in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - offered no chance in Mexico, and in the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
In Mexico.
And while we may be living the American dream, good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred at times, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is certainly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and looking down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never strong enough.
They believe our existence is a symbol of failure.
If not failed our families in Mexico, they would have.
And then we would not be caught behind the silk curtain now see - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and einwanderte legally as a child in the United States, I am reminded that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans blame them.
While it is an U.S. citizen, as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling of, neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And we are seen as Mexicans in the United States.
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes it even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education and want to record their links to the diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid, because you alone,.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a year and a half centuries, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a, for what happened to their family members so long ago.
Hmmm).
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.
