Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for her views
It was always my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought to the largest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - did.
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College at the end of the eighties -, I had intended to study history - I had packed my suitcase and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I had a problem that had students in neighboring rooms.
The author of A N Wilson said, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
We were harassed me for one reason only - a that seemed in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment to so narrow and cruel: My late father now Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, recent reports indicate is a new generation of students of the moderate rights under similar prosecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week called for the same protection, equality of gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said that they are often isolated because of their political views "active, attacked personally and declared undesirable."
They are calling for a place in the equality Nominierungskomitee their college to ensure that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students screened on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been shown, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association at the University of Oxford, who drove an and silver suit and silberbesetztem Go flaunted Tock.
Conservative students at other universities say they are as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing tendency to link universities.
People say we are like the cyber-bulling Don club, without us ever get to have. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie, Ill, says the President of the conservative student association of Oxford, they have seen members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford I was such a minority.
As I was unbelievably timid 18-year-old in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student - to give due to cuts in higher education has no official title.
The atmosphere could have been even Stalinists.
In the first days of the week, get to know the new students and tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the the mockery of Tory students only tolerated, but even with joy.
Political issues such as the miners "strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English. On what should have been, I was not taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a pie dough, and quite unpleasant.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are you just stupid?" He asked me.
The kicherten other students.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take in your spare time a few French hours - that is, if you are not too busy with your social activities," growled am Pitt.
I returned with h√§ngendem head in my room.
That evening I was in college at the dinner alone, I tippte someone typed me slightly on the back.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory, harassed her.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be for you.
Most Tory first-year purport to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I later tried to distract me.
I insisted that I was not entirely agree with Mrs Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A first-year professional philosophy, politics and economy, which, ironically, had visited as a conservative force Eton College, said to me: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"As the Tories sex?," asked me one.
The to beat each other, or?
I felt I had to have felt the same way as homosexuals from the more liberal legislation in the United States.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
I would like to meet with like-minded after nightfall?
I should the Labour Party and to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me, I extended my intellectual eye to a purgatory of condemnation and isolation.
The only tutor, who announced himself as a Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in matters of foreign policy advice and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy," he said.
I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
They never would do something, not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my Communist friends, always impeccable manners.
That tarnished his moist eyes.
Give it a chance.
I am sure that we neckt you.
It would break my heart if you were walking.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to pressure and put his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, which claimed another history tutor, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I zerging secretly in shame, I saw that my parents had a "brainwashing," and called them "old idiots."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who was the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes gave my Reaver.
As they went, I grabbed a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz).
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer in a school with such intimidation and spite.
And it is tragic that it was an university of Oxford -, which did not only 14 Tory, but until now hidden behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
