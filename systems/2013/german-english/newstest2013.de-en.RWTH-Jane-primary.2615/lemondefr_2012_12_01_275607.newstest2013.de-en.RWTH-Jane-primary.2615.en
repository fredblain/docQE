Real estate major scandals in Quebec
Officials of the roads, companies in the building industry sector, political parties and fundraisers specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system," in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990 s and 2000 s.
"It is strange how the system, since it has taken drastic measures," Sperling jokes Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Montreal in Quebec and a former head of the police.
The scandal was exposed by him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the treaties to road construction in Quebec, who agreed to the then prime minister reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the study in 2010," he said, "the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars of the Treaties," because some zügelten its instinct to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors on a case-by-case basis," he adds, in the hope that it can "to show the tactics behind the individuals."
Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit
Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit is with its troops to auditors, investigating and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police force, "and was," which since 2009 has ensured that the "sewer cartel" Montreal is in the artificial inflation of of the Treaties cautious...
In recent weeks it has made a series of raids and made allegations of fraud and corruption against local officeholders, such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city, has resigned.
He is suspected of repeatedly received in exchange for public contracts bribes.
Incidentally, engineers were specifically accused of road construction official from Montreal, and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has attracted attention by the Commission of the operation of the "system" has declared for the preservation of public contracts.
He himself has paid for several years in Montreal received 3% of the value of the contracts to a broker linked to the Mafia, who gave the money to the Union, the party of mayors Geraldine Tremblay.
Mr Zambito everywhere in the 2000 s has had his hand in the game by more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time.
He also confessed to organising an illegal fund-raising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normand Jauneau.
Sewerage contracts, the costs of have been artificially inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described in detail the Commission: in ten years ago, he received from the construction company gifts and invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts, whose cost it artificially pumping up.
Other Road Administration officials have admitted that they did, by aufblähten smear the bills with false services artificially by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget, filled its coffers with undeclared money.
As a result of these revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which left Montreal in a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau, was one of the first Members of Montreal, proposed the alarm.
As mayor of the District Rivière of Prai Ries, in the east of the island, they declined from 2010 against the sale of municipal land that bought for $5 million and was sold for 1.6 million of property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
The study, conducted at the end of the, she says that it "takes on a thread, which it to understand the operation of the suspected of ants system to stop this evil and denounce those responsible."
She says that the process "painful, but positive."
We are about to clean the wound, but need a certain investigative unit, only for Montreal and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How do you clean.
Regularly.
For its part, Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but especially concerned about the role of "office holders, who are the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
Based on a 70% share of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is a poor substitute for reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, according to what he would change nothing about the situation: "as long as the election campaign spending will be strictly limited, black money in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing of the parties: "we must not go deeper; when we get to the bottom with courage, we can can build a house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story is damaging the international image of Quebec in Montreal, calls Mr Duchesneau those who laugh about it, to look in their own backyard...
