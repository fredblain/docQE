"Trademark protection" in China: If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese.
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what Armani Polo?
A designation officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original company.
However, as long as it enjoys protection, the actual name donors do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they will get justice.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas stalemate hole, a lawyer in the law firm Taylor Wessing, which is in the Far East.
A new case every week ends up on my desk.
The clones are already a few extra letters, so that they can register their brands.
So Gucci, Prada gives simply Lu Gucci, Prada Kny you enter.
German companies are legally copied in this way, for example, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a folder with the of the trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protecting the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese world champion in the copying and injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are mehrstöckige department stores that sell almost exclusively.
But the cases are different: his clients he goes against that Chinese companies receive officially have from the Trademark Office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "bang Jian-Ming Pai," a passenger.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
Women who rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
"That is, we must fight will jeopardize it," says stalemate.
"The brand will, the lone position, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA is China, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deletions dubious trademark registry entries are hard to reach and go into money.
The process can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Stalemate hole reported cases in which the court lawsuit claims, because after the long duration of the disputed name to "market reality."
If the plaintiff have bad luck, he would have to pay the Plagiator even money because he injured his brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction equipment manufacturer GGR, a company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker cleaning.
To date, the Chinese must therefore use a logo similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyers Geely originally used a blue and white logo which recalled BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion maker Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing is that there have been 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
But last year was one of the "emergency in the workflow returned to normality."
As part unbearbeiteter appeals procedure had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, in the office still 81,500 appeals on completion.
On the other hand, to address costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, when CTMO went more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is the tenth consecutive year, a record and that give China the list of applications around the world, shares the authority.
This also applies to the of all the valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 had been taken over 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
Put simply, this means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
The fight against costs several times, as in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans have been able to do that was dug its illegal manufacturing imitation of motor vehicle parts.
But secured the Chinese rights to the brand of.
You did not do so, because it could not be protected in Germany family name, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Management of Freudenberg Chemical depending in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two instances Freudenberg was right, but the process opponents fighting.
We must use extreme caution
The matter is now before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and is costing us a lot of time, money and nervous."
The internal cost could be difficult to quantify, the company's archive had to look arcives even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, a "high six-figure euro amount" in Freudenberg the other side to settlement.
"This shows how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threaten to Europe.
Then, if there territory.What Doubles vulnerable brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration.
"We must use extreme caution," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole advising German companies to be very careful in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brands, but the foreigners "everything is somehow worth protecting, but also in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg last act of his trademark drama, then you would have to pay the other side licence fees for their own name, said Wentzler.
Or we are in the segment of the market.
