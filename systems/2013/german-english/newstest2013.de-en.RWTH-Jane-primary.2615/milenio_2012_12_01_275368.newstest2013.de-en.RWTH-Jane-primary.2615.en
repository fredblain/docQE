"South America must learn to the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that a goal is the creation of a common citizenship, and "South America can learn something from Europe."
Correa, who is the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru, that the Europeans "killed in the Second World War and other conflicts" and "are now virtually a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, the members countries of the Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; but there is still a reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on human rights.
Those who teach, never commit to something, and in exchange we sign the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington and financed by the United States," he said in to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, was granted.
Correa assured that he does not regret that decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that it "was at the time, that Assange extradited to a third country and would not be complied with procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which requires him to an interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence, while the Swedish law "allowed through a video conference on its territory the Embassy of Ecuador in London could have been carried out."
Correa said that there was a risk that would affect the health and mental state of Assange.
"He is in our message that I have not spoken with him, the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the Head of Ecuador.
There is a danger, though, that he would be physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a tight space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of all people," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted since the month of June in the Ecuador Embassy in London, is the granting of a free letter, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that it is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe's lies. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution to the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, that we do not apply in this case, however, there were ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because Assange's lawyer, Sanguineti Tsar Garzón, a series of procedures at various European forums," he said.
And "when Britain granted morning this, in my opinion, this is done."
And if Mr Assange to Sweden interrogated on the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype, as allowed under Swedish law and in other cases, be resolved the problem.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie that infringe the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador more dominated by such journalists "and not by bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries," and I think he took a re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism "must stand firm and no opportunism and no grieving as a legal coup d," because it "was destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador is also the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the verdict of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which places the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua to negotiate with the seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, is "absolutely right."
Currently, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between the South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be fully addressed, so that they can overcome and look forward.
Similarly, he said to a successful conclusion of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court that "it is right to go to international bodies for Latin America, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he presents himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to reach his third consecutive mandate, he admitted that he "sees this opportunity with optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he would lose the elections in February 2013 that he would retire from political life.
Has never interested me personally, but in doing so unjust circumstances such as these socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement, I had the belief that it was, which guaranteed the likely victory, so I must assume this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as President, I retreat from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"It is decided," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just finished with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had been planned for a routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
"It in no way means a return to the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.
