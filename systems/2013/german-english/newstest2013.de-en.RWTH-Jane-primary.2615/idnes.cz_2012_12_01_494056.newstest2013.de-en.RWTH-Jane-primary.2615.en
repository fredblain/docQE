The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work.
That decision provoked a lively debate among the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
"The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with each other.
The this is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) leads to price.
It is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper imported goods in economic competition, by undercutting the competition "" in order to grab a larger market share and to increase its profits.
This means on a large scale for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with high labour costs.
Because private capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for what he is necessarily caused unemployment, rising government spending.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the damage they have caused overall economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words: governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of the private sector, particularly in the field of wages.
This is done through economic coercion in long-term unemployment, partly by reducing workers "rights.
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there have been several years since public food outlets for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive a salary so low that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag revealed auxiliaries.
The austerity measures virtually all the EU southern states will no doubt be on the same condition, which people are being forced under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels, to emigrate (as in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society and hope that at some private investment capital flow into the country.
Here, the question naturally arises as to how this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam claim that the state must not be involved with capital in its own economy, and that a planned economy to economic disaster.
Private capital narrowly insists on his position that the state should not intervene to direct the economy.
Then you have to wonder whether the policy does not affect private capital and the entire state in their own selfish interests or draws.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, legislation in virtually anything criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the reality is that a State Department for lack of finances private, with the industry of legal businesses with the drafting of legislative proposals.
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer the people from the western constitutions, as, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are currently a situation that Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar's and "describes:" the state has been understood for a long time in the, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.
Corruption has grown unchecked, and the people with boughted votes went to the polls ..."" people with character not applied for posts as a result of this decline for eight months, so that the state had no consul ..."" You really began to talk about it, that is the only medicine an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man ..." Appian thought is to be in, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, democracy permanently replaced by the autocracy.
As it turns out, is today's society, as well as in ancient times based on of the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without looking at overall societal interests.
Private capital by its very nature, is not in a position to see the benefit of society as a whole.
The result, now, as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, who are not in the slightest for deeper reforms.
The cause for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the indiscriminate liberalisation of of the economies in the 19th and 20th century look.
Of the, the regime in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, in the next round.
Especially appalling is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on voluntary work is no solution, at least not lasting.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the level of social security of the population.
This trend is a systemic nature.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the state.
