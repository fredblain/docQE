Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but around the world.
The secret of the success of the country have to do something with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese varieties.
It platziere them a pile of dirty, humid sports clothing.
And leave it there for a week.
So the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you would have stinky fish - in water up to a year.
The darkness over the land, and the weather is colder in Norway, Norwegian at a festival in Fagernes, now, that this is really very eye-catching speciality.
"You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk General" organized the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take on large quantities of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Harvard.
The spirit can crowd out the smell.
I eat some.
Avoiding the Rakfisk in, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no cooling opportunities and was soaked fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In the deepest winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of theRule subdued - consumed alcohol.
Even a generation ago had thousands of Norwegians in search of work, to leave their country and mainly in the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not so long ago was far richer than Norway, are immigrants.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive meals, which can be bought here.
But everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs $10.
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that.
Still, to name Anders Breivik hates it here - those racist right-wing extremists, who last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, it referred only to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is in its peace-loving country to such brutal killings.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien since the early 1970 s, the growth of the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are so good," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with enthuse Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are a - as they say - sensible people.
Her English is just like that of most people here.
We are not, we may not redeem your boasting.
Norway has been very cautious with its oil wealth - a large proportion of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years leading up to the world economic crisis all money around, they had not hielt Norway.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk," it deals with easy laughter.
I am standing in the snow and another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
So a moose burgers is something else. The juicy meat goes down me.
But on the evening of Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several locations that organise a Rakfisk dinner where guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - can vote fish smell sense of.
There is a live TV circuit with a fly at show, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"
"Here are our points to Harvard."
We applauded laughs.
A man falls from his, perhaps overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict haze of the whole fish.
