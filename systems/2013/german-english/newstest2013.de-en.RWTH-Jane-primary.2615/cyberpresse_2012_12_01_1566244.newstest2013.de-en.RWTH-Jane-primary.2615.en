The Higgs boson analysed
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bos' last summer has caused a stir, and for good reason.
It is believed that the boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And it is the last particle whose existence the Standard Model - our best or the least "false" statement of nature and the behavior of matter -, predicted, but not been observed empirically.
But for the physicist, it is not yet completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs boson.
It seems to be confirmed by new data to be presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data to be completely secure.
We are assuming that it is indeed the Higgs, since there is apparently only a small risk of getting things wrong, and we look at what is at stake.
In this world there is inevitably a crucial law that that can't be two objects in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and do not try too hard, because you are hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it is also applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles can occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state," with a law "state" by and large, of some of its properties.
On this basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are known as Fermi one and obey polite the Pauli principles.
And in the other the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, which is nothing sacred not in any case, the precautionary principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same time, at the same place.
These bosons divided according to the website the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Greek barys, which we will deal with here and the "power particles," through which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson, would be used.
It must be stressed, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures, as you might think.
If you are able to read this story, then only thanks to a Bosons exceptional banality: the photon, or particle of the "light" that the "messenger" is of electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electric charge or change the direction of the electromagnetic field on this "disrupted," as a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "sources of power."
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, "disrupted," so that shows the boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface could be spall only by a very large rocks.
That is why a giant particle accelerator as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with an of 27 km! - In order to achieve this kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
It is not in fact all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - for example, would never keep a piece of paper from the fridge.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the other (like the photon) have no mass.
For all this research, "which can be good," says Mrs Plamondon?
For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all deviations between the observations and to investigate the predictions of the SM.
There are also many physicists who sincerely hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference open a door to a "new physics" and could fill a few holes of the model.
It must be said that there are still major shortcomings in the latter, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!), and the dark matter, which is about 80% of matter in the universe (again ups!).
But at the CERN such deviations were not found until now.
Impact
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 60 s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs have that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser in the 1960 s was invented 1962, and even the first laser (the first was NI) has developed - said that the laser at the beginning rather than a "gimmick."
Imagine...
In addition, there are also applications for all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, in turn, has developed warm Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the pulp a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose of this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has won him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC inevitably will change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...
