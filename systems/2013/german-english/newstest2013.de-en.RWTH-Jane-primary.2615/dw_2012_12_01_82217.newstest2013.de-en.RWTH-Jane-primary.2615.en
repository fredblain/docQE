Szabo: "Germans must play bigger role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S. European relations, Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level.
German first wave: Germany earlier this week had indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the beginning of the United Nations.
But then abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now must be Germany due to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was enforced by NATO.
Germany is finding it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
That is because it is surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States, as it were, to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, that Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
So the Germans find themselves trapped in the middle.
It is expected them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think that they their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions in on national interests, which are independent of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and therefore needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
We must be careful, the public, but also the elites, not to in the Arab countries.
It definitely plays a role.
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by abstaining from the vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic breakthrough, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will record a certain respect.
Because it signals that it will be taken seriously as an international player and must be given to its interests.
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States have come out clearly in favour of a veto.
There are differences between the U.S. and many European nations?
As a result of American domestic politics have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But due to the political situation, the government can not this position publicly, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all talking about Netanyahu's policies.
It is difficult to Germany's close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side?
I think that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead push things from their own position.
This is precisely what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future to push Europe into an European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans know that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a major role?
Germany is still the lead or difficult?
Germany is still not yet been used, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a greater role in the country.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti- German feelings.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
This is the old problem: You want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is seen in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States continually in European politics, the EU does not fill the vacuum at the moment but who is?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like, it makes them uncomfortable and it is even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
