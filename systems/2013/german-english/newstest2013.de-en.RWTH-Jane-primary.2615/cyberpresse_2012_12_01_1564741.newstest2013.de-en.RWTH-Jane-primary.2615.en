Prostate cancer screening: the test should not be made or?
In fact, the PSA test would sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater reluctance of undecided women for screening tests.
The test should not be made or?
We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous confounding factors between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret this data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the likelihood of metastasized by 30% to 40% higher if no screening was.
That is why I recommend the test at the age of 50 or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer.
In men of American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was identified.
There are cancers that aggressive and others who are indolent.
Really understand the magnitude of the risk of cancer the patients must be made by him to the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate crabs, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases to prefer an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many of the men, which is cancer, no treatment, not because their cancer is aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy determined the criteria for a decision that should be dealt with.
I therefore recommend the implementation of the tests.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA tests.

To prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eating well and will be sufficient.
"If there were no smoking, this value would rise at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers caused by inheritance.
Several remain unresolved.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
It seems the risk for breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and cervical cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout the entire life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In great quantity it increases the risk of developing a Grimm or rectal cancer.
Salami should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Currently, but their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society are the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
A study has found that reducing the risk of prostate cancer, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also has not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is to talk with his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
