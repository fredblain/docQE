Born in space
Earth at risk.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Of space ships carrying Erdbewohnern on the search for a replacement.
In order to save humanity, the important question of how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or the spare planet?
Many there is no choice in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planet, we could at least kādu hypothetical.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomical Institute of Šternberk Vladimir Surdin.
While the conditions on Mars relatively enjoyable, on the surface of Venus a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The researchers first dealt with the issue of reproduction in space on the flora.
A half-century earlier already carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the orbiting bred peas did not differ at all from the terraqueous species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to explore how the weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It is becoming a normal chicks.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chicks themselves; it must be able to stand on its legs and start to move," said the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid underground chicks have been.
Ten hours later stumpften fully the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
She died four days later.
"Twice we could slip chicks and did it, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew considers the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cages animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, on the Biosatelliten "and" are only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that fertilized already have been sent into space.
In principle, there was nothing special.
"It was with the Biosatelliten again, but it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue," said Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats.
The issue of reproduction in space could be resolved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are taken from their natural habitat, simply cannot follow their reproductive behavior.
Unlike animals could in.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments.
But women fly for 50 years.
The greatest risk in Tereshkova.
The Wertvollste with humanity, is the female body.
Our gull flew, and no one on earth would they can answer the following question: Übersteht space flight?
This flight, will be able to bring a child into the world?
"Finally, no one answered that question," says space veteran Tang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The child's father, Jan Nikola, was also.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja who twice in orbit, and is even working outside the space vehicle, a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut, where after long flights go well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Poliakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet the human race for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydraulic laboratory in the cosmonaut training center is a compulsory station during the flight.
Here in limbo win the cosmonaut routine for work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Although adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony that rose from life on the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get easier to water.
In principle this is logical, since from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child is the weightlessness of a much more natural state, is not the woman without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles very quickly and so that is the ability to extract the child.
Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tools.
For example, the birth could take place in a special chamber in order to extract the child.
"But what happens then?" Is not the important issue of Valery Poliakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravitational pull of the organism can form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child could not be put in orbit as an adult for training in a.
He is just missing what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment that we make together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will lead to a disabled person, a complete non-conformist will bring people to the world," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space theory.
At some point it becomes reality, but if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, which is a home for their offspring born in space.
