In recent days there have been all over the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will even further or whether they are out of the air again soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-governmental organisations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States sales turn the millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand mixtures.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, its work and Carnegie together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targets individuals with low and middle income.
Walm kind sold all products, nappies on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The commodity in the Walmart stores, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the paid Walmart employees buy only at the workplace.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart, one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say Walmart can sell the goods often so cheaply because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution to the company health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 a hour, could afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars a hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
There are about 1.1% more than they pay now.
Would pass on Walmart wage increases to the customers, every purchase they cost only 46 cents more in the future.
They compared to today, which would be a year for additional expenditure of only 12.39 dollars.
Advocates of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine states to protests, and brought them to the company any losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart cashier on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogel, who claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington post that "less than five" Walmart employees work, and the protest action is yet another "PR stunt," of the trade union, which organised the protests, and.
"Free money!"
The protests erupted this week in New York, where Walmart stores (which are not not in this progressive city, and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billions of chickens, and yet you are granted no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.
Juma said Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage legislation under federal and New York at $7.25 a hour.
In fast food restaurants will gradually raise the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York $8.90 a hour.
No one less than it deserves in this expensive city.
As it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time in which almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's stood behind the counter, but the young people were living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it is the main source of income or to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's always people who complain that they have with this wage and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper the Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how it is to feed.
Participants in the protests, which on Thursday at 6,30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants a minimum wage of $15 a hour, which is more than a doubling of the the current minimum wage.
They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prevents the management to stand in the way of this objective and union members to admonish or to dismiss.
On the other hand, does not make the management of them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is, but also for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
On this day, there were strident protests from many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including City Council member Juma said Williams, who said: "McDonald's said that it sell billions portions, and yet they'll be given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio candidate who said that "we should work together supporting the fast-food workers, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, deserves every New Yorker!."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But there were only a few hundred people on the ground, far from all of them are employed in the fast-food industry, in the working in New York tens of thousands of.
It is not yet clear whether the spark will mobilise whole mass protests.
