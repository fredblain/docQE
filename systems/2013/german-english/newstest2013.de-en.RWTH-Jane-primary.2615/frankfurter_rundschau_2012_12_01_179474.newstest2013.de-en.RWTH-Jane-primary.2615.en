Messenger: NASA ice discovered on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice should be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
He is closest to the sun, there are frozen water, as well as from three studies published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
The probe Messenger have found evidence that there is the region of the planet permanently in the shadow of ice.
This is supposed to be at least 30 cm and perhaps even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids that may also have taken on the Mercury.
The discovery of ice but linked to with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help clarify how have water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the world's citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, to explore the depths of the space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: small in.
The image comes from a camera, the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun beyond Neptune, is Ceres under the new definition of the International Astronomical Union 2006 is not a "planet."
This image cutting an infrared absorption of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless stars generations: the oldest stars are visible as blue dots, are harder to identify the pink "newborn" in the circle of stars.
This sternenbildende region raged - very unromantic - called by scientists has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the stars Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.

The Spitzer telescope of Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birth.
The Pleijades star clusters, including "the Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
However, the colors better with the telescope.
But Age looks like a red in this infrared picture the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a continent brought this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and spread-spectrum photo provides for spectacular colour.
This baby star could be included in its full beauty by the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how this came about, is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe they are the remains of a Saturn moon, who disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and strongest pictures of the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the color of spiral galaxies to be works of art.
The European Southern Observatory, shows the several thousand light years away Trifid fog in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three sections, dreigespalten), dreiteilen as dark dust, the fiery heart of the star's birthplace.
In our own galaxy, astronomers have photographed harbingers of a cosmic Karambolage: 400 million light years from Earth hurtling the cores of two verschmelzender galaxies collide and will inevitably collide with each other.
These stars are born of the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
As for those who are not technical abbreviations, which may call them by their nickname Southern fire.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a portion of the Iris Nebula in the star image Kepheus.
The 1400 light years distant fog consists of dust grains, the ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, the space telescope Hubble for Nasa.
Scientists call the greater spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this stars fog is the group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle will produce ever more involved.
These stars cloud, together with the Rosetten fog, brings new baby stars - 5000 light years from Earth.
In this light bright galaxy with a small black hole is not, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was born just after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope will have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperfeld Hey - even before it began a year later to the stars Galileo Galilei observation.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes ever greater, and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, in this image, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
You can gaze into space on two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma Telescopio is huge - the mirror is at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope is segmented in South Africa - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of eleven metres.
As part of the design: the telescope is in his elevation angle - and thus limited in his mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is - despite comparatively low mirror diameter - the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers told the space for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) every computer owner can help by putting computing power.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in Chile's Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - makes his name.
With its four mirrors in the telescope can also the infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory is the planned European Extremely Large Telescope.
Its main mirror is to include 42 meters - and nearly 1000 mirrors elements.
But with images can be expected until 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten metres.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which provides them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on the summit of Mauna Kea is to create a new, huge telescope with a mirror average of thirty metres.
It is here on an illustration.
But the main impressions from space provides the space telescope Hubble.
Since the April 24, 1990, already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets - especially for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, was commissioned by the Nasa announced that identified 1235 planet candidates since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture are documented the final launch preparations at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be taken until at least 2018 on board an Ariane5 spacecraft.
The primary mirror of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that the Mercury also at the South Pole ice.
However, there are no reliable data, since the Messenger far closer to the North Pole to the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have pointed out that there are on the ice.
The Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first revolves around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
