"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
And civil rights activist, about the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals with fake certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to make money for the upkeep of the remaining families home.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which every migrant a test, the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing services and retail.
But the tests are to be transformed over time, according to migration authority for all migrant workers in the future.
It must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language proficiency must be proved for and the the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian official language.
Also are exempt from this law, people who have received their training certificates and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, and protection of the rights issue
The whole of the inspection bodies is under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of the People, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants would be able to take the tests in all cities, have already been opened in Russia more than 160 such centres.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal immigration authority.
Human rights activists, however, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press the following question: What does it?
What changes does the legislation required to have language skills, both for the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, to say the migration authority spokesman, is to reduce the number of forced labour.
"A lot of talk now about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
But their rights must be protected even before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment to 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.
Run into problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that will face a future without knowledge of the language is necessarily bad people who, under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he stayed with dozens of months without food and documents and will work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home is promised you one thing, and on arrival you cheated to, their passports and do not receive the promised wage" the head of the main administration labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not having a go, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, that they do not only the language of the country, but also to express themselves in their own language, in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a sound basic education.
Because their families are not even money to feed the children, let alone them decent clothes, shoes and buy school clothes.
These children then immediately as a teenager take the first opportunity for making money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they give.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Human rights activists say regarding the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, there is no investigation and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Entry for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, the of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for a year and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that most of our documents and we are not registered, and this gives rise to cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers"
Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only can be falsified registration documents of migrants.
Some counterfeit certificates that the completion of the language tests, were beschlaggenommen by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer.
This, of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant three thousand rubles.
That is the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that we can't buy the certificates are simple, both officials and civil rights activist.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers who fall for the first time the test, only promise that they have time for a course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered in areas where there is no active communication with people.
