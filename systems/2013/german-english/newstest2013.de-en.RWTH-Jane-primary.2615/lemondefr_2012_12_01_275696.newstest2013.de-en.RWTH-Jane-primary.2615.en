With Bitcoin is and selling without bank possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, unidentified transactions and administrative fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often happens in these technologies is a political vision: the belief that the current bank monopolies designed monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, is that Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollar, euro convertible, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network has already covered some 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand websites Bitcoin accept a donation or payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to 2 dollars, before he has now recovered to around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly low prices compared to the world trade currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest.
Bitcoin describes as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that will be used to move forward in a video game, win or kupiÄ‡ through games (and sometimes) can.
The social networking site Facebook has developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin all network node of the accounting book depository, auditors at the same time, money, issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose for each payment to a different address, ensuring the anonymity.
A number of data relating to this transaction will be signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the accounting book of the entire network of public accounts.
The crucial step is to sign this new transaction in this book.
This is a mathematical task, which will be run on computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line.
It is a carving up the file, the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.
The computer ,"" the new transaction and add a number, before the whole thing "a."
The aim is to find the one number that a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found that can examine the other nodes, whether it is the right one.
The transaction is continuously linked with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If an user to pay for cheating twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money would only be validated by the network and the other remains one of the two transactions without linkage, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, leaving a margin...
It also increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The weakness is not the actual protocol," Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, a company to pay real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering by means of this anonymous service.
But also cash these shortcomings.
Important players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blog platform WordPress, they will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the accounting book shows and that almost 80% of the Bitcoins in circulation.
A "mega sale" was launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company's Bitcoins Coin Abul, converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin validation of the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner's identity and therefore can remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented with the, and they do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
They simply need to an address, photographed and identified by a telephone "can be," Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to be reconsidered in the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time to prevail Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, the, the different, highly regarded today than to assess risks in the event of a success of this currency.
