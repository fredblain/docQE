The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future Constitution of sharia as the basis is controversial.
Egyptian President not sparing with pathos.
We need to make the switch.
"And that he will succeed, is my responsibility to the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all, the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because all of them, has been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of theocracy in the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He has said almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily and expanded its competences, "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles, the 100 -member Constituent Assembly dominated by the Islamist in a night, were pushed through 15 -hour two-volume set, worrying.
As in past constitutions, the draft, the case law based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague wording and the attendant legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least a new hinzugeführter Article: in all matters concerning the Sharia influences must be considered university, the country's main Islamic institution with great power throughout the of the Sunni Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that oversees the clergy the legislation, which would de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Many in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule to the repression of political opponents.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The state should also, as stated in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" to "protect and promote its morals and values."
Legally speaking, is so vague that could control state institutions with the help of this article even the content of film art and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly stipulates equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to offend or slander.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Just as questionable is the phrase that "insulting people" should be banned.
There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a Leader?
Interpretation, like so many in the draft, which Morsi to sign before and after words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
For weeks, the opposition against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the Charter, before they can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter MB) of the presidential elections.
, Nobel Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei, one of the draft Constitution "on the scrapheap of history."
Via text messaging service Twitter, he accused supporters of Morsi's, a "coup against democracy."
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said the opposition Yasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Ali in doing so.
And several judges announced that they would not supervise the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, as a precaution, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer from Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafi called, and said: "the people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "Säubere The country!" Protested and said: "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for control of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything, would have created civil.
The clearly wanted to the risk of Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood, both supporters and opponents of the draft would have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists is safe.
"The word" human rights is not even "
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were in prison or under Mubarak stood in court.
Because he would not share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now is not the word" human rights in the new constitution, "he said in an interview with the" Welt am Sonntag. "
Morsi extension to all three branches of power in the state's lawyer did resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Rather than strengthening civil society, the President of the, Saeda de facto suspended."
But without civil society organisations could not function in a democracy.
Saeda alone feels abandoned by the international community, which considers the ideological direction of the fight on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
A protester in Tahrir warns: "You gebährt not a monster, the more You can control."
