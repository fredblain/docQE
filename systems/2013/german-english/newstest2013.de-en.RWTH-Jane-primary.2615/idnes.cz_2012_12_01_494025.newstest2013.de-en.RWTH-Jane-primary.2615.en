Poland and the space.
Poland was admitted last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member States of the European space Agency (ESA) as a member of this space easy authority. Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which took place on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994 and participated in a close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA projects in the next several years.
The path of Poland into space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War II Polish space enthusiasts with the space, and they were not always understanding.
I remember of the lecture by A. ternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, which the author thought from his pioneering work "entrance to the cosmonautics."
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) but the audience cold, and after years ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had only shown interest in his work.
Ternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the cosmonautics" by Robert Esnault Pelttari and André Louis Hirsch, Prix REPS Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been acknowledged by, among other things, that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925 was built in Poland a railway trolley, which was planned for a rocket engine.
The author of the draft, and the details of this project have unfortunately been unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or the brakes of the trolley.
The information can come only from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen purpose-as began.
The research, the Institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents show that the research was down to the stage of practical tests.
But the research was then interrupted by the invading German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the press of. Rohoziski originating draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, he joined the "raki 生Eta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealing with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology from passing scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of work has been finished his work by the beginning of the war.
Another article on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major articles of the space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to a space company.
At the time there was the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that would have the space exploration future.
Even at its inception in 1956, the Polish space Society PTA membership based on the 1951 International Federation for space, and indeed, the PTA in autumn 1956 member.
The following year was the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy chairman of the International Federation for space.
This post he held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA took part in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (raki Eta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, 1, was completed in 1957, the first race took place on 10 October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was 80 cm long and weighed just 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the brillantes 1 A, built, and 1959 in the Bledowska Desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket más brillantes 2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should be able to make real scientific work - the rocket más brillantes 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, but, has been halted further development.
Successor to the first missiles of the type RM was developed in the years 1962 to 1965 Meteor- 1 rocket.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length of 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
From this developed three types (Meteor- 1 A, 1 B and - 1 C), which manifested in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor- 1 a rocket had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor- 1 B 0.34 litre and Meteor- 1 C for 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 was developed in the aviation institute which Meteor- 2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor- 2 has a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km.
After the versions were built Meteor- 2 H and Meteor- 3.
Also worth mentioning is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in space research with Soviet satellite, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Hermaszewski current legislation after the Czechs second interwetten cosmonaut Vladimir Remek.
