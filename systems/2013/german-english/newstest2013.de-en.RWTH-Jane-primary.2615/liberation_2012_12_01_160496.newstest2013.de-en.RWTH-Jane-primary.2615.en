French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are likely to be at the end of 2014.

The young people have of the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran and Pakistan have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
The state schools in the cities are full of boys and girls.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the parties to the corruption of certain executives, will have to make jobs available.
