In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in southeast Colorado for a crime to justice, which will be in this country legally soon: the possession of a few of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
The said that he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was cited for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - excusable peccadilloes that are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and has a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," he said.
But he is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of minor drug offenses, less by the law, as the location.
Hundreds of the offences that revolve around marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, already approved similar measures, dropped.
The police authorities are adults over 21 years longer for possession on a small scale. This is allowed by law, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced that existing marijuana offenses, and people are still quoting in court.
At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains on new to prevent state licensed marijuana shops in the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. resigned, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington State loss scratch on the head.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that in any case, most states Colorado, with regard to the regulation of marijuana was only legalized the drug for medical purposes and then for private consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state lends itself so well to," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, known as I- 502, enters into force on 6 December and at the end of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not exist yet, but it is legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practice questions need to be addressed in this time around, as the government's target of a "fair access" to lizenziertem marijuana beeps with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds should be agreed and childcare facilities.
"It will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal cannabis," a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, sent his staff in Aurora Chief resigned in an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would not pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years, and that the police "will not seek prosecutions for such offences.
The police chief resigned added that will continue to enforce the rules regulating growers of medical marijuana and urban targets would continue to pursue drug traffickers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado County prosecutor Ken Buck represents a harsher view.
After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdrawal.
To date, 119 people have been charged for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have been charged for other offenses.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute offences, to the point of the," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are themselves in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, does not adults for the possession of small quantities for longer.
District prosecutor Pete Hautz Rei√üinger supported this decision, but decided not to drop all outstanding possession proceedings.
"I do not think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it is changing," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the outset that it would not be easy, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
Among local officials, and the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.
In county prosecutors if it were a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for marijuana offenses the in court, and local acts as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for it, that they cannot accept the legalization still," he believes.
As the first states to deal with the small quantities of marijuana like alcohol, traded Colorado and Washington as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
For the legalization movement hope that will give the Ministry of Justice.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states large part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama administration believes that no doors are likely to law enforcement officials to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but probably will resist, under the new legislation to allow legal, state-regulated marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado not wait to see the federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local administrations moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although it could open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
"We would not be to get someone in a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
Our community has voted against the legislation.
We have done this for what it has not the government and then, for what was decided by the state.
There are still many questions unanswered.
