A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the latter is the Brennan Center is a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The attorneys for the Republicans have seen in 10 years in the U.S. only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the democratic system the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the United states for the conduct of the elections in the various states.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, has announced new laws that the process for registering or the ballot.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections on November 2010, which resulted in 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also will be shortened the time periods for the early vote, declared the law invalid, to register as voters on election day and citizens the right to vote, for which there is a legal acts.
Before the elections of 2006, no U.S. state has asked the voters to show photo identification.
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
The United States Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend it to other states.
Over the last two years, in 34 states draft laws, which forced the voters to show photo identification.
It is important to note that the U.S. citizens do not unlike Quebec on an universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million vocal people no photo identification issued by a governmental authority of their state.
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary documents.
The new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years on the required photo ID.
This goes further.
The students who are seen as voters casting their votes for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo ID issued by the establishment.
On the other hand, allow the same States members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state has called for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, who introduced such a request.
Since 2011 a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
Clearly these measures are designed to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states have laws, doing away with the registration of voters on election day.
You have also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to voter registration in the 2004 general election to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006% by 17.
The Republican legislators in five other states have also adopted laws that aim to shorten the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida was 33% of the voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though they represent only 13% of voters in the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the White, which represented 76% of the voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the controversial legislation.
They could limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have laws that require the of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012, the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the 2012 key states.
A report by the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws, which make up 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the democratic system the United States.
