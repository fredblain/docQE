In an ever elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving unexpectedly I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another plane.
I had enough time to make a few thoughts on boredom.
I am not going to.
A waiting half a day at the airport on a flight that is pretty annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, steuerfreies shopping) are available.
But a growing number of academics and child development experts boredom as something positive.
So far as they are concerned, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.
So that the brain is forced to get caught up in interesting thoughts, which promotes the creativity.
And since rigid nowadays most of us almost constantly on the one or other screen, the benefits of boredom.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Bore Cathedral: A Lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
"Indeed, the boredom of a very long history," he says.
The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, going back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that in many ways been defined and discussed is boredom.
Professor Eastwood and his colleagues after a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people came to the conclusion that boredom than the experience, "to be able to do a satisfactory job, but it is not define."
Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, in such a way that is not the person, but I want to be.
In the apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "the process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can almost hear as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although they could be two things, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have just difficult to concentrate.
In their study, "the Unengaged mind: Defi Ning Bore Cathedral in terms of attention" - to: "the idle mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science "was, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, the participants listened to a tape in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television, said to have more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for it and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you put a monotonous work, "as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, can distract music and help to not feel bored."
Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may even combat this by physical persons remain attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who must learn herumhampeln, more and more information than those who are forced to remain seated," says Professor Fenske.
All of us will ever be boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly tedious film.
But some people bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980 s on a "scale of boredom vulnerability."
On the scale found statements such as "there are a lot of things that I have to do, and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
Researchers have found that boys with of such abradability more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially, with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter clusters.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and doing the homework bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said to feel bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he does not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
But he was sure that "youth is seen as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily routines.
So back to my original question: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it leads people to extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to alleviate it, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is a professor Vodanovich, who researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom of the brain to say that we should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what to do it best.
If a boring and energy to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy.
But television can provide for happiness in the short term, but these evaporate in the long term.
So who is his bored child an iPad, it can distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske..
And he adds: "self-regulation is transferred from one situation to another."
Not only the child learns to talk, but also in other areas more self-control.
I do not believe that we should celebrate.
We should do not see it too critical.
Instead, our objective should be to feel at of permanent Aktivitäts and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds so we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are looking for a way to switch off and relax in truth only.
"In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is hard to address, if the noise."
