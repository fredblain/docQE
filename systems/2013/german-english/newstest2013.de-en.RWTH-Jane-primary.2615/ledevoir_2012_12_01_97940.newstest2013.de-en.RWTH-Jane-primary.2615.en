Palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on "death with dignity" Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there remains to be done in this important area.
Financing academic has tried to look as this.
A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, it aufzehrte, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me to live five years, I have managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, in his bed at home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Belo pursuit, in which he arrived the previous the day.
"It is always a shock, however, it is not to be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from going to the toilet and even to eat.
On the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned, agrees to help.
He even manages to smile bravely and speak with strangers who are around him, give him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary people.
"My greatest wish is that my cures diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease.
"During our lifetime we learn that loves a man standing," says Pierre Brod, psychologist Victor Gadbois at home.
In return, the childhood phase for some people is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept a retrograde step, he says.
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, big events in the midst of setbacks.
The patients who are admitted into the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, be they from the doctors and nurses who care for them, not inundated with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89, is the worst fear, "and" to die by suffocation.
But the disease I learned my children really know.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no wishes to be in life," she says, before accepting that it set up a mask that helps her breathe.
They expected in the next few days, a recent visit by her son, who is from Italy.
Based on Victor Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in the food.
The palliative care is used if there are no other options.
In order to make the deaths.
In Quebec, with 11,700 inhabitants a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little, given that we will all die one day.
It is simply a continuation of the life in the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
It provides for the dying, according to a with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we served a beer Mr X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
Based on Victor Gadbois is different every day.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, the last family gathering in the courtyard and is supported well by his pillow, while opening up to his honor, a young man of 36 years dies, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, tragically, having tried everything in order to survive.
"For six months are three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel worries.
53% of the pet Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is, to a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in a hospital or a nursing home.
And several organisations, such as the pet Victor Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is this major shortcomings in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of of a law on euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto, signed by prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec the health system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, has taken measures to alleviate.
I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
The, while several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions fought until the last day.
The survival of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has broken off a difficult chemotherapy.
As I told my oncologist that I will drop out of the treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told.
However, she said to me that I was at the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said clearly that is not the Continuum palliative care for pain treatment.
After a young man Monereau, director of the palliative care of society is not talking of domestic palliative care of Greater Montreal 8% of patients in pain treatment.
At the very end of life so doctors often back to the C-terminal sedation, which seeks to lull the patients either permanently or intermittently until the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not see this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to use this C-terminal sedation.
Patients, not to alleviate their pain, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want to put me," but "I would like to see reduced my pain."
The implementation of this report was possible on the basis of a journalism scholarship Canadian health research institutes.
