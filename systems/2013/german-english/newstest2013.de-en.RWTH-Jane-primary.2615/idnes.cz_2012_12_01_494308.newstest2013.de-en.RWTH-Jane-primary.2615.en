Israel: laboratory of chaos.
..." that there is nothing that could arise from violence or Sting sings in the song" fragile, the most ever chorus: ..." so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons were no wars, there would be no," says the dying Gutele continuity Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions.
The there are those who stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, to argue with the racism of the State of Israel, with to the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and the State of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point I don't to write about who is in these recurring waves of killing someone who is guilty and who ultimately victims; the today's inhabitants of Israel including the self-rule territories in the current political situation, and have not seen the start of the violence.
My concern is to give readers a look behind the scenes, look who's 95 years of tension (from Balfour declaration in November 1917) in the small parcels of land in the Middle East in particular.
My thoughts are based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding of who or what group of people affected by the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can see an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether they really were always those people themselves, of their autonomy, or whether someone was behind her throne, who drew their actions on a vorbestimmtes goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power within the life span of a generation.
Under these astronomical is a particularly rich families, which could be described as head of the octopus (I do not know if there is someone above them, but I do not rule out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
It is understandable.
The first (Reuters press agency) was of the Rothschilds already in the 90 s of the 19th century, bought in order to prevent the linking its name with hochkriminellen deeds, in the context of the consolidation of its power, the propagation of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip themselves to this (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, but in the meantime, the central Bank of Russia's government has).
Anyone who has ever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds as central Bank, Bank of America during the civil war began to issue their own (read: official) notes and was murdered in 1865 in a theatre.
J.f. Kennedy, began to issue their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve - he was assassinated in 1963; Mr Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned 1936, after the Fed wanted to sue for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds, in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to free up three world wars by Albert Masonic spades, an of the 33th and the highest degree of recognition.
The first war aimed to eliminate the big royalist states, Europe should be broken by the second war, in particular Britain's colonial rule, and the third war to reduce the world's population to around 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and luxury and would not use so many resources), create an universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the head, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (or from chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve, so that crises like the one of them in 1907 triggered repeat).
After it was managed by the murder of the Hapsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering World War I, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar's empire the war was not necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria.
In order to be able to the Second World war, the bankers by the policy could create a latent conflict situation by Germany with huge war reparations, which they created the condition of impoverished masses, so they had to only palming the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who named the guilty, and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should be the function of a fifth column, and also played in order to the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in a branch of the establishment of a Jewish state, as turned on the historic area with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were the first clashes with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second world War broke out, and whether Hitler, ran aground off the chain, which it initially had kept the international bankers, or whether everything has gone according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any event, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, was to the, as well as by the war reparations from Germany for the Second World war, the creation of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the third World war.
If we will be in the international bankers to unleash this war, the Jewish people victims of the Second World war II in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply divided the people of Israel's supporters and opponents).
Who is the guilty party and who the victims in the conflict between Palestinians and Vojeans Israelites, where it is wrong in an endless cycle of violence, which was at the beginning of the greed and their quest for global power?
We must differentiate between the people of Israel and its leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, the hawk, is a typical example of a faschismusanf√§lligen, international bankers loyal devoted politician who does everything to spark a war with Iran, which, in the of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict, and because of the Iran's control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, could lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of the words of David Rockefellers in 1994: "the only thing we need is an across-the-board crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In its presentation of the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted in the birth of a chip to submit this system of total control.
"And it is that the kids and the Great, the rich and the poor, the Free and the servants of a malt oak give their right hand or in their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he was because, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, who has, consider the number of the animal.
Because it is a human figure, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig. "
