"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season with PSG have adopted a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I am on their side.
The technical staff has given me a lot.
These factors spurring me on a daily basis to improve my game.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football everything is going very quickly.
But I must stop in enthusiasm.
Since my early days at the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my time in St Etienne I have always made gradual progress.
They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer the newcomers are used to host games very high levels.
They also know that every training session.
This means that a player like me, and wants to give his best.
Incidentally, it gives me a lot in terms of my game Carlo.Its Ancelotti.
It is supported by other coaches as Claude blemish, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti breathes all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there are currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had a good conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust that he has put in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the top.
But we are in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified in this way for the World Cup.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as much as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First, we want to be the first of our group in Porto, so that we can deal with the return leg of the eighth and final home game.
The PSG can be a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a major European club, to win Paris title and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
The PSG financial resources, so that this project is the concrete forms.
It would be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really important for us to cream off the title.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to secure the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
You should normally be champion with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I believe that this is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux fight for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been done and the players that we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
If we win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and it is still something that cannot be accused, this is a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
You look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, to qualify for the eighth final, and also has made huge spending.
With regard to the amounts invested you believed to break with 15 points ahead of the.
This would mean that would let our opponents and the French Cup.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not in the last season, this new PSG "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May by the smiling winner and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and scores many goals.
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has had in mind that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Taina Silva, who is one of the best defenders, allowing the rest to make progress.
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I was anxious to take part in this championships.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from glean some game time.
I have seen things, which I am emerged strengthened.
Today, I will be able to make good games in the national team.
This was my hope for my baptism with the "Bleus."
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must show an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strictly, the players and encourages the to victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved its goal, he had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps "Bleus" will lead to Brazil.
Is that on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1:1) an opening the game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
Before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
