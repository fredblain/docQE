The most difficult job in the world: the human working animals from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they 70 kilos of sulfur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by recruiting them sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day he has to get down on the floor of the crater, where solidified itself out of the earth, sulphurous gas in contact with the air.
He has extracted large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, with the balance and must put their steps carefully so that they do not slip and fall.
You know that each step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which reduce them.
Once at the top, they pave the path between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company has set up a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candiolo Ngrimbi that since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (never better) exploiting its workers, which they said 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) is charged for every kilogram of sulphur.
They then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life and for the production of wood, fireworks, cosmetics, used dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar.
"Because we usually have 70 kg, for each way we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," said us Anto, which normally makes three trips a day.
He needed three hours for each track that he is fatigued, he has at the end of the day, but then 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The days of the mine workers" wages here, where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be paid on the day and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167 euros), is very high, "said the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near returned, and for a reason, which is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty breathing, coughs and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto puts his life at the Kawah Ijen for three years, which has already left the first traces of him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty breathing, coughs and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here two years because I open a shop or want to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent young man, but life overregulated could work as tourist guides, waiters or on at the of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a stretcher.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other sources and, at two o'clock every morning, because you feel the sulphur at night, where his distinctive yellow colour in the darkness of.
The shadow challenging, he is in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet, which he bought his own money into the crater.
About 400 bearers load on the crater floor baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their large profits, the mining company mechanised the sulphur reduction in order to save costs, and provides the tools that work on their own account and are paid according to weight, no equipment.
You also get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) fee per camera, the guardians of this natural parks, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) require the tourists who come to the shooting of the volcano and the human Tragesel.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protested Madrusin, a sturdy, 42-year-old economist who works three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, "as long as it is," because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18.
I will do not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur throat burns and when the wind suddenly and einklemmt mine workers in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains about serious diseases..., of course, the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in in addition to the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which have distorted by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back with his 53 years Drennik Unai is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, which are carried by three trucks on a goat path between the to camp in Taman Austurdalur in 18 kilometres away.
"I will do not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my life," said that he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
The of his five children is with his 30 years as sulphur.
As time passes, but the poverty LÃ¶rke generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: the people who work as human load donkey on Kawah Ijen.
