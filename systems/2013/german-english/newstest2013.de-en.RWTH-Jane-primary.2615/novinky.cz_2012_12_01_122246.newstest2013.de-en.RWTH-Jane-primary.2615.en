Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, an annual survey on the oddest bank charges, has decided to this year, the most absurd thing regulation or idea from the EU "workshop."
"This idea brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of the poll, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are for the insurance companies objectively less risk.
"Another incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory blending of bioethanol to petrol, which is in its wake naturschädigend, the ban on the mercury thermometer, just because they include a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on size of chicken cages, because of the eggs this year were much more expensive.
Criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even a ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas are 14 cm long
The EU machine often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in Brussels in the rule of one or more Member States (the Czech Republic, for example, is trying to push through the demands of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas must be the highest in the EU trade class at least 14 cm long and no "curvature anomaly."
The European Commission defended with the argument that they harmonisiere only the fragmented national standards that would impede trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries already have been undermined by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons in the sale by saying that children under eight years not inflate the balloon without supervision of an adult.
The EU, citing an American study, which in accordance with balloons are the leading cause of death of children.
A similar restriction applies for children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious ideas at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive, which concerns the European officials - anyone who has an official function in the EU, must not because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead use the name Macedonia, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovní poplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU, so that the maximum volume of food supplies, which could be on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic crossed then set for canned mushrooms, which we threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them, that they have no sea, or from the idea to give grants for applications for funding.
These ideas but did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will be asking for a refund from the EU, "said in the autumn of 2004, the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (SSD).
The argument put forward is that the grain harvest is very high, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded government camps.
The Czech Republic to sea ports have another way, the EU should according to Palas paying hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission, the Czech Republic so far that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered communities the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US DEU), specifically, it has to be funds for the establishment of aid money requests to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the Member States easy target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, hence, efficiency and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition.
A serious problem, according to these experts are more the EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but they were in the budget negotiations by individual Member States.
Emotions here also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic must fight like other member countries in Brussels about the right to use specific names of traditional products and don't win this fight it.
The Czech Republic was able to do so after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, but had to our manufacturers in Germany, "Tuzemák."
The designation "rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distil, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU are appearing in the company of the world-famous feta cheese, gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, carp from Pohoelice and now Karlovy Vary, or even the Žatec hops.
With an EU trademark can boast the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hoicer roles.
