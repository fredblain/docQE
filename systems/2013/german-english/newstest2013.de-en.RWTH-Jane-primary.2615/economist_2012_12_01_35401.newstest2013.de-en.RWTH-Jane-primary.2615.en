Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
There can be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the bud.
Amid the usual recriminations countless buildings in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed and six Israelis - and, for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that could find the deadly standoff finally end.
A war that neither will be won or lost
At first glance seems appropriate given the current situation is optimistic.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, have strengthened the this week's fighting hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis, although his group even suffered heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and packed the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet, Israel has failed so far to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has to hold powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once known as well as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah power over Syria, where rebels could be an increasingly islamistischeren character before the Stürzung Bashar Assad, to to Jordan, where Hamas is threatening allies of the king.
And, in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the most densely populated and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 2011 30 years until his overthrow, had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood is out with Hamas and its leaders more popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove Hamas as a player that can't be squeezed out of Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, however, to draw the opposite conclusion.
Military terms, however, that Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep peacefully.
In diplomatic terms, the United States has been steadfast in their position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the industry, which hineinverlaufen in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared for international law, however, be.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud Party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren group.
Why is this cunning Palestinians cuddled and handed them their own state?
If they had, the control of the West Bank, just like their in Gaza, then it would not fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and to punish, should they dare to raise their heads.
It may be able to the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could make them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will focus initially on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which is undoubtedly will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, exploded as a bus in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only worsen the situation.
Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand over the years increasing its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outside
The answer is that the the more reasonable members of both parties, which most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states, which Israel is stepping down for security purposes.
The - in the near future small - hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.
Together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt must now stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and Hamas is better positioned than ever to the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of 1967 borders, with land swaps, and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state, with the forthcoming request for U.N. observer status.
Obama must do its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also participating.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
