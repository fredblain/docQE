Proving MVRDV architects that is not only the real adventure in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books mountain - 2 photos
"I think the building, it looks futuristic, and finally it is to see something interesting," said Lisette, Aig, a roadside Passantin.
And Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby big business, says: "But, it is beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is voluntarily today in one of these Old Style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige sleeping city on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The of 80,000 inhabitants, the lowest rate throughout the Netherlands.
To counter this stupid thing, it was decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general education and the seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro notes, as emulate nicely bepinselte concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to deal with the Mehmed-pasha Mr: a library needs.
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of tollkühnen beam charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared for the hearing on competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury is still out looked nonplussed, and jerked nonchalantly esspecially the cheeky Maas exquisite souvenirs of the size of a pyramid and ended his speech aktionistisch reinforced with the words: "Love municipality!"
It is, therefore, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the of EUR 30 million.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also underground car park, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the books with the second prize awarded "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is not the faceless small-town retort, which until now had to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind the of white façades inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all Spijkenisse, on the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The long road to book
The first impression: books El Dorado under glass.
There is a lift which leads halfway through the hills, but the real space and reading tap the fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The Sonnenalm glazed interior is bright and clear, the soil and the elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for parking Bank, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and a big, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have made the classic room configuration on the head and put the reading area from inside out.
The interior of the books ," is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, Schachclub, environmental centre and Haustechnikzentrale.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which, are the.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and engineers shake whether use of the unknown.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trou Borst, project manager for the city of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we came up one day in a friesländischen agricultural business on a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes plastic fleece as root.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two, then it is ready for the rubbish bins.
For the library was the fleece - for the first time in this volume - forced to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that smells a little for new cars and a little after athletic footwear.
After 105 stages has reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long travels in literature café is not only a fantastic prospect of the city, but also rewarded with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in literature.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trou Borst.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the books mountain under a glass fall, the sun is shining even on sunny days only briefly to the interior.
The wide, which is right across the glass façade, serve as shading and much of the sun.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest do fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Even Lisette, Aig was already there.
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even as Spijkenisses "long-overdue soul."
The reason: In the opening of a few weeks ago, everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal collection.
It is not yet again the optical gaps in the fully stocked library - currently 70,000 - will be filled.
The idea has taken root.
The shelves are filled absolutely fed up.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think everyone now thanks to our invitation, has residents of a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
And if it is just an ornament.
This is the King discipline that MVRDV called in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
So young and uneducated they may be.
Finally, this is a starting point for identity.
