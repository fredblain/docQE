<h1>
<seg id="1">A republican strategy, in order to oppose the re-election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The managers of the republicans justify their politics with the necessity to oppose the choice fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Brennan Center holds latter for a myth when confirms that the choice fraud is rarer in the USA than the number of the people killed from the flash of lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lawyers of the republicans recorded only 300 cases of choice fraud after all the way in 10 years in the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One is secure: these new regulations will affect the poll negatively.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense these measures untergraben in part the democratic system of the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada the US Federal states are responsible for the realization of the choices in the single states.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this sense the majority of the American governments since 2009 announced new laws which complicate the procedure for the registration or the urn walk.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon gained importance after the choices of November 2010, at which 675 new republican representatives in 26 states could be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Due to that 180 drafts alone in the year 2011 were introduced which restrict the practice of the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new choice laws require that the voters present a photograph identity card and a proof of the US citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition also the periods are reduced through these laws for the early voice delivery, declared the right to register on the choice day as voters for invalid, and arranged citizens for whom there is a court file the right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the choices of 2006 no US state demanded from the voters to show a photograph identity card.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first Federal state to raise such a demand.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Uppermost court of justice of the United States confirmed the constitution moderateness of the law of Indiana in the year 2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice onto other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the course of the last two years they supported in 34 Federal states drafts with which the voters are forced to show a photograph identity card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is to be said importantly that the US citizens do not have a universal ID card as the health insurance card unlike Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact 11% of the US citizens, that is 21 million elective persons do not have any photograph identity card exhibited by a government authority of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition five million new voters do not have in the year 2012 such an identity card.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, more than a hundred dollars are to be paid frequent in order to receive the necessary identity card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">From the new restrictions young people, minorities and people are disproportionately strongly affected with low income.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact 25% of the afro-Americans, 15% of the persons with an income of less than $35.000, 18% of the citizens do not have the necessary photograph identity card over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This suffices still further.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is not allowed in several states to the students that are regarded as voters that give their voice increased for democratic candidates to use their photograph identity card exhibited by their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand the same states allow members of fishing rod or hunt associations which choose more strongly for the republican page to use the cards made out by these associations for choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004 no Federal state demanded a proof of the citizenship for the dialing.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first Federal state to introduce such a demand.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011 a dozen of states have passed laws which require of the voters that they prove their US citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are aimed clearly at restricting the hispanischen voices.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because it is obvious, that two of three hispanischen voters that prefer democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition republican legislators supported in 2011 in eight Federal states laws with which the registration was abolished by voters on choice day.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition you restricted the right to achieve those voters support from individuals and groups that would like to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example the campaigns helped for the voter registration with the case of the general elections in 2004 to register approx. 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">Because through those for 2009 adopted measures the part of the registration was reduced from new voters by 17% in 2010 in comparison with 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition the republican legislators passed in five more Federal states laws which are aimed at reducing the period for the early voice delivery.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example 33% of the voters who chose in advance, Afro-Amerikaner, were with the case of the general elections 2008 in Florida although they form only 13% of the voters of the Federal state.</seg>
<seg id="39">Same one is valid for the hispanische population.</seg>
<seg id="40">Latter formed only 11% of the voters, however 24% of the citizens that chose in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast formed the white, that represented 76% of the voters, only 46% of the voters, that chose in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters opposed vigorously to the discharge of laws that restricts the registration of the voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several drafts were blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The general attorney of the USA intervened in order to misfire the most controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">You could restrict the damages in part.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example only 16 of the 34 Federal states passed laws which require the showing of a photograph identity card.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the again introduced rules will complicate in the year 2012 the practice of the right to vote beyond doubt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see the influencing of the results as a clear objective in them in the states decisive for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Brennan Centers by 2011 shows that the states that passed these laws form in 171 of the 270 voices that are necessary in the choice man committee in order to gain the premiership.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early in order to confirm with certainty that these changes of the right rules will have considerable effects on the result of the premiership choices at the choice system in the year 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">However one is secure: these new regulations will affect the poll negatively.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense these measures untergraben in part the democratic system of the USA.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Prostate gland cancer early recognition: the test should be done or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The PSA test shows in fact sometimes faulty results, with wrong negative or, however, also wrong positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">This leads to stronger hesitation of the already irresolute men for the realization from early recognition tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">The test should be done or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We obtained the opinion from two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the case of the studies carried out in the USA numerous disturbances existed between the control groups so that it is difficult to interpret these data and to give unequivocal recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">A further study, this time from Europe, came for the conclusion, that a difference with the case of the mortality of patients with and without early recognition exists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study also showed, that at a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years the probability of the education of metastases about 30 to 40% higher is, if no early recognition was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore I recommend the test from an age of 50 years and/or 40 years if one has a direct relative who already had fallen with prostate gland cancer ill.</seg>
<seg id="10">With men of afro-American origin also a higher risk exists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The most important thing is to make the correct decision as soon as a cancer illness was recognized.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are cancer kinds, that aggressive and others that are indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The extent of the risk of his cancer illness must be made really understandable to the patient when the possible options with the case of which Prostatakrebse can remain untreated are shown him if it does not influence the living quality in the long term, and one rather decides for an active supervision of the illness in these cases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today no treatment occurs with many men with whom one recognized cancer since their cancer is not aggressive and does not represent any threat for their life.</seg>
<seg id="15">One suggests an active supervision to them and offers them a treatment in the case of advance of the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One determines the criteria for a decision with increasing accuracy, who should be treated and who not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore I recommend the realization of the test in spite of that.</seg>
<seg id="18">It, however, is most important to speak with his doctor in order to determine whether it should be carried out or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember developed an instrument with which it is possible that before- and to evaluate disadvantages of the PSA test.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document (currently only in English, however a translation will be shortly available) can download under following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Bend forward the illness</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately there is not any miracle means for the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In spite of the progress in the research the assumption of a healthy way of life remains the best way in order to reduce the risk at it fall ill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is reckoned that 30% of the cancer illnesses could be prevented if they all ate well and moved sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If there were not any smokers anymore, this value would go up at least onto 50%", stresses André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, people go out from that that about 10% of the cancer illnesses through inheritance are caused.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several remain also completely unclear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian cancer society the fight remains a priority against the tobacco dependence, in spite of the drop of the number of the smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is also a factor of risk for several other cancer kinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It damages the health of the people strongly.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today still there are in Quebec 1.5 Mio. of smokers, the speaker André Beaulieu feels sorry.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging data: 10 years according to the renunciation of the cigarette, the risk is reduced at cancer to die around half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the Canadian cancer society predominance and Adipositas support also the outbreak of the illness.</seg>
<seg id="36">You seem the risk for Breast-, Transverse Colon-, Rectum-, to increase gullet, pancreas and womb cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that a regular physical activity protects against transverse colon cancer during the entire life" he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The feeding</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommends to restrict the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too great amount it increases the risk, to fall with a wrath and/or rectum cancer ill.</seg>
<seg id="41">Sausages should also be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preserving of meat through smoke-curing, drying or salt can lead to the education from carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The body cells can damage Letztere and lead it to the development from cancer", it declares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the last years several scientists examined the connection between vitamin additions and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Your investigations are currently not, however, conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">After the Canadian cancer society the studies to vitamin E are inconsistent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While a study was finding out the decrease of the risk from prostate gland cancer, another rather showed a rise.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was not shown clearly also yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In addition Mr Beaulieu shows how it is importantly to talk about his objections and his familiar preloading with his doctor.</seg>
<seg id="51">"The realization of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs boson analyzes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson aroused in the last summer a certain sensation, and this for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">One believes in fact, that this boson at nothing less than participated in the mechanism is that is responsible for the measures of all objects in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And finally it is a question of the last corpuscle whose existence was observed from the standard model - our best or "least wrong" declaration of the nature and the behavior of the matter - predictedly, but empirically not yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physicists it is not completely secure that it is really a question of the Higgs yet.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new corpuscle, and that it resembles the Higgs-boson predicted from the standard model strongly.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition this seems to be confirmed by new data which were presented in this week on a great physics-congress in Kyoto, but data are missing still in order to be completely secure about that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">We assume in spite of that deceiving oneself it being a question of the Higgs in fact since apparently only a small risk exists, and we have a look at what it is a question of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is in this world an unavoidably unavoidable law which causes that two objects cannot be available simultaneously at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not possible to offend against this rule - and you do not attempt it too strongly since you will hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Because even if the corpuscle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that also such a law applies to them: the Pauli'sche exclusion principle that says that two corpuscles cannot fill the same room at the same time, when they are in the same "quantum state", at which this "state" on the whole consists of some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of that going out the physicists split up the corpuscles in two categories one.</seg>
<seg id="13">The good citizens who are called Fermione and in a well-behaved way obey to the Pauli exclusion principle are in a corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in the other one those ones move bosons, a bad gang of anarchists to whom nothing is holy - in any case not this principle, what means that they can be in the action at the same time at the same place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosons divide according to himself the web page The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboren (that is after all the way completely amazing) in two groups on: the Mesonen, which we will not handle here and the "strength corpuscles", through which the great strengths of the nature spread and with those ones the Higgs boson would be somehow related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It must be accentuated here, however, that these bosons not all so exotic creatures are, as one could mean.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you are in the situation to read this chronicle then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "photon" which the "messenger" of the electro-magnetic strength is.</seg>
<seg id="18">If indeed a corpuscle with an electrical load speeds up or changes the direction, the electro-magnetic field "is faulty" exactly at this place, in about instance as a pebble that was flung into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">An electro-magnetic wave (Light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation and so forth) arises through this "trouble", and this wave is not anything else than a photon and thus one thing that one bosons "Carrier of the strength".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Same is valid for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must "be interrupted" so that this shows itself boson.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Higgs-field is very much more stable than the electro-magnetic field is; the exciter must achieve very high energies, a little bit comparable with a pond been cold whose surface could be zerfurcht only from a very big rock.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore a gigantic particle accelerator as the CERN is necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with an extent of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electro-magnetic field is once again helpful in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are not in fact all corpuscles and not all materials that interact with the electro-magnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, as magnets, do this, however other not - for example a leaf would never by itself keep paper to the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">And equally do not interact all corpuscles with the Higgs field: those ones who do it own a mass while the others are not owning (as after all the way the photon) any measures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For what can all these investigations be now "good", asks Ms Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">They serve the inspection of the standard model (SM) for the science, and they also make for the physicists possible, all deviations between the observations and the forecasts of the to examine SM exactly.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are after all the way numerous physicists who hope most ardently for such deviations being found since the least difference could open a door for a "new physics" and darn some holes of the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">One must say that latter still shows great shortcomings there it no declaration for the force of gravity (ups!) and the dark matter offers that forms approx. 80% of the matter of the universe (once again ups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">However, such deviations were not found at the CERN until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Effects</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The effects of these investigations for the general population are to be predicted in a more difficult way, but it would be to be accepted wrongly that there were not any.</seg>
<seg id="35">After all the way: in the early sixties the engineers of the laser did not presume that their works would activate such a revolution in the barking-labs.</seg>
<seg id="36">You saw scientific applications, however nothing else wider.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact the late physicist Willard Boyle - that worked in the Bell Labs in whom the laser was invented in the 1960th years, and developed that one the first continuous wave laser (the first were pulsated) in 1962 even - said already to us that the laser at the beginning was rather regarded as a "lab game".</seg>
<seg id="38">Introduce yourself...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition applications can result also from all the instruments which surround the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example Willard Boyle developed in turn a small light sensor in 1969 during his works in the optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it was not the initial purpose, this sensor is used today as "an eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and brought in the Nobel prize for him in 2009 for physics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our life unavoidably, but it means that one can never really know it...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">With their committee for "Dying in dignity" Quebec discussed recently the tricky question of the life end.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must be resumed shortly although a draft is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, it remains in this important subject area to do still a lot.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir attempted to consider this nearer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago Mr L. only still lived in his apartment in the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate gland cancer that ate it up had let him a period of time of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You gave me to live five years, I created seven years", he said half-heartedly, in his bed in the home for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil lying, in which it had arrived on day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"However, it is always a three-score, on that one cannot be prepared", he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The illness does their work: an immense weakness hinders him at going only onto the toilet and even eating himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the table in front of a delicious lunch sitting, he agrees resignedly to making be helped during the food.</seg>
<seg id="12">Courageously he even succeeds in smiling and speaking with the foreigners who are around busy around it, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the usual death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is my greatest wish that one cures my diarrhea since this is humbling" he informs.</seg>
<seg id="15">The team found a remedy some hours later for this evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our life we find out that a man pees in the stand", tells Pierre Brodeur, psychologist, in the home Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">To return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"That hangs from the ability of the person", to accept a regress, he finds.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because in the view of several persons who work in the palliative care great events occur among these regresses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients who are introduced to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois stand all of them at cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">You have a maximum durability of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">In this stage they "do not cure" more from the doctors and nurses that see to them with so-called Maintains covers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Ms A., 89 years, the worst apprehension is, "conscious and through suffocation" die.</seg>
<seg id="24">But through the illness I became acquainted with my children really.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children", she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I do not have any wishes anymore in the living", she says before her accepting that one puts her on a mask which helps her during the buckling.</seg>
<seg id="27">She expects another last visit of their Sohns which comes from Italy in the next days in spite of that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the home Victor-Gadbois one offers with a group of volunteers care of the body and support during the absorption of nutrients at.</seg>
<seg id="29">The palliative care is used, when there are not any other possibilities anymore.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to arrange the death more pleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec a bed comes to 11,700 inhabitants for the palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is very little if one considers that we will die one day all of them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here the life is continued under best possible conditions, declares Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Both on level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">One gives a mouth care with brandies or Pepsi the moribund according to wish.</seg>
<seg id="36">The diabetics do not have to control their blood sugar mirror anymore.</seg>
<seg id="37">And the death is part of the everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening we served a beer to Mr X who died in the course of the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning his son will drink up the beer to feet of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help members and patients equally", tells care directress Nathalie Savard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">No day as the other one is in the home Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to an old man of 93 years that enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is supported well from his pillows while one is drinking a toast for his honors a young man of 36 years that is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, in tragic way, dies after he attempted everything in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For six months three to five beds are always busy with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years", Dr. Christiane Martel splits up worried with.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients introduced to the home Victor-Gadbois come from their dwelling, 47% come from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of the access to the palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That is one says with regard to a care that is supposed to ease the suffering of patients that 77% of the Canadians do not have any access to the palliative care when latter the final stage of their life have reached, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organizations, as the home Victor-Gadbois and the society for domestic palliative care in the Montreal greater area specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Exactly this great inadequacy in the health supply Quebecs worries for several doctors of the discharge of a law for the regulation of dying-help and assisted suicide with objections specialized in the palliative care expecting.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since the month of October a manifesto in the circulation is that was signed by prominent personalities of the palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe in order to show their contradiction to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel the health system Quebecs is not efficient enough in order to guarantee that all right have to proceed onto a qualitatively high-quality palliative care with the dying-help before one accepts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, I a patient that was 14 days with great pains in the emergency admission saw without one taking measures for their relief.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that only therefore the patients want to die because they do not receive any adequate health supply.</seg>
<seg id="53">And simultaneously several oncologists treat their patients doggedly in spite of worst predictions up to the last day.</seg>
<seg id="54">The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when it aborted a cumbersome chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I informed my oncologist that I will abort the treatment, she answered to me, she told that she regrets that I give up the fight.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, she had said to me that I am at the end!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No omnipotent care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients that asked for dying thank the nursing staff that it did not allow this wish after their pains were eased by a team of the palliative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">It must be said, however, clearly that the palliative care is not omnipotent during the pain treatment.</seg>
<seg id="60">To Elsie Monereau, 8% of the patients do not speak to head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Montreal greater area about a pain treatment.</seg>
<seg id="61">Completely at the end of the life the doctors access to the terminal Sedierung that comes to that thus frequently the patient either sporadic or durable to at the moment of his death make sleepy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We cannot do longer as if we do not perceive this page of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Patients without pain relief will have increasingly more frequently the possibility to access to this terminal Sedierung.</seg>
<seg id="64">They all say the same sentence to patients whose pains are not eased: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not mean unavoidably, "I want you to make me sleepy", but "I would like, that my pains are eased".</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Immovable scandals of great extent in Quebec</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Officials of the road authority, enterprises of the construction head trade, Geldbeschaffer of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a splendid "system" in which building industry trade, officials, politician, trade unionist and mafioso are knitted.</seg>
<seg id="3">An "industry" which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebecs, in particular in the 1990th and 2000th years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"It is strange as the system falls apart since one took drastic measures" Jacques Duchesneau, representative in Quebec and former conductor of the police of Montreal, jokes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The scandal was uncovered by it due to an investigation of the embezzlements in connection with the contracts to road construction works in Quebec coming in which the former prime minister had agreed to only unwillingly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Duchesneau report" established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Since the beginning of the investigation in the year 2010", emphatically it, "the traffic ministry" would have "saved" a billion dollars "alone "at the contracts", because some zügelten in this case their instinct in order to receive their part!</seg>
<seg id="8">The Charbonneau-commission brought already two mayors to case, he adds to show the tactics in the hope that she succeeds in it behind the individuals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">One 2011 started up, permanent anticorruption unit</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The 2011 started up, permanent anticorruption unit undertakes also great efforts with their troops at auditors, investigating and analysts of the government.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition the policemen of the "Marteau troop" that has caused since 2009 that the "canalization cartel" goes ahead from Montreal during the artificial inflation of the contracts more cautiously...</seg>
<seg id="12">In the last weeks she carried out serial house searches and raised accusations against local mandate carriers as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is a mayor of a suburb, because of fraud and corruption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, which resigned just from his office as mayors from Laval, the third-biggest city of Quebecs.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is suspected, repeats in the exchange for public tasks bribes have received.</seg>
<seg id="15">Expressly engineers of the road authority were accused after all the way by Montreal, as well as entrepreneur of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Latter one aroused sensation when it explained the mode of operation of the "system" to the commission for the receipt of public tasks.</seg>
<seg id="17">He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts preserved in Montreal to a mediator being connected to the Mafia that transferred the money to the Montreal union several years long the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Zambito had in the 2000th years his hand everywhere in the game, when it more than 88,000 Canadian dollar (approx. 68,000 euros) at province parties gave, particularly onto the liberals then been at the power.</seg>
<seg id="19">He also confessed, to have organized an illegal mid procurement for the former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Canalization contracts whose costs were blown up by it artificially</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal the "system" of the corruption functioned smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="22">The former civil engineer engineer Gilles Surprenant described this fully detail before the commission: in ten years he received from the building contractor presents, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes at the level of 736,000 dollars as a return service for canalization contracts whose costs it blew up artificially.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials of the road authority admitted that they could be lubricated in their blowing up the bills with wrong addition services artificially around 30-40%.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he overlooked on purpose a shadow budget that filled his cash boxes with black money.</seg>
<seg id="25">Due to these disclosures Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which flung Montreal into a hard crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal blind was one of the first representative of Montreal to beat alarm.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a mayoress of the municipal district district district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she revolted from 2010 against the sale of a municipality plot, that for 5 million dollars was acquired and for 1.6 million builders in the boomenden property market were resold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of black money in the choice campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">From the investigation that finally is carried out she says, that they "at a thread that it makes possible to understand the mode of operation of the system unterwanderten by ants in order to stop the evil and to denounce the guilty parties pulls".</seg>
<seg id="30">She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive".</seg>
<seg id="31">We are at cleaning the wound, would need, however, an investigation unit specific only for Montreal, as well as a supervision, in order to prevent a return of the questionable practices.</seg>
<seg id="32">How one cleans.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau says for his part its part, about Officials stealing several hundreds of millions of dollars is, particularly concerned, however, about the role the "Mandate carriers that are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not complex into the fraud!</seg>
<seg id="35">Departing from a part of 70% of black money during the financing of the choice campaigns in Quebec he jokes: "It was said to me that this is only a weak poor copy of the reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The government Quebecs suggests to restrict the donations to parties to 100 dollars which would not change anything at the situation according to it: "As long as the election campaign editions are not restricted severely, black money will be in the politics in the circulation."</seg>
<seg id="37">He recommends a complete reworking of the system for the allocation of public tasks and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall more deeply; when we go the things with courage onto the reason, we can reconstruct the house on a sounder basis with more controls and laws."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this history damages the international renown of Quebecs and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau asks those ones who laugh at that to fling a look into their own back yard...</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is not the FC Barcelona"!</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season you accepted a new extent with PSG.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">One can declare it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">Splendid players came.</seg>
<seg id="6">I make progress daily at their page.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical personnel gave me also a lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">These elements encourage me daily to correcting my game level.</seg>
<seg id="9">And with the case of a game this is even simpler.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the soccer everything goes very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not burst out in enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my beginnings in the center of the preliminary training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time with Saint-Etienne I have done always step-by-step progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">You do thus the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti zunutze...</seg>
<seg id="14">The new records of this summer are accustomed at delivering games of very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">You also know that every training unit is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="16">This provides, that a player must offer as I, the forehead and wants to give his best.</seg>
<seg id="17">After all the way Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot with respect to my game position.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is supported by co-coaches as Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Is Ancelotti the correct person for the task?</seg>
<seg id="20">Natural.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti instills respect into all technicians.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ligue 1 there is not currently any comparable person, and it numbers among the best coaches of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He looks back upon a rich experience and won many titles with associations looked at.</seg>
<seg id="24">He had contact with tall players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that he will win further titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I held an encouraging conversation with it.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then I had recovered just from an injury series.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence which he put in me is also a declaration for my services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Ligue 1 Lyons took the place of the top rider from us.</seg>
<seg id="31">We lurk, however, in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our most important objectives is the champions League: we qualified in this manner for the round of 16.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the objective of the association in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will attempt to come so far as possibly.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, we will have to speak our word against very good European teams.</seg>
<seg id="37">First of all we want to become First of our group for postage so that we can deliver the Rückspiel of the round of 16 as a home match.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can the PSG in the short term become a large European association?</seg>
<seg id="39">He has already the budget for that...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to become a large European association, Paris must win titles and make a name to itself on a long-term basis.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is not today the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially the PSG gives himself the means so that this intention accepts concrete forms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 as this was the case in the last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">This would be natural a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year creaming off this title really suits to us at the heart.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season we were thick at that.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May we were disappointed since we were strong enough in order to suffer the victory.</seg>
<seg id="48">We ended the season with a very strong achievement.</seg>
<seg id="49">We closed with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Usually one should be a master with 79 points...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, that of Montpellier, achieved an even better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">I believe that this year the correct one is.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the large teams as Marseille, Lyons or Bordeaux struggle for the title, I believe that we have the stuff in order to win it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">In Anbetracht of that, what was invested and the players that we have it is normal that a lot by us is expected.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accept the complete.</seg>
<seg id="57">If we, however, win at a home match against Troyes 4-0, and one still finds something which one can reproach us for, that with security is a little frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what the people still expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We could never win every weekend with 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We attempt to make a game draft.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team builds itself up with the time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the champions we proved League to strength.</seg>
<seg id="64">You consider Manchester town, an association the since two seasons does not create to qualify for the round of 16 and has made the also gigantic editions!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">With regard to the invested sums one believed projection of you for the game pause with 15 points!</seg>
<seg id="66">That would be called, that our opponents and the French championship except for care would be let.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyons and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, became "geboostet" from this new PSG.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is thrilling.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope for our being the smiling winner in the month of May and saying ourselves that finally we won it in spite of all difficulties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG completely seems to be dependent from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">All the better, that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependence".</seg>
<seg id="72">That is, that Ibrahimovic is efficient and fires many gates.</seg>
<seg id="73">Therefore it came and it proves that he the star is the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere, where he played, it made clear, that it a splendid player is and a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the team we respect both the player and the person.</seg>
<seg id="76">He respects also the persons who surround it.</seg>
<seg id="77">What it achieved is really extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="78">This encourages the others to correcting their game level.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is to one of the best defenders worldwide, also facilitates it all other to do progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">Participating in this EM suited to me at the heart.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately my injury hindered me at knocking out some playing time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw there things which I followed from fortified.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I succeed in realizing good games in the national team.</seg>
<seg id="86">This was since my baptism with the "blue's" my hope.</seg>
<seg id="87">From what happened in Ukraine we drew our lesson, and today we must put an exemplary behavior on the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Which opinion have you to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "blue's"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">It achieved promising results.</seg>
<seg id="90">We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.</seg>
<seg id="91">The national coach is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">How it was also Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would not like to do any comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had reached his objective when it had qualified us for the EM.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope, that Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue's" to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Does the draw forced on the 16th October in Spain (1:1) represent a prelude game?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game gave us to confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Everyone supported all others.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before this concurrence in Spain I have never yet experienced a comparable game in my career.</seg>

<seg id="1">With Bitcoin paying and selling without bank is possible</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Transactions and service charges between the participants involved identified, the opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition a political vision is as so often tangible in these technologies: the conviction, that the monetary system current, arranged from bank monopolies, to financial crises leads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (however in dollar, euro and so forth convertible) as also some protocols for the secure exchange as BitTorrent that facilitates the direct exchange of files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With 15,000 computers in the network already about 200,000 transactions were understood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some a thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as a donation or as means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the course of Bitcoin had reached a highest level of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell onto 2 dollars before his recovering today on about ten dollars (the courses are performed on the web page bitcoincharts.com) five months later.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing especially Impressive in comparison with the world trade of real currencies or finance products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless the European central bank (EZB) showed interest in that in a report published in October about virtual currencies.</seg>
<seg id="10">It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in the competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin distinguishes from other kinds of virtual currencies as that one "of Credits" that are used in order to get on in a video game that win one through playing or buy (and also exchange back sometimes) can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook developed also such a system.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the trade is controlled each time by a central authority and dealt.</seg>
<seg id="14">With Bitcoin all key switching centers nodes switching centers are simultaneously keepers of the account book, testers, money-emitters as well as buyers and sales assistants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network function?</seg>
<seg id="16">Every transaction between two users occurs in reality between two e-mail-addresses in the form of an E-Mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the difference that the user can choose another address for every payment what guarantees the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A series of the data being related with this transaction is initialed electronic through a double encoding system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The network can check the authenticity of the transaction for this manner.</seg>
<seg id="20">With the aid of the contents of the file is to guarantee it also possibly that the sold Bitcoins are available in the account book of the public accounts spread in the entire network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The decisive step consists in entering this new transaction into this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This happens about a mathematical task which is started on the computers at which the winner who is a kind of provisional central banker has the privilege of adding this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a question of a breaking up of the file, that is the transformation of a big file into a shorter and unequivocal electronic fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it, before the whole "is chopped up".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is the objective to find the number which makes a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">If this number was found, the other knots can check easily whether it is the correct one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is linked with the chain of all other transactions thus permanently, and any modification would change the fingerprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user for the deceiving wants to pay two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other one stays without linking since both different fingerprints have.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer which solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the prevention of an inflation this reward is halved regularly, probable before end 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Bitcoins contained in the circulation are thus restricted, but divisible up to a a hundred millionth on 21 million, which lets a certain elbow room...</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition the difficulty of the task with every improvement of the computer power power is increased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network had already heights and depths.</seg>
<seg id="34">The web pages that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin insertions.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The used weak point does not affect the actual protocols", assures Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium that is an enterprise for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The EZB reports also about the possibilities of the money laundry with the aid of this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">However cash points also this shortcomings on.</seg>
<seg id="38">Important protagonists as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="39">They are accepted by others as the blog-platform WordPress.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyzed from the Weizmann institute in Israel the account book and shown that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November a "Mega-Schlussverkauf" was started.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", Jon Holmquist, which works for the enterprise Coinabul that converts Bitcoins into gold, pleases itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, who is also an author of a book about this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or to a payment without contact with a mobile telephone, uses, however, Bitcoin for the validation of the transactions which are cheaper through that.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition the holder administers his identity and can remain thus anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system can be implemented with the traders easily, and latter ones must install no new terminals or computer programs.</seg>
<seg id="47">You must declare only an address simple, that of a telephone "photographed and recognized" can become, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users, serves.</seg>
<seg id="48">A general trend in the case of which hierarchical systems are reconsidered for the benefit of more strongly horizontally achieved systems is to be noted.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Some time will regret until Bitcoin continues, but in 2013 a turning point point could be", it predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The EZB plans in their report after all the way, the different ones, risks today regarded as high in the case of a success of this currency revalue.</seg>

<seg id="13">From end 2014 there will not be any influx anymore of the Taliban in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since their irresistible advance of 1994 to 1996 the conditions have changed themselves.</seg>
<seg id="15">Then Kabul was empty and the country due to the fights of the different rebellious groups of the war cladded.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your power takeover was regarded then as a kind of liberation and return to the security.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation did not improve until today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban held the common wish the women in a subordinate position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came in 2001 onto the power again.</seg>
<seg id="20">You changed into profiteers when they confiscated plots of the government around them as building land land onto refugees from Iran and Pakistan sell and so benefit from the massive American allocation of suborders pulled.</seg>
<seg id="21">You brought yourself into disrepute, and most of them were not shared even at the fights.</seg>
<seg id="22">As I heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that does not consist of thieves.</seg>

<seg id="33">Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have profited by a certain decentralization at the example of the western nations, but through abolition of the office of the Prime Minister that existed since the constitution of 1964 the USA wanted to make from it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a question of a new poker of president Mohammed Mursi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt is keeping on being ever divided up more then with respect to the constitution declaration which gives him the unrestricted proxy in a temporary way, he decided on putting everything on a card.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the surprise of all he announced on Wednesday that the constitution-giving meeting will adopt his final composure on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week ago the head of state had lasted to this plenum two additional months for the end of his works.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Egypt counts now in almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly changed text, what weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal jumble.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative guaranteed only for an even stronger split of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For his opponents the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" when it keeps on breaking his word and "infringes upon the right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On pages of his proponents one assures that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possibly and to speed up the temporary process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within 14 days a referendum should be kept off.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period which forces the brothers to renouncing their intention to explain the Egyptians the text section for Abschnitt.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president also a kind and manner is it to regain his public and democratic legitimacy during which protest rages in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to confirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time it seems to be convinced by that to Mohammed Mursi that the Egyptians will make benevolent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially as an ultimatum is put to the Egyptian nation with this going back on a rash vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unrestricted proxy", latter according to assumption of the constitution supposed an end should take.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">85 most mainly Islamic members of this constitution-giving meeting adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the liberals did not follow the request.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a word before the constitution declaration in the middle of November it has turned away since they think that they were not in the situation to make their viewpoints noticeable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or the civil society acted equally.</seg>
<seg id="19">11 persons, deputy members, were added to the reaching of the quorum yesterday morning in a rush.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some suit the Muslim brothers very near.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprising that the articles mostly one-consistently were adopted.</seg>
<seg id="22">The commentators found it after all the way entertaining, that the only difference of opinion of the day has come... in the time for the prayer to the expression, since some members of the committee thought that the pendulum clock of the constitution-giving meeting did not go exactly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text that yesterday evening still was adopted consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2 that drew all attention onto itself, remains finally identical with that of the constitution of 1971 and it says that the basic principles of the sharia are the main sources of the right.</seg>
<seg id="25">The salafistischen parties for which the establishment of the Islamic right is an important demand had the hope to replace "the basic principles" by "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamisten the fact that this article was not changed is a proof of their good will and of their respect towards the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">The liberals who regard this only as a propaganda stroke reply "hypocrisy".</seg>
<seg id="28">Because according to them the Islamization of the constitution occurs via other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">In this case they have especially article which awards a discussing function to the university Al-Azhar in 220 in mind, in particular with respect to the inspection of the conformity with the laws of the sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier this is being, there "the persons that are called for a comment, were not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">One can "see" the first signs of a theocracy in that".</seg>
<seg id="32">The apprehensions of the liberals are been nourishing in addition from the fact that the next rector of this university might be by far less moderate than the present one.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Currently no concrete religious engagement is to be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution we stay within the framework of the middle class state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most lawyers that worked on this text, none are Ulema, but academics that were trained partially in the French system" Alexis Blouet appeases, who writes a thesis about the Egyptian constitution transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">He adds, however, "that" "there can be an ambiguity with respect to the article in 220 since the used concepts are borrowed to the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisdiction, Anm. d. Talk.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in future the question to what extent civil judges are competent could be raised to decide on that."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Next to his religious aspect the yesterday adopted text is criticized strongly due to the comprehensive authorities which it gives to the president to the republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim brothers argue, that these compared with the former regime clearly are reduced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">A further quarrel point: the authorities of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wish of the military the examination of the defense budget is not presented to the parliament, but a national defense council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Just the same there will not be any prohibition of civil procedures in military courts as the unions to the defense of the human rights demanded it.</seg>
<seg id="44">Latter inform also of their apprehensions with respect to the text, that they when freedom-threatening look.</seg>
<seg id="45">The facts of the blasphemy are maintained, and insults are now forbidden, which could have fatal consequences for the right to free opinion comment, in particular for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition no article anymore refers to the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">In your opinion the only positive point is the prohibition of the torture through articles 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not contained in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president yesterday evening on televison was having to be expressed, demonstrations for this afternoon planned are.</seg>
<seg id="50">The proponents of the head of state will march up Saturday.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The large and powerful one" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While representatives and Bürgerrechtler are discussing about which benefit the law brings about obligatory language tests for migrants, criminals sell already forged certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Annually 13 million foreign workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is your only objective to earn money for the maintenance of the families remained in the home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On 1st December a law according to which every work migrant must put aside a test which certifies knowledge of the Russian language came into force.</seg>
<seg id="7">Up to now this regulation is valid only for migrants who want to work in the service industry, in the local housing association and in the retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the tests with the time are supposed to become the duty in the future according to Federal Migration Authority for all foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this case one must put aside not only language tests, but also tests into the Russian history and the basics of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Language knowledge must be proved both for the receipt as also the prolongation of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exceptions are valid only for citizens of countries in whom Russian is official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Persons who received their training reports and diplomas in front of the decay of the USSR in the year 1991 are excluded also from this law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Sense, problems natures and protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The entirety of the examination places becomes under the aegis of the Pushkin institute for the Russian Language, the Russian university of the nation friendship, the Muscovites State university, the Sankt Petersburger State university and other Russian colleges'' stand.</seg>
<seg id="15">The migrants can put aside the tests in all cities; already now already more than 160 corresponding centers were opened in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the representatives of the Staatsduma and the Federal Migration Authority.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bürgerrechtler on the other hand introduced question following the coming into effect of the law in the press repeatedly: What brings the whole actually?</seg>
<seg id="18">Which changes does it bring the regulation to have to show language knowledge both for the Russians and for the foreign workers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Particularly, speakers reply to the migration authority, it goes around, to reduce the number the mandatory worker.</seg>
<seg id="20">"A lot talk now about the protection of the rights of work migrants", the conductor of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew, says.</seg>
<seg id="21">Your rights must already be protected, however, against their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.</seg>
<seg id="23">Onto problems migrants without profession, education, language knowledge and medical appraisal push.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is convinced by that to Sebelew that a future migrant without language knowledge will meet people unavoidably with bad intentions that put it into a dark, narrow hut under the pretense of help where it wait with dozens seinesgleichen months without Essen and documents and will slave 12 to 14 hours on day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Many complaints of our migrants reach us.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In the home one is promised to you, and with the case of the arrival you are deceived, you get their passports taken off and you do not receive the promised wage", confirms the conductor of the head office for work migration of the Tajikistani migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not chide, head!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless many citizens of the Central Asian republics that want to earn their money in Russia add, that they not only not be able to master the language of the target country, but also their own language not show hardly in writing.</seg>
<seg id="29">That is not natural so very much their fault, as rather the evil: Only few Turkmenen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford also only a reasonable primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because in their families there is not yet even money in order to feed the children not to mention, to buy decent clothing, shoes and school things for them.</seg>
<seg id="31">As teenagers these children seize then the first occasion for the money-earning immediately.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It is difficult without language knowledge", they admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and inferior."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Bürgerrechtler accentuate concerning the law following important aspect.</seg>
<seg id="35">Only migrants with legal status must put aside the test.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you do not have this status, there are not so any examination and subsequently any official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile the majority of the foreign workers keeps on staying illegally in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Cordially welcome" or "Admission for unauthorized forbade"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many migrants confirm that it is not simple to receive an official status in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="40">Bureaucratic hurdles and of course the linguistic difficulties are the reason.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand roubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">A forged registration can one fast and only for one and a half thousand do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are most mainly forged and not registered we, and cases of blackmail arise from that then.</seg>
<seg id="44">"You want one- or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow is expressed opposite journalists".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Not only shun from any costs for wrong papers"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Already on the day at which the law came into force it turned out that only the registration documents of the migrants cannot be forged.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some forged certificates that certify the completion of the language test were fitting-taken already from employees of the Federal Migration Authority.</seg>
<seg id="48">The forged papers were printed with a usual color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course the new owners did not receive these for nothing: Every migrant who hoped for being able to spare himself the tests so paid seven thousand roubles for the document.</seg>
<seg id="50">That is more than twice so much as the costs for the official test are: This costs a work migrant three thousand roubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Over the most important immediate task consisting in protecting the system against corruption so that the certifications can simply not be bought both office-bearers and Bürgerrechtler agree agreed to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="52">For the moment the authorities can only promise foreign workers who fall through the test with the case of the first time that they receive time for a language basic course.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition places in fields in which no active communication with people is necessary are offered newcomers without language knowledge.</seg>

<seg id="7">Not they are all satisfied with the Russian authorities wanting to oppose the problems through "Attraction of the screws".</seg>
<seg id="8">In the Internet an open letter was published, that authors - representative of different arm associations - demand from the authorities, to refrain from "senseless sharpenings".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percent of the crimes with registered arms is very small, the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC, expressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior Office 142 crimes with application of the registered arms were committed during six months in 2012 while for the same period in total 1.168 thousand offenses were being noted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are convinced that a sharpening of the law will not keep for private arm owners criminals from serving oneself on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time of one can find according to the authors in Moscow every possible arm for little money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile the Ministry of the Interior Office stresses that the circulation of illegal arms is under control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Suppliers: of the factories up to the officers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The arms reach over several channels on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="16">There are such forward channels channels to five tells former colonel Viktor Baranez, who was active ten years in the education ministry and in the general staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screenshot of a web page which accepts arm orders</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first channel is the army and/or the military, that is arms that were stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The arms were stolen both by the Russian officers as also the Caucasians themselves", says Baranez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">On the second channel illegal arms come which are stolen from order guardians by criminals.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranez explains that arms which both from the armories of the police and directly were stolen by employees of the prosecution authorities number among that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Further illegally sold arms come from military arm warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="23">Near many military camps it resulted frequently in explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There are proofs that it was a question of arson in some cases in order to hush up the absence of arms", says the former military member.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Also the arm manufacturers achieve a contribution to the black market according to Baranez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Nowadays there are innumerable private armament factories, not stand firm that of the international competition and therefore the arms secretly on the black market, about instance in Moscow, squander", the expert tells.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">A further channel of the black market is the smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Over there there are an own, sometimes handicraft production as well as a Mafia which organizes the smuggling, explains the former military member.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">From where do the arms come?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts calculated, which part each of the five channels has at the supply of the black market of illegal arms approximately.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the year 2011 a report by the center was written for problem analyses and state administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior Office and the Federal service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the topic arms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The predominant part of the illegal arms comes according to the observers from the army and the legal protection authorities.</seg>
<seg id="35">Is half of all arms on the black market there through the "fault of persons responsible in charge, who have to do in their work with arms reaches", it is called in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">According to the data of the researchers 17% of the arms come from conflict fields, 14% go back to thefts during the arm production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">A sale consultant of an arm shop which does not want to be named in particular assures that nobody already long buys arms which are found in the case of illegal excavations anymore since they went out of date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">According to it it is more frequent that traders get themselves the supplies in an arm warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="39">About an officer cadet an arm, for example a pistol of the type TT, is bought.</seg>
<seg id="40">The arm is switched off and handed over through the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The trader brings the arm into the city and sells it there for 900 euros apiece with two magazines", he tells</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The police know answer of course above all and carry out therefore periodically control purchases with traders which illegal arms offer if she cannot keep to the plan for the exposure of crimes" adds the sale consultant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"As in the luxury loading"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Buyers and sales assistants think of the most frequent about acquaintances to each other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I had had a look at web pages and blogs, than somebody onto me became attentive and to me suggested to the station to come "To Begowaja, where a person would wait for me, that would bring me onto a certain place" where we could discuss the price then.</seg>
<seg id="46">I found out the price for the arm first there</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Military commentator Viktor Baranez</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"In order to get an arm, I need an acquaintance who has contacts", tells the sale consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I do not trust in it".</seg>
<seg id="49">There are traders on the markets, nevertheless there one must go and arrange to see with a code as "of Iwan Iwanowitsch, who can orientate, that the daughter lost a tooth".</seg>
<seg id="50">I come currently even onto some brass knuckles about an acquaintance who I trust in.</seg>
<seg id="51">It also provides me with the brass knuckles only therefore because he knows that I it not verpfeife.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Newcomers search for arms on different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former military member Viktor Baranez tried in the middle of the 1990th as buyers of illegal arms when he wrote an article on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="54">The pattern's's have changed according to it not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was shown.</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt myself as in the luxury loading", the military member remembers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer does not get the cat according to Baranez in the bag, but he can try out everything.</seg>
<seg id="58">I than potential customer does only simply not buy, but he goes with the sales assistant into the forest, and there we set up a target.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I can fire then there, and if I am convinced by that, that the arm has a good shot, we negotiate "with each other", the expert describes the procedure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">Shopping from the sofa</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Internet search engines show search result to web pages and groups in "Vkontakte" where arms are offered "for different purposes".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Neither any papers are not needed still there are personal meetings.</seg>
<seg id="63">"You need only the suitable sum money", it is said in the advertisement on the web page "Buy combat pistol or rifle".</seg>
<seg id="64">There users give up your orders and inquiries set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Are also minors sold to?</seg>
<seg id="66">"Natural without license", user "Iwan" (literal quotation) asks.</seg>
<seg id="67">"A TT buys. Moscow", the laconic inquiry of "Fedorenkow" says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">The Federal Security Service switched recently innumerable appearance web pages, and buyer, that arms want to gain, go to the service zuhauf into the net.</seg>
<seg id="69">The people come as hungry fish with the case of the feeding and arrive then in Siberia and may shovel coal</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I heard about following pattern: The web page is registered usually abroad, and Russian laws do not find any application.</seg>
<seg id="72">The persons responsible in charge accept the orders.</seg>
<seg id="73">The buyer transfers the money above a bank automat.</seg>
<seg id="74">"He receives as an answer a photo and a description of the cache of the arm", tells the press agent of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Viktor Baranez stresses that one can go out also emptily to the end, when one places an inquiry on a web page, and come behind gratings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">The Federal Security Service switched recently innumerable appearance web pages, and buyer, that arms want to gain, go to the service zuhauf into the net.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">During the purchase of illegal firearms prices of 100 to 900 United States dollars are to be reckoned according to experts.</seg>
<seg id="80">According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" one can buy a pistol of the type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">One must wait up to one months.</seg>
<seg id="82">The arm is distributed in military arm warehouses by minders of middle rank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior Office the number of the offenses with illegal arms decreased about 7% in whole Russia in the period of January until October 2011 on 22.9 thousand while the number of the uncovered cases of theft and blackmail in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives agents and explosive devices around 7.8% was shrinking.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In the USA fasting-Food and supermarket employees strike</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every fourth US American young person is sometime behind the cash box of Mc Donald's</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the last days it came everywhere in the USA to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fasting-Food-chains as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Nor nobody can predict whether the protests will swell still further or whether they already soon run out of the air again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Next to the rise of the modest wages of simple Walm kind- and the organizers of the protests pursue fasting-Food employees the aim of founding trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Up to now this branch of the economy is not organized in a hardly union-related way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, at the so-called Black Friday at which in the USA clearance sales that attracted millions of customers occurred, which now and then led to brawls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day some Walmart-Mitarbeiter from which there is worldwide 2.2 million laid down their work and branches of the chain whose target group persons of low and middle income are picketed together with trade unions and left activists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells all products, of baby's napkins about hunting guns and car batteries up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The product in the Walmart-Filialen is on average between 8 and 27% more favorable than in big supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore many of the insignificantly paid Walmart-Beschäftigten shop only at the own job.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prices and the array of goods turned Walmart into one of the greatest enterprises in the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics Walmart can often sell the product so favorably only therefore because the employees are paid badly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Latter ones complain also about difficult working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the protests at the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their annoyance over the contribution having increased from 30 for the factory-owned health insurance on 100 dollars in the month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Walmart-Mitarbeiter who earns 9.5 United States dollars the hour cannot afford this rise, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Proving more brashly from the Californian university in Berkeley that it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars if the enterprise increases the average wage to 12 dollars the hour.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those ones are approx. 1.1% more than they donate for wage now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart would completely put down the wage increases onto the customers, every purchase cost her only 46 cents more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">Per annum those ones would be for them in comparison with today additional expenditures only of 12.39 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Proponents of Walmart state in a satisfied way that it resulted in protests only into nine Federal states and these did not give any losses to the enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Black Friday lasted the next day in his cases of 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">In total the Walmart-Kassen carried out almost 100 million transactions at the "Black Friday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The speaker of the enterprise, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the web page of the left-wing Huffington mail office, that "less than in total five" Walmart-Mitarbeiter laid down the work and the protest action was only "a further" PR trick" of the trade union that organized the protests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free cash box"!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests went on this week into New York, where their objective, however, not Walmart-Filialen (that does not want in this advanced city and that therefore are up to now inexistent), but McDonald 'it and other economical restaurants were.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald 'it say, the enterprise sells billions of portions, and in spite of that one does not give you any sick person days, and you are not paid for your honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, member of the New York town council councillor</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently the minimum wage is according to federal and New York legislation near 7.25 dollars the hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Fast-Food-Restaurants the minimum wage little by little is raised, not gotten, however, too strongly, and on average their simple employees in New York 8.90 United States dollars of the hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less than they nobody deserves in this expensive city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How it is possible to manage with so little money in New York is inscrutable to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was once a time, in that one almost a quarter of all US American young people to the school with McDonald stood'it behind the bar, however, the young people still lived with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hardly one saw the main source of income in that or intended to remain longer there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now meet me in the case of interviews with employees of McDonald 'it constant people that complain about their having to manage with this wage and feed even their children sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand there is Street journal in the forum of the newspaper rampart a comment that Verfasser says it is irresponsible to get children if one does not know as one is supposed to feed her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protests, that "began" on Thursday at 6.30 o'clock in the morning before the McDonald 'it in the 40th Street and in the Madison avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 United States dollars of the hour which corresponds to more than one doubling of the present minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">You kept on demanding the education from trade unions in the fasting-Food-branch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The US American law forbids it the management to suit this objective in the way and to admonish union members off or to release.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand the management does simply not do it to them.</seg>
<seg id="43">The foundation of trade unions in the fasting-Food-branch is, however, difficult also for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Dissatisfied ones</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">There were loud protests on this day also in front of many other Fast-Food-Restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The climax of the protests was a meeting at the noon in front of the McDonald 'it at the Times Square with which some local democrats spoke under that town council councillor member of Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald' it say, it sells billions of portions, and "in spite of that one does not give you any sick person days, and you are not paid for your honest work"!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were supported also by other prominent New York democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio that said that "we should support the fasting-Food employees common so that they receive a just wage and can achieve the economical prosperity that every New Yorker earns"!.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">According to New York Times this was the greatest action of their kind in the history of the US American fasting-Food-industry.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, only some a Hundred people from whom all in which in New York tens of thousands work are not busy by far in the fasting-Food-branch were on site.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Nor it is not to be foreseen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The brain is made outwit up to now only moderately"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The topic of the broadened reality popular with supporters of modern technologies is perceived in last time for usual by the lens of some specific glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">First Google presented a functioning model in the summer during his annual conference, in November it became known then that also Microsoft had applied for a corresponding patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the conversation with the conductor of the group for interactive three dimensional technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes, however, clear that the glasses were only a passage station for the scientists of the enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="5">It provokes the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Describe please shortly which investigations your group practices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We occupy ourselves with the communication of Mensch and machine, want to enlarge in this case the borders of this communication, however.</seg>
<seg id="8">Up to now the mankind got stuck most mainly in the phase in which with pixels on flat screens is worked that sometimes is also affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">We, however, want to look 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this communication.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example the Xbox-console and the Kinect-sensors are a progress, and nowadays no Xbox anymore without Kinect is sold since they all are interested in movement control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What expects us still in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although Kinect brought the communication onto a physical level, many things still happen on the flat screen, sometimes in three dimensional.</seg>
<seg id="13">The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the edition up to now not yet decisive.</seg>
<seg id="14">We attempt to change that, work on real tridimensional representation systems on the basis of different technologies, under that projections.</seg>
<seg id="15">We must discharge the computer world in our physical world and make it more definable.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this purpose it, however, is necessary that not only the user, but also his surroundings is recognized.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we could much more simply complement the real world with virtual objects.</seg>
<seg id="18">And most first of all we should become these goofy Virtual-Reality-helmets loosely!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about voice activity detection?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is popular, however she does not become overrated?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- It is surely not the space purpose solution since it raises questions to the privacy because one would not like to inform always all bystanders of his actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Actually every kind of communication with computers is good, however, everyone in their certain niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example we worked in the field of the control of objects on public places at a project, at which we statt with short and brief, with projecting gestures experimented.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this case the gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">Still it is relatively large, could be reduced theoretically, however, onto the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, in total the future belongs, however, to mixed control types, for example gestures and language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- As that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- We would ask me for giving you this soda water can you for example?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say it and point simultaneously at that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Usually I only simply say it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, that would be very heavy to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- That is called, you want the user to adapt to that what can perform a machine to the respective time and what not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not absolutely, however it is a question here of a mutual approximation.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think, that we work must in the next time of sensor types new particularly at the development, that make it possible to capture reactions of persons in a more exact way.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those ones can be for example laser sensors since they offer a good solution in the depth, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- Which claims do you put onto modern cameras departing from your work with the Xbox Kinect-sensors?</seg>
<seg id="37">It mangles onto solution, depth or still something other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of the tridimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be natural bad.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth are nevertheless the main thing.</seg>
<seg id="41">All current technologies are not so seen for us well enough, there the developers of the algorithms more work have.</seg>
<seg id="42">It must not only the solution along the X- and the Y-, but be considered also along the Z-axis.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the speed and the number of the pictures per second are important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The movements of the human being are extremely dynamic and the present 30 fps are openly said, in particular for gestures to little.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay in our lab in talking-moon between 1 to 100 milliseconds at which the present commercial sensors seem likely at the second value (60 to 100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not they all understand how that influences the communication of Mensch and machine very much.</seg>
<seg id="47">I needed an appliance for my work just the same, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Would the number of the cameras not have to be increased?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- Kinect works at the present time with three "cameras", at what one of them is actually an infrared sender and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is in fact a usual RGB-camera.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used for the calculation of the object depth.</seg>
<seg id="52">More cameras could solve the problem possibly...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or intensifying the problem since more calculations would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">A flexible, Kinect-similar system with the case of which we could play with different tiltings in order to find out how that helps us during the tridimensional determination of a position would be beautiful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I remember right, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public unlike Google.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the broadened reality in the everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- It is not natural pleasant always to hold a smartphone on the way in the raised hand, however, I think following: The most fabulous variant would be a "changing" broadened reality with the case of which we could change over over a Cloud from the glasses on the smartphone,</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are a personal gadget and in that their strength (Only you can see private) lies, however simultaneously also their weakness, because a broadened reality by means of glasses prevents that you can work on virtual objects together with others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- We long imagine a moment, that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark of irone One, but accessible also to standard measure mortals is.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem which critics of this idea refer to frequently: There is not any noticeable reaction!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands sense nothing at all!</seg>
<seg id="62">Which answers does your group want to give onto this objection?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures I speak often of the broadened reality representing the seventh breakthrough during the communication between Mensch and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the eighth breakthrough could absolutely become the integration of the taktilen perception.</seg>
<seg id="65">An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an a little unusual projection pad.</seg>
<seg id="66">It perceives pressure excellently!</seg>
<seg id="67">It, however, something solid gives the "pictures in the air" also technologies that in fact are achieved on that to lend, for example produced the interference of some done ultrasonic rays in a certain point, where the finger is, a feeling that currently, however, is still so weak as if somebody would blow over the balls of the thumb.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bands for the wrist which influence the nerve extensions in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- You attempted, the brain outwit?</seg>
<seg id="70">Think it make, that it senses what should sense it if it just sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- That is a good idea, so we did not attempt it yet.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here a further task which we will still long have to fight with, that is a human being that is in a locked room physically of making believe hides itself, it is instead of this in an open, practically infinite room; here we work on drafts with race bands (other than in fitness studios), movable platforms as well as big balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">Up to now the brain makes itself be outwitted only moderately, and before us still many work-rich years lie.</seg>
<seg id="74">Just that does the work on the field of the virtual reality for a researcher so rising: With the case of many topics we stand first at the beginning.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rosbalt continues the project "inhabitant of St. Petersburg Avantgarde" that is dedicated to city-dwellers that form the avant-garde of the art and culture.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the exquisite list already hochrangige representatives of the inhabitant of St. Petersburg art scene arrived, their successes about the borders of the city out go and that often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the one dressed in reds bearded, that one finds once near the Russian Museum, once near the summer garden, once at scene meetings or on Vernissagen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Where always the pictures are also made out by Kirill Miller, big crowds lure her.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is to one of the typical inhabitants of St. Petersburg social-philosophical artist, that create new myths.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a radiant personality of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the eighties and/or at the beginning of the nineties.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is also a man of the city and conjures his fellow citizens a smile into the face through his presence on the street and guarantees with them for good mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently he grabbed himself a barrel organ and became the inhabitant of St. Petersburg Drehorgelspieler since he felt ready at last for this difficult role with regard to his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- Kirill, why you are actually always in reds and not for example in yellow or turquoise in the city on the way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world red is the compromise between Künstler, image consultant and Gesellschaft.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the society all which differs from the grey norm a little causes aggressions and bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="15">I want to engage with the people in conversation, however, through my provocations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of my last provocations was an invitation to the conversation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">- When did you know that you must become painter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- At an exhibition in the culture palace Newskij near which my works were exhibited.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understood, that I must go this way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then ging the time of the free old ones, painter, however, officially not acknowledged then too end, and new and free painters as I were unintelligible.</seg>
<seg id="21">I made friends with the painters of the new generation, therefore with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; "Puschkinskaja 10" arose from that, and then end was first once.</seg>
<seg id="22">It pulls me to the theater, for the fashion, for the music, actually to all, except for the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">- And all the united one in your kind clinic... - it was important to me to stand in the center of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creating artists should meet.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the year 1995 I filled a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and over there there was up to the renovation works a musical-artistic club for the Bohemia, the house of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg Boheme.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember as cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.</seg>
<seg id="26">Cord and his friends sang simple songs for the playback track, narrow tricots supported and also the today announced composer Igor Wdowin belonged to them.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group started playing live "Leningrad" became from it.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began it, but he learned the basics with us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the kind-clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">There our employees and regular customers went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 2000 there was in the press an inquiry in the case of which it was a question of the distinction "Personalities of our city".</seg>
<seg id="34">I won in the category "Artist of the year", and in this way I had arrived at the climax.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a human being of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the present time it is simple to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same one: One can be famous without achieving a cultural contribution in this way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- Your works have an unmistakable style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the current affairs and sharpness of the thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will have an exhibition with the topic "The Russian museum as clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">Formerly I was social, but now it hurts and prepares fear, to be like this.</seg>
<seg id="42">In a clown that all smudges and his tragedy loses.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque tale, and I have grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">Let's save for example the world in our dictating that everyone has to dress himself up complete.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now everyone pays attention to the clothing and itself in an oriented way at the outside appearance and not at the interior of the human being.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, maybe one must not give a human being the hand, but should spit to him into the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">The delusion disappears by the dressing up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A culture city should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, if not I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- Can also commercial art be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">- Nowadays commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.</seg>
<seg id="52">We see the decay of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Formerly the people formed great groups: The bohemians loved the one and the simple nation the other thing.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult them all to like.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not a a hundred-dollar-note which everyone likes.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now you must consider who will like you.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now every cult star has about 100 supporters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- Several thousands come to the appearances of Stas Michailow, however!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Left women come to it, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="60">For cultural reasons 300 persons come and not 10 thousand, subsequently there is less management, money, and everything is ruined.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to deceive her and not to destroy the reached thing.</seg>
<seg id="62">In my youth I painted such pictures which hanged even in a row with the works with a collector from Falk and Larionow.</seg>
<seg id="63">I began with pictures which usually come first at the end of the career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="65">It means: intellectual culture and consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">At all no culture has consumption, that is something very else.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a human being of the last culture and grew up with artists that lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is the culture which I approve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Kirill, what Petersburg lacks?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- Good culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">One says: Servant of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, not everyone of them can deal with culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">With the real czars it was different, because maybe the czars did not understand a lot from culture, understood, however, it that correct experts are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow there are at the present time good consultants.</seg>
<seg id="75">In Peter castle we have the experts which could be, but the way is barred to them since one needs more hochrangigerer experts that evaluate the Ersteren correctly and clear them the way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now only the own taste counts.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same one is valid for the Erarta, however with the difference that they say honestly, that they do not pick up all contemporary art and other museums must search some painters therefore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">- What is Petersburg for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">- Petersburg is not the culture capital; in Moscow there are much more culture and a corresponding fertile soil.</seg>
<seg id="80">On our stones art can grow up only heavily.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural fertile soil, because have for example we in the meantime more writers than readers, and nevertheless that is not correct.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">With us those ones are little a lot.</seg>
<seg id="84">Art must be again modern, so as at the beginning the former century's.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is financed to the city of St. Petersburg from subsidies</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Birth in the cosmos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Earth in danger.</seg>
<seg id="3">Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board work themselves onto the search for a replacement planet.</seg>
<seg id="5">In order to save the mankind, the important question how we can propagate in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet surrenders?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">There are not many choices in my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">De facto there are only two real planets which we could inhabit at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Indeed Mars and Venus", the scientific employee of the Astronomical Sternberg-Instituts Wladimir Surdin says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is a temperature of 500 degrees, while, however, the conditions are being comparably life-friendly on the Mars, on the surface of the Venus.</seg>
<seg id="10">Life would be only in big height or in the orbit of the Venus, therefore in the space, possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The researchers handled the question of the propagation in the space first of all with regard to the flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already half a century in front of that experiments with plants were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fourth generation of the peas cultivated in the orbit did in the least not distinguish from the earthly kinds.</seg>
<seg id="14">It the growing followed from insects, more exact of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the year 1979 Wachteleier were sent to the cosmos in order to investigate how the weightlessness affects the development of embryos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">A very normal chicken develops.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, then the problem begins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem consists in the chicken having to find Halt; it must be able to stand on his legs and start moving", explains the lab conductor of the institute for medical-biological problems AT THAT, Wladimir Sychew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without fixed subsoil the chickens somersaulted wildly.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ten hours later the instincts of the newborns were completely dulled.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chickens did not react to light and sounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Four days later they simply died then.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Twice we made chickens slip and stopped the whole then because it is simply impossible to work there with them" observes Wladimir Sychew for the failed experiment with the chickens in the space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last breeding cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring 2013 the experiments are continued.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, there will be only homosexual species on the biosatellite "Bion".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There was an experiment with rats, which already inseminates into the space were sent.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle nothing special was arrested in this case.</seg>
<seg id="29">"That was just with the biosatellites, but only a single experiment was renewed it, and the investigations must be continued", notices Wladimir Sychew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After the landing the space rats got junior staff.</seg>
<seg id="31">One could not solve the problems natures of the propagation directly in the space up to now.</seg>
<seg id="32">The task is difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals which are torn from their natural living space can simply not follow their propagation urge.</seg>
<seg id="34">Unlike animals can the human being that fundamental.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The homo sapiens is capable to abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless be flying to women already for 50 years into the space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">There was the greatest risk at Tereschkowa.</seg>
<seg id="39">The most valuable thing to have the mankind is the feminine organism.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our seagull flew from that, and nobody on the earth could have answered following question: Does it survive the space flight?</seg>
<seg id="41">Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?</seg>
<seg id="42">"Finally nobody answered this question", says space travel veteran Wachtang to Watschnadse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, only a year after their space flight, the first feminine cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also a cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the year 1988 the second woman gave birth to a son in the space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who twice was in the orbit and performed even works outside of the spacecraft.</seg>
<seg id="46">In spite of that a risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only extremely few cosmonauts with whom after long flights everything went well and they got healthy junior staff.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Per more, it is the more dangerous even in the case of flights to the orbit", cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation, concludes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And nevertheless the mankind must search for new ways in the biotechnology, the radiation protection and the producing of artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The Hydrolabor in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a compulsory station during the flight preparation.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in a suspense state the cosmonauts gain routine for the work in the open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water represents the weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is some foreign surroundings; however, babies feel water as a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is, as the Ichtyander small ones would lay down report of that that the life at the country the ocean entstieg.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It gives a connection between the fact that there is a child about 9 months in the stomach of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that that it can become accustomed to water more easily then.</seg>
<seg id="56">Basically that is logical since from the birth up to the first swimming 2 weeks just go by once.</seg>
<seg id="57">"That is too little time in order to forget something", says baby swimming-teacher Marina Aksenowa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">While therefore for a newborn child the weightlessness is being a much more natural state, the woman does not manage without force of gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In a state of the weightlessness the stomach and basin musculature forms itself enormously quickly back and it takes away also the ability in this way to squeeze out the child.</seg>
<seg id="60">Na good, we avoid that through geburtseinleitende aids.</seg>
<seg id="61">The birth could occur for example also in a special chamber in order to squeeze out the child.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Aber what happens then"? the question of Waleri Poljakow not insignificant says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand the child needs also artificial force of gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without feeling the earth attraction, the organism cannot shape the skeleton and the muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">A newborn child cannot be put in the orbit into a load suit as an adult for the training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It will lack what is for his life of elementary importance simple.</seg>
<seg id="67">"This experiment that we carry out together, that is the birth of a child in some foreign surroundings, will provide, that we will bring a disabled person," a completely unangepassten human being to the world", the conductor says ahead of the bioethics commission of the institute for medical-biological problems AT THAT, Igor Pestow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Up to now the birth of children is bare theory in the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="69">Sometime she becomes, however, reality if the earthlings open to a far planet in their spaceships that that home for their descendants born in the space becomes.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">NKÚ-leader: Control of the black-system fails on account of the politics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Czechia has good surveillance entities and appropriate laws in connection with public tasks, lapses, however, into their application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz the vice-president of the Highest control office (Nejvyssí kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, says this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"A law is never complete, but it must be used correct - and this is my opinion's with us not the case, Kala comments on the current situation".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Apparently for a similar result also a common control comes through Czech and German testers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As a negative practice example he mentions the attitude of prime minister Petr Nečas towards the so-called "black-system".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently the prime minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - the system is therefore now forbidden or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"A law must have nevertheless his validity, and if something is by law prohibited, nevertheless the government chairperson can simply not come then, and hinder the control office whose duty now is the control of the compliance of the law in his activity", states Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the meeting of the control committee of the chamber of deputies you talked about a common Czech-German project in whose frames the laws of both countries were compared with each other concerning public tasks.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was it a question of there actually?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a question in this case of a parallel examination which we about two years ago began with.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simplifies saidly, it is a question of the European legislative determining how public tasks are to be handled. The single state legislations base themselves on that. And finally there is still the actual practical application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We compared this all with each other, and although the examination is not yet finished, we could find extremely interesting differences. Maybe even still, generally saidly, the laws are "more severe and more perfect" a little with us, the actual application, however, is better in Germany in some parameters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It is confirmed with its not sufficing to make again and again new and more exact rules. One must deal also with the actual application of the right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To what extent can the project be a help to you? What results for you from this project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just such common control could contribute to our stopping calling us in for a Perfektionierung of the laws and the lowering and Austarierung of threshold values constantly if this does not affect obviously especially positively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economic efficiency management means to gain a thing for a reasonable price (what always the lowest price is not) and to exclude illegal enrichment or really criminal actions.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the lowering of threshold values for tasks does not guarantee that we also reach this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maybe it is even like this that we load the system only with excessive "paper junk" in this way, and those ones that search gaps in the system considerably more simply have it to exploit the system than if the threshold values remained higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about the problems during the practical conversion of the Czech allocation law.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system system function in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is here a similar authority as our NKÚ, or does the system function differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What affects the authorities, so the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Audit Office that is similarly built up as with us and is in charge also of a college that only something is formed differently. Fundamentally both authorities work, however, similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also the competences are comparable to a certain measure, at what Germany, however, is a Federal state, that is that there are these courts of auditors also in the single federal states - the German system distinguishes in that from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What corresponds to our state means may control only federal means to the BRH.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public means which are administered by the districts and municipalities with us are subjected there to the control of the country courts of auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What affects the German legislation is that one simpler than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Generally I would compare this without concrete information only reluctantly. Nevertheless Germany in a way some ways is called often model with the case of which one can say that Germany is better in everything, however, not designated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Is that due maybe to there the testers being better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">That does not determine, however as said: I do not like such comparisons especially gladly.</seg>
<seg id="31">To that it is still to be said that also the countries which are a model for us have to fight also with problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise they would not have yes anything of a cooperation with our authority, not true?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What affects the Czech legislation, which importance had the amendment of the allocation law for your authority, you already sense any effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In view of that, that this novelette is first short time in force, does not affect it with the case of our examinations up to now yet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since our controls subsequently occur, one must reckon a certain delay here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We verspüren effects up to now rather in the preparatory phase of future controls - so have introduced we the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of the Unwirtschaftlichkeit and checked with this almost 14,000 public tasks and analyzed -" here the changes will affect as a matter of course since the threshold values are changed that conditions for certain kinds were modified by announcements among other things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">See the discharge of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law in a certain way is a step into the correct direction and hopes that this assumption is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem that the rules become "more severe" and cannot be kept anymore can occur, however.</seg>
<seg id="40">Already under the previous rules the persons subjected to an examination are opposite the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational program of the regional policy, the regional council) in such a way accountable, that every noncompliance of the allocation law of an injury of the budget discipline amounts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is it then reasonable, however, to make the law even more severe?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">My opinion's not in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those ones that attack and want to misuse, and do not punish the system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Only the bureaucracy puts such a system under even bigger pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Where is the way out here?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We say at first once, which way is not objective-leading.</seg>
<seg id="47">The prime minister said recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what that is called exactly?</seg>
<seg id="48">Is the black-system now forbidden or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">A law must have nevertheless his validity, and if something is by law prohibited, nevertheless the government chairperson can simply not come then, and hinder the control office whose duty now is the control of the compliance of the law in his activity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He can say: "We change the law and allow the thing", however he cannot say that we do so than if nothing was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The allocation law contains relatively severe rules of processes specific about the formal carrying out - and that is also correct for the protection of the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">On the other hand it is, however, also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone due to irregularities is excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be complete, but it must be used correct - and that is that what with us of my opinion is missing.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">On some streets of east Bohemia danger exists because of ice smoothness, in higher situations and in the mountains a driven snow shift lies on the streets sometimes still, the street and motorway management office informs on their internet pages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The Straßenmeistereien warn drivers against ice smoothness which can occur in particular in higher situations in the district Pardubice.</seg>
<seg id="18">It can result in ice smoothness in particular on traffic routes of the second and third street class in the circles Lanskroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.</seg>
<seg id="19">The streets I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are handled chemically.</seg>
<seg id="20">Snow lies in particular on the streets in the giant mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.</seg>
<seg id="21">A driven snow shift lies in altitudes on the streets of the circles Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In east Bohemia it is today mainly sunny or cheerful, and it remains to a large extent fallout-free.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">Bezirk Pilsen</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The streets in the district Pilsen are today well passable, however, increased attention is local demanded, and the operating parameters are to be adapted to the weather.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is at the morning frosty, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees under the freezing point.</seg>
<seg id="27">Since it snowed before and the temperatures fell afterwards, it can result on the streets in ice smoothness.</seg>
<seg id="28">Locally fog is in addition to be reckoned near which the view, however, will improve in the day course.</seg>
<seg id="29">These information come from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The motorway D5 is practically without limit passable, the Straßenmeistereien recommend increased attention, however, between the 80th and the 131st kilometer.</seg>
<seg id="31">The roads of the first street class are mainly dry, however, frozen.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov it can result, however, in ice smoothness in a step-by-step way.</seg>
<seg id="33">The roads of the second and third street class are moist, and therefore the reference to possible frozen sections is valid also here.</seg>
<seg id="34">Drivers should mainly be especially cautious on the less frequented streets in the Böhmerwald field.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="39">In the remaining fields of the district the roads are mostly without limit passable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"In the circle Šumperk snow residues still agree on the altitudes.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the Červenohorské sedlo passport the drivers" must "reckon" slush "in direction Jeseník, said an employee of the street administration Šumperk today opposite the agency ČTK.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also their colleagues in the circle Jeseník must in the night, according to their information the streets are free and wet until the altitudes after chemical treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the circle Olomouc the streets are without limit passable, in the circle Šternberk the drivers must go, however, cautiously in forest sections since the roads are still moist here.</seg>

<seg id="44">Bezirk Ústí nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In north Bohemia the Straßenmeistereien announce now several badly passable street sections.</seg>
<seg id="46">Next to several places with snow or ice smoothness the mountain street of Telnice according to Knínice is in the circle Ústí n.K. blocked to the traffic police according to information.</seg>
<seg id="47">The temperatures remain also in deeper situations under zero so that snow and ice on the streets will hold themselves. On the other hand from the lowlands, in particular southeast of the Bohemian Low Mountain Range, no problems are announced, and the streets are normally dry there.</seg>
<seg id="48">Up to now no interruptions of traffic flow are announced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Ice smoothness is announced in particular from the vicinity by Štětí.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to information of meteorologists there were for that ideal conditions in the night - during the day rain and melting snow, in the night of clear skies and frost.</seg>
<seg id="51">Of the main distances lines as well as of the street I/13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and bad traffic conditions are announced to Liberec.</seg>
<seg id="52">The blocking of the street between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches which were pressed from the snow load except the road.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to gather positive energy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about in little as a month the end of the world being supposed to occur?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">That is one of those disaster announcements onto which we people jump so gladly.</seg>
<seg id="4">With our band's The tap tap we rather make ourselves merry about that and say that we are the single band of the world which can gather sufficiently positive energy in order to stop the end of the world or to prevent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December you in addition realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you present the project to our readers nearer?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a question of a national benefit performance which we plan already two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">For that we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya-calendar whose end is in the morning predicted for the 21st December at 11:10 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the day in front of that, that is on 20th December, three concerts occur from 21:00 o'clock in Prague, Brno and Ostrava simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="10">The end of the concerts is supposed to be in about instance too the time at which on the Kiribati Pacific island that lies in a time zone about 12 hours before us the Maya-calendar ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">From whom does this idea come?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Initially presumably of me, afterwards we organized the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">At in order to prevent the end of the world we would like to gather energy not only sufficiently positive but we would like to think also together with the public about in which state we hand over this world to our children once.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the Maya-calendar we developed also a unique collection from shoe, T-shirts, bag and key supporter against the end of the world with whose purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people can also support us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The band The tap tap has together with other interpreters in addition also the so-called hymn against the end of the world with the title "End of the world turns out" picked up.</seg>
<seg id="16">Already today the hymn is open YouTube very liked. Will it ring out also on the benefit performance concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">As a matter of course, and very indeed at the end of, presupposed that everything bangs and the end of the world does not occur...</seg>
<seg id="18">The hymn is supposed to be sung by all interpreters on all three concerts simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition the hymns are transferred together in a direct switching by the Czech Television live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The text of the hymn comes from Tomás Hanák, which plays also the central figure of the Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings along...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you come to the cooperation with both of them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We co-operate also with further personalities of the Czech culture scene, which is associated with our realizing many benefit performances and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We make an effort for binding these people intensely into our projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was proved in this case that most are interested at a cooperation with us, and have fun at that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Which purpose do the proceeds of the concerts benefit against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the equipment of the barrier-free training center Studeo which we work on already six years together with the association tap in the Jedlička-institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pupils of the Jedlička-institute are looked after regularly by readers who help them in the case of different leisure activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since the pupils themselves do not have the means in order to consult the readers, we would like to help them in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In frames of the finishing of the Jedlička-institute an own building is supposed to arise in which we move in then with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At every concert several groups and interpreters perform.</seg>
<seg id="31">For which criteria did you select these?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We wanted to put together a program that speaks to all generations including child.</seg>
<seg id="33">In Prague China skis, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform for example.</seg>
<seg id="34">You find out everything further on the internet page www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are similar "big events" planned also for the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we perform for the first time at the Prager spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year we would like to perform also gladly in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - when we are then in the USA already once - would connect this with appearances also gladly in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are just not small, up to now you are London already in Madrid, Brussels, or in Moscow occurred.</seg>
<seg id="39">A group which consists of people with hindrances is The Tap tap, however.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you overcome these journeys logistically and organizationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five of our members are rotation chair drivers, that is the rotation chairs must be carried in the luggage hold. In addition we must drag along of course many instrument suitcases and other baggage...</seg>
<seg id="43">Nonetheless it up to now always banged without problems, ČSA and British Airways were prepared always very much well that I was surprised sometimes in part already on us.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were not any problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Through your trips abroad you have a comparison as it looks in the single countries with barrier freedom as one deals with handicapped people there and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="46">How did you experience these things up to now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and further cities in which everything functions better than with us we were witnesses of that just in Russia, that in the east still everything is in his beginnings.</seg>
<seg id="48">Opposite Prague Moscow is completely not suitable for use by the handicapped. There it is still unusual if somebody is in the rotation chair only in the city center on the way.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is not even natural there yet that one lets to a rotation chair driver for example in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately associations which attempt to refer to the problems of people with hindrances arise also there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in which respect must we catch up opposite the countries kept on being developed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are still many things in which we hang afterwards...</seg>
<seg id="53">It is still to be said, however, for this purpose that an improvement of the situation ever depends on the bothering of the concerned persons.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is completely usual that also people with difficult hindrances move independently in the public room, into the museum go, be able to use toilets and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is just not, however, usual that a larger group of handicapped people participates in the social event actively there, in that we are tap tap with the band The the west ahead of a little!</seg>
<seg id="56">A thing is respect in public and barrier freedom, but only if from our rows significant sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come, the things will really start changing oneself.</seg>
<seg id="57">Up to now these are only individual cases of especially will-strong personalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Tap tap is currently very much popular. If we, however, go back a few years: What motivated her in the year 1998 to founding a band?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Then I started as an attendant in the Jedlička-institute, where I met many young people who were interested at that, occupying oneself with something intensely.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am even a musician and play saxophone among other things, I founded a Music limited company together with a colleague.</seg>
<seg id="61">Na, and with the time something got out of control that as our presenter, Láďa Angelovič, uses to say (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The band was confessed, however, only in the last years, or am I mistaken?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is right that the cooperation with known singers helped us; in addition we also started advertising ourselves actively.</seg>
<seg id="64">It became conscious to us that the own achievement does not exist if one achieves something and this is not to be seen there to the outside in certain sense.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the EU supporting-money can we us furthermore good readers, high-quality devices and and similar things. achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Was it your objective to bring it to Tap so far with The Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I sensed the potential, that one can approach the things differently.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the show business one today often copies the other one.</seg>
<seg id="69">That is logical in his way since all new one with caution is considered and accepted first after longer time.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are only few really unique things, and I dare to say that Tap belongs to Tap for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression which the spectator has mostly is as a matter of course pity; that is only natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this pity is completely superfluous because people with hindrances are not lonely and left beings who we would have to pity.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who live a genuine life and can develop provided that they have the for this purpose necessary means.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say, that if people with hindrances succeed in something, that not only for them even a progress is, but for the whole society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Was it also helpful for this success that you are a severe head as one hears about many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If one liked to make something good, one must not accept any compromises in many things and also a certain discipline must demand.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is my opinion's, however, completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when find it then that they have the week of test twice, have to complete preparatory phases and transfer a lot of time onto concert journeys, then the enthusiasm ceases at many quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">So it functions, however, everywhere, in every band which wants to work seriously and achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently The tap has Tap twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were there from beginning at, that is since 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only an only one: Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent that.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and the pleasure in the taking part, is with us always welcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Occurs on day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 21 o'clock</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Places of event are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and further musicians</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">All three places of event are joined with each other to the end by live switching and a common interpretation of the hymn "End of the world" rings out "from" the band's The tap tap "falls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">It is an objective of the concert to find the means for the equipment of a multi-functional training center suitable for use by the handicapped that under the name STUDEO is supposed to arise in the Jedlička-institute in Prague. Matter of expense: 25 million CZK</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The entry costs 400 CZK, children to 12 years free, cards are available in the advance booking at Bohemiaticket.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poles and the space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Polen was picked up last week on a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European protection switching request space organization as a twentieth member of this space authority. Polen is in this way the second member country from the former East bloc (to Czechia, which became protection switching request member on 12th November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began in the year 1994 a narrow cooperation with the protection switching request and participated in the following years in several protection switching request projects.</seg>
<seg id="4">The way of Poland into the space began certainly much formerly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Already before the Second World War occupied Polish cosmos-enthusiastic with the space travel in the case of which they did always not find sense in this way.</seg>
<seg id="6">I remind here for example of the lecture of A. Šternfeld of the 6th December 1933 in the Warschauer observatory near which the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Entry for the cosmonautics".</seg>
<seg id="7">The listeners let the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905), however, coldly, and after years Šternfeld still remembered, that only Dr. Jan Gadomski Interesse had shown at his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld won in the year 1934 for "Entry for the cosmonautics" the Prix REPPING-stag donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) an important advocate of the astronomy and the space travel became later.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books for these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Contribution worldwide acknowledged of Gadomskis to the development of the space travel was acknowledged among other things through one of the craters being named after it on the earth-averted page of the moon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in the year 1925 a railroad hand trolley for which a rocket propulsion was planned was built in poles.</seg>
<seg id="13">The author of the draft and the details of this intention remained unfortunately unknown.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clarified yet whether the missile should be used for the starting or for the braking of the hand trolley.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information on that come exclusively from the contemporary press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In the year 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-practiced projectiles.</seg>
<seg id="17">The institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia led the studies in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the documents handed down it is clear that the research had advanced until the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">The research was suspended then by the marching in of the German Wehrmacht certainly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the year 1937 the draft of a photoelectric hunt missile coming from Ing. Rohoziński emerged in the trade press, and in the following year the work "Rakieta" appeared "- torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war all projects for the military use of the rocketry were coordinated by the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was established in 1937, after two-year activity his work was ended, however, from the outbreak of war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Further articles for the space travel were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space travel society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">The first mention of this society occurs in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy in which four extensive articles are dedicated to the space travel.</seg>
<seg id="26">The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the foundation of a space travel society.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time there were already the first projects for the satellite technique, and it was to be foreseen that the exploration of the space would have future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Already in their beginnings in the year 1956 the Polish Space Travel Society PTA made an effort for an entry to the Internationalen confederation founded in 1951 for space travel, and in fact the PTA became already in the fall tidy member in 1956.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the following year the first PTA chairperson became, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairpersons' of the International Confederation for space travel.</seg>
<seg id="30">He held this office up to his death in the year 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 the PTA participated in a leading way in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for the scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type, that RM-1, was finished in the year 1957, the first start occurred on 10th October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did completely not weigh 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 RM-2 began in the Błędów-desert flight tests with the two-stage rocket.</seg>
<seg id="35">The missile was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">A further stage of development should be already to achieve real scientific work in the situation - the missile RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of height winds.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the year 1962, however, the further development was stopped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years 1962 to 1965 became successor of the first missiles of the type RM.</seg>
<seg id="39">The missile was designed as a two-stage rocket, their overall length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three types were developed by this missile (Meteor-1A -1 bar and -1 C), that distinguished in the size of the transportation room from each other for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transportation room with 0.4 liters of capacity, Meteor-1B above 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C above 0.62 liters.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum altitude was with all three types 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the years 1965 to 1968 the Meteor-2-Rakete whose first flight tests began in October 1970 was developed in the aviation institute.</seg>
<seg id="44">Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was in the situation to carry a working load of 10 kg to a height from about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">After that the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Also the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 which two years later the foundation of a national cosaving-committee followed in is Erwähnenswert.</seg>
<seg id="47">Polen participated itself also in the astrionics with Soviet satellites within the framework of the intercosmos-program, and in the year 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.</seg>

<seg id="1">The cancellation of the law about non-profit works is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week the constitution court canceled the law about non-profit works.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision caused a lively discussion in public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is in a certain way interesting to consider the problems natures once from a wider perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalisierten world are based on the principle of the unadjusted economical competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the final effect this means that the single national economies stand in a permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">The principle of the free trade and the free, unlimited movement of the private capital which goes with unbridled finance speculations hand in hand is cause for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the great differences of the value of work (Wages) it results in price tensions.</seg>
<seg id="9">A state is to be meant by this concept, attempted at that of the manufacturers to consist in the economical competition through import of favorable goods when he "surpasses" the competition in order to tear a greater share of the market coverage through that at himself and to increase his profit.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the big standard this means for most enterprises to move their manufacturing abroad or to shop there favorably, or to give up, however, you business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparably high labor costs.</seg>
<seg id="11">There the private capital no social responsibility and so that also no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it supports, the government expenditures expenditures expenditures increase necessarily.</seg>
<seg id="12">This situation is still intensified by the gentlemen being completely unwilling to entrepreneur paying their taxes and replacing the entire-social economical and social damages caused by them by that.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is generally known so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this place.</seg>
<seg id="14">The inconsiderate practice of the private capital manages in the single national economies to kick a situation in which the governments see themselves forced into competition with each other in order to lower the social level of the own population artificially and to lure foreign capital in this way into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words: The governments hand over the own population without regard for the social consequences to the private capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is shown in particular in changes of valid laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is an objective of these measures to force the own population to accepting the dictation of the private capital in particular in the pay bracket.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the one hand this happens through economic compulsion with the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand through the curtailment of the employee rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is the result wachsende poverty, as well as increasingly greater differences between arm and empire.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany it is giving already for some years of public food delivery places for arms that are not more in the situation to eat through own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of the concerned persons goes already into the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the course of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy it results regularly in cases in which employees receive a so small wage that the state must increase their income up to the bare subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal was uncovered also in the case of assistants personnel busy in the German Bundestag Federal Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economy measures of practically all EU south states will come to the same state with the case of which the people are forced under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level undoubted to emigrate (how it was the case in the 19th century), or to suffer for a pittance on the fringe of the society and to hope in this case for sometime private investment capital flowing into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here the question, from where this capital comes, intrudes naturally?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty roams from a country into the other one; or the capital is completely missing now, because work in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco or Egypt and/or in Africa anyway the employees for one fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This completely affects Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theories and media claim up to the satiety, that the state not participated in his own national economy with capital may, and that centrally managed economy leads to the economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private capital insists narrow-mindedly on his point of view, that the state may intervene not directing into the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then one must ask oneself, however, whether not the private capital the politics and in this way the entire state influences in the own egoistic sense or even controls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here the unequivocal answer is: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof of that is the existence of a lobby practically omnipotent and omnipresent in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation in the field of the corruption, the mutual Bevorteilung, a legislation, in which practically all sträflich is, however nothing punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the situation is like this, that a Ministry of State for lack of finances private, charged thickly with the industry intertwined right enterprises with the preparation of bills.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills are adopted afterwards in the Bundestag Federal Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">All power does not take the nation as a basis anymore then as it the western constitutions announce but of strong finance groups that prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Obviously the liberal democracies turn out currently quickly into a situation, wie sie Appian in his work for the crisis of the roman republic at times of Caesar and Pompeius 'describes: "The state was already for a long time understood in the decay, and the offices were filled with power.</seg>
<seg id="38">Against bribe, through unlawful acquisitions by false pretences of advantages or with stone and sword.</seg>
<seg id="39">The corruption was rampant without restraint, and the nation went with already bought voices for the choice"... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state did not "have" any consul due to this downfall for eight months"... "One began already really to talk about that, that the only medicine is an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man must be elected"... Appian thought in this case indeed of Pompeius, but finally the strong man was then Cäsar that replaced the democracy by the autocracy permanently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As shows, the present society is based just the same as in the antiquity on the inconsiderate preference of the own advantage without paying attention to entire-social interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital is not already from his nature to recognize the advantage for the entire society and to put it through here in the situation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites which do in the least not make an effort for deeply issued reforms.</seg>
<seg id="43">We must search the cause for the appearance of the fascism and the communism in the inconsiderate liberalization of the economic systems therefore in the 19th and 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="44">Seen from the present state, the fall of these regimes can be regarded for the benefit of liberal democracies as a certain pause in the case of which the next round already emerges.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact is especially catastrophic, that the present elites that in losses of a hundred dew sending of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters whose witnesses we are already today, possible for future, as well as suit the crimes against the humanity as we know it from the older and newer history in complete ignorance opposite.</seg>
<seg id="46">The cancellation of the law about non-profit works is not a solution here, at least none durable.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of the global and European economical competition it will be forced to Czechia to search ways also furthermore in order to press the social level according to the population below.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore system-dependent.</seg>
<seg id="49">Purposeful political-social reforms that increase the capital participation of the state at the economy that increase influence of the citizens to the government and weaken the monopoly of the private capital in the society for the benefit of the state are the only solution.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">... "that nothing arises from power, or could ever arise Sting sings fragile in the song, that most important verse says in the refrain: "... so that we do not forget how in a breakable way we are".</seg>
<seg id="3">"When my sons wanted none wars, there would not be any", the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, says, in the year 1849</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">After the last wave of the power between Israel and the Gaza Strip there was, as always, an immense number of reactions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ones are behind Israel and argue with his right to self-defense while they are calling the Palestinians terrorists; support the others in turn the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed at the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would not like to write at this place about that, who in these always recurring waves of the killing guilty party and who Opfer is; finally the present inhabitants of Israel were born including the self-government fields into the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the power itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is a question of revealing the readers the look behind the sceneries for me, the look on to whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) are particularly useful in the small spot country in the Near East.</seg>
<seg id="8">My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are carried off by these and they follow from my own sense from who and/or which group of people influence the events of the modern history in a leading way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the first place the history of the mankind is a history of the fight for the power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every epoch we can form an Alexander the large one or a Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What less is obvious is the question whether it was really always these personalities themselves that determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne anyone stood that directed their actions to a predetermined objective.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit to ourselves that we live in a time, in which the fortune of the world focuses in the hand of few individuals, and that this concentration of the money and the power following from that did not arise within the life insteps of a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among these astronomically rich families one that one could designate as a head of the octopus (I do not know whether over them anyone still stands, I do not exclude this, however) pricks especially out - the Rothschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lot people do not write about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Understandably.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the nineties of the 19th century in whose background always the Festigung of their power, the increase of their property or both stood in order to stop the connection of their name with highly-criminal actions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Rothschilds are shared at almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not participated in the central banks they lead wars or equip onto these (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the assault onto Iraq it was 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis only another four stayed at which Russia in the meantime subordinated his central bank to the Russian government).</seg>
<seg id="18">Who attempted to oppose to this family had to pay with the life for that.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused it, to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank began, during the civil war, own (speak: state) to hand over bank notes and was murdered in 1865 in a theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">J.F. Kennedy began, to hand over own bank notes and the FED wanted to eliminate - he was murdered in 1963; the representative Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED because of triggering of the world economy crisis in the year 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The global power desires of the Rothschilds led in the years - 1871 for the formulation of a plan to the Entfesselung of three world wars in 1859 through Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and in this way highest degree of the discovery.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war had to the aim of eliminating the big monarchic state beings of Europe, in particular the colonial domination of Great Britain should be broken by the second war, and the third war is supposed to reduce the world population - 1 billion people on about 0.5 (such a number would provide their comforts and their luxury and would not consume either as many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenicism does not keep on being anything here as the front end) and finally lead to the takeover of the absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method, with which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works on the top, the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution is (order off chao - order from the chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are, however, wrong and always lead to the aggravation of the situation (see foundation of the FED, so that crises as the one activated by them in the year 1907 are not repeated).</seg>
<seg id="25">After they had succeeded through the murder of the Habsburger Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo in activating the First World War, they destroyed the Russian czar empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended with the sudden one, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation Germany (for the destruction of the Russian czar empire the war was not more necessary), afterwards the solution of the Central European major power of Österreich-Ungarns occurred.</seg>
<seg id="27">In order to more simply be able to provoke the Second World War, the bankers made get a latent conflict situation through the politics in their allocating Germany with gigantic war reparations; through that they got the condition of impoverished masses, so that they the German only another sufficiently strong leader unterjubeln must, that designated the guilty parties and offered simple solutions; a further factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who should take the function of a fifth column and also took in order to provoke the war fire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement in the case of which a branch strove for the foundation of a Jew state if possible on the historical field of Judäas with Jerusalem as a capital (Return after Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The already mentioned Balfour-declaration created the assumption for the mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; it resulted in first collisions with the resident Arabian population.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were terrorist attacks on both pages.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler tore himself away now from the chain to which the international bankers had kept it initially, or whether everything ran according to plan, is to be estimated only heavy, in any case the sorrow of the European Jews created the assumption for the recognition of the Jewish state in the concentration camps through the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was set up in the year 1948, and in the same way as the ground was prepared by the war reparations against Germany for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focus for the Third World War.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers will succeed in provoking this war, the Jewish nation becomes similar as in the Second world war to the victim in the most front combat line, this time together with the Arabian and/or Muslim population of the Near East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is not only in the country itself as a gigantic lab, a source of the quarrel and the chaos, but also international (one only thinks of how the people subdivide themselves into supporters and opponents of Israel sharply).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who the guilty party is and who the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where wrong activates only wrong in an endless spiral of the power, at which at the beginning the greed individual and their aspiration to global power stood?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">One must differentiate here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, nevertheless the international bankers put in Israel just the same as with us, the nation, exclusively their own candidates for the choice.</seg>
<seg id="37">The present prime minister of Israel, the falcon Netanjahu, is a typical example a politician's fascism-delicate, the international bankers loyally turned out that does everything for in order to provoke a war with Iran which (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), rapid for a global conflict could stretch, and at the it because of the control of Iran about the street of Hormus only 2 miles wide run across the 20% of the worldwide oil deliveries for a destruction of the world economy could come.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In which light do the words of David Rockefellers appear there from the year 1994: "The only one that we need is one all converting crisis, and the people will welcome the new system of the world."</seg>
<seg id="39">In their idea the new system of the world is a world of the gentlemen and slaves.</seg>
<seg id="40">A world in which the human population of a small group of finance aristocrats uses the rest.</seg>
<seg id="41">To subject a world in which a chip is implanted to every newborn at the birth around this being of the total control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"And it does, that the small ones and the large ones, the rich men and the paupers, the free ones and the farmhands all give a multiplication sign onto their right hand or onto their forehead, that do not buy or nobody can sell, he has then the multiplication sign, that is the name of the animal or the number of his name.</seg>
<seg id="43">Here is wisdom! Who has intelligence, that one considers the number of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film Argo: Wenn's most badly stands, call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979 a mob of demonstrating Islamic students filled the US American message in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.</seg>
<seg id="3">For their release they demanded the delivery over of the Schahs Mohammad Reza Pahlavi brought down who had fled into the USA which had preserved the patronage over decades about his regime after the revolution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the American government there was not from this situation any positive way out - she could not afford to fling the Schah overboard there this the confidence of their allies in other countries massive would have damaged.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was not simultaneous in the situation, in Iran, where the revolution led to the use of a theocratic regime, to put through the release of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a difficult stroke for the call of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco during the violent attempt of the hostage liberation made everything only even worse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Finally the captured diplomats were released after 444 days after negotiations had been provided through the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fate of the hostages caused a wave of the solidarity as well as anti-Iranian atmospheres at home.</seg>
<seg id="9">The collapse in Iran contributed considerably to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan at the premiership choices in the year 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history which brought a small partial victory to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="11">Immediately before the occupation of the message six message employees succeeded in the flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">This ended according to numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA succeeded in collaboration with the Canadian authorities in bringing the refugees from Iran; in this case an extravagant story for the Verdeckung of their true identity helped them - they traveled with Canadian passports camouflagedly as members of a film stick that supposedly went to locations in the country for a science fiction film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of the genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan developed by the expert for "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, required also the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">So that the camouflage became credible, articles were published about this film project in technical journals papers, press conferences were kept off, and the fictitious production society had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of this operation were kept a secret long. The film is based on the memories from Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand he is a realistic Politthriller, simultaneously, however, also a so-called "Caper Movie", that is the history of a succeeded coup de main as for example the film Ocean's Eleven.</seg>
<seg id="20">Through that the atmosphere levels are changed in the film off - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film composure of the same situations there are not any great differences).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand the loose passages from Hollywood that ironically and slightly überspitzt come from there.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there are still the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the discussion table, on the office fields, at the telephone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck succeeded in a remarkable restart start of his career with this film.</seg>
<seg id="24">From an actor smiled at one became respectable director, and also as an actor he is not now the objective of ironic comments anymore.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is not his third feature film after the thriller Any Children's Game's Play (Centesimal degrees baby centesimal degrees, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">Simultaneously it is Afflecks first film not to play in the native Boston of the director.</seg>
<seg id="27">The feeling for the atmosphere of the place belonged in this case to the features which removed the previous films of this director from the standard of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck proves this feeling, however, also in Argo, where Tehran "is played" by Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really occurred - the input sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in their clarity, and nevertheless provides in this case the feeling of the Verwirrtheit and the Unvorhersehbarkeit that sets in if the history moves somewhere once.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect achieves Affleck with his team also with the case of fictitious scenes (the wrong film stick on a bazaar in Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much action at too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to deal also with actually the history not offering many scenes being tight in the cinematic sense.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the Little which he helps the reality with sometimes a little it works, however, quite successfully - what then does not work always so elegantly (the scenes, in which the threatening crisis is averted from a telephone call on the airport in Tehran in America, or also the pursuit hunt on the runway, seem a little artificial).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is to have to show his far too wide dispersion which is necessitated by the necessity too much at action at too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very much indeed charming in their roles as Hollywood-employees, their figures would have earned, however, more room, and in this way they do not stand alone by far in the film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Afflecks film loses attraction a little through that. It is a film, that one pursue with certain interest and in this case the organization and the one goutieren onto retro-style reminding a thriller from the 70th years can.</seg>
<seg id="37">It wakes enthusiasm only heavily, however.</seg>
<seg id="38">As memory at one until today in certain way live piece history and as an evidence of that as cladded, however, the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are it is sufficient, however.</seg>

<seg id="1">Guidelines for the inflation of balloons, for bananas and for the circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The servers' www.bankovnipoplatky.com who pages an inquiry annually about the most absurd bank fees decided this year on organizing the competition "Most absurd regulation and/or idea from the EU workshop".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The plan recently proposed by the EU to introduce a woman rate from 40% in the management of big European companies brought us to this idea", said Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organization of this inquiry, opposite the newspaper Právo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Under the nominated absurdities the judgment of the European court of justice is found for example about the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until then women enjoyed with the case of life assurances an advantage because they represent a smaller risk objectively for the assurance companies companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Wider incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated until end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The actual vote occurs then until end February 2013", Nacher informed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">For the controversial EU regulations the obligatory addition of bio-ethanol belongs among other things to fuels, that is in their consequence nature-damaging, furthermore the prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometers, only because these contain a relatively small amount of this danger material, or also the guideline to the size of chicken cages, because of which became this year of eggs considerably more expensive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Criticism received in the past also the actual prohibition of the use of the concept "butter spread" or also the sale prohibition for traditional electric bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Bananas must be 14 cm long</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The EU apparatus decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry whose demands are represented by a or several member countries in Brussels normally (so Czechia attempts currently for example to put through the demands of Czech banks also with veto-threat).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Lobby-interests also supported that bananas of the highest grade must be at least 14 cm long in the EU and must not show any "curve anomaly".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission defended itself in this case with the argument that it harmonizes only the uneven single state norms which would hinder the trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The norms concerning fruit and vegetable were already softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the tip, that the previous guidelines would lead to a wastage from food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate for the victory in this inquiry is possibly the EU regulation of the last year that the tip must be equipped with according to balloons with the case of the sale that children must not blow up the balloon under eight years without supervision of an adult.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU referred in this case to an American study according to which balloons are the leading cause during the death from suffocation of children.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction is valid already for children to 14 years during the use of Jahrmarktströten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">There are strange ideas also at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Also a guideline that affects the European officials themselves is relatively absurd - everyone that takes an official function in the EU must not use the denomination Macedonia for Greece because of the sensitivity of the topic and must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead of this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in collaboration Laissez Faire with the association of liberal economists next to the o.g. absurdities also the EU regulation of the extent of food inventory on the field of a member country.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU defined in this way the Höchstvolumen at food inventory which was allowed to be found at the day of our EU entry on the field of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">Czechia exceeded then e.g. the defined volume for mushroom canned food for which a high fine threatened us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the inquiry were also from the idea impressed or, however, of the idea to give supporting-money for requests for supporting-money.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas came certainly not from Brussels, but from Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are put at a disadvantage by our not having any sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will "apply" near the EU for restitution", declared in the fall the former agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="27">As an argument he mentioned that the grain harvest was very high and the state warehouses were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Since Czechia has a further way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us according to Palas.</seg>
<seg id="29">Finally The European Commission complied with Czechia so far that she organized an announcement to countries which do not have any access to the sea about the purchase from grain.</seg>
<seg id="30">The ministry offered supporting-money for requests for supporting-money to the municipalities for regional development under the orders of minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), actually it should be a question in this case of means for the Aufsetzung of supporting money requests at Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Regulations become in the member countries the target of the criticism which earns efforts of the EU around regulation and in this way also around effectiveness and development of the entire European Union in opinion of some experts, however, rather of recognition easily indeed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The EU supporting-money is rather a more serious problem in opinion of these experts for projects which do not have anything with the deepening of the European integration together at all in that, which, however, were forced by single member countries at the budget negotiations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Also the fact that Czechia must fight for the right to use of specific denominations of traditional products similar to other member countries in Brussels and does always not gain this fight in this case causes emotions in these parts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Czechia could defend the denomination "Olomoucké tvarůžky" indeed after a six year long fight with Germany and Austria, our manufacturers had to rename the Inländerrum (Tuzemský for that) whose tradition goes back with us until the 19th century in "Tuzemák", however.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Denomination For that may be used only for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of the products registered in the EU dive in the society of the world-famous cheese sorts Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker marzipan's or the Parma ham's now also the Karlsbader rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer hop on.</seg>
<seg id="38">With a EU brand can boast there the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer roles.</seg>

<seg id="13">My objective is not, however, the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.</seg>
<seg id="14">I need a lot of influence and a mandate as strong as possible for that if possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The difficulty does only not consist, however, in our chiding as a nation in the pub and before the television set, but massacring everyone who wants to change something.</seg>
<seg id="16">The media who want to rob one of the honor, and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie come to that.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over was asserted for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant of Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's talk about your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">You incorporated the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and legal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive property declarations above 20 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this purpose you must change laws.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a president you do not have any competences in this respect, and only the senate as a whole can be law proposals worth.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As a simple citizen I supported the guide remaining a free trade, and this could be put through.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is the small-intellectual politics - when somebody of the right or comes from the left with a good proposal, this is refused on purpose, and that only stops the population.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent independent I have a by far greater potential to gain support near all parties represented in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage consists in my being able to take without drawer thinking and party dogmas from every party what is the best thing for our country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you see yourself as a human being in the politics rather to the right or to the left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From Czech view it seems to me that the people see me rather to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me this right-link-thinking is, however, completely unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me it is important that we get on.</seg>
<seg id="31">It does not go to me around whether anyone belongs to the left one or to the right warehouse; I would like to bandage the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always I support in public every good implementation approach even if this of the KSČM or of the ODS comes, and in the same way I will oppose bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It displeases to you if somebody calls you populists.</seg>
<seg id="34">But do you not confirm that through what you just said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If you make a business plan in a company, you have also an ideal objective and a vision then.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you would like to come closer to this.</seg>
<seg id="37">One can refer to this as populism because of me, but all proposals which I spoke of already function in the world, or they were discussed by important experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without support in the parliament you have only catchwords.</seg>
<seg id="39">And in this way you do not come in the politics on a long-term basis far.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that you will succeed in putting through the material and legal liability for example if you talk only long enough to the people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I do not have any other possibility.</seg>
<seg id="42">To convince politician, journalist and the public and to attempt, to bring page in order to put through these objectives they on our.</seg>
<seg id="43">As a president it would not be a problem for me to call the chairpersons of the parliament parties for that live on televison to anchor the material and legal liability for politicians, officials, judges and public prosecutors by law.</seg>
<seg id="44">And the addressed ones would have to say then where appropriate why they refuse this.</seg>
<seg id="45">A strong personality who refers to grievances can exert pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Only take the direct choice of the president which was an income of the public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am not either a genius or an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I attempt to find allies for my opinions and visions.</seg>
<seg id="49">I just began with the politics first and attempt to find the support of the majority for my program.</seg>
<seg id="50">I always attempt to judge the things themselves; and if it does not bang, I go back then in six years to the private sector again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">That rings a little bit as if Okamura should save Czechia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am not a rescuer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that I do not achieve only anything; therefore I talked with several known personalities about whether they would not like to run also for the senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I spoke e.g. with Radim Jančura, who, however, refused because of overwork.</seg>
<seg id="55">In addition I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who uncovered the fraud during the trade with light fuel oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I began my candidacy with the condition that the people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not more sure.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the elective ones did not go at all for the choices, and those who went elected representatives of the establishment mostly.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the senate we are in this way only two independents.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people chose such senate composition, that changes will be only very much hardly durchsetzbar.</seg>
<seg id="60">In spite of that I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct choice of the mayors and district head men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about the foundation of an own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Over that because my not having any time I did not think about checking the past of every potential party member yet and has also not at all the money for that.</seg>
<seg id="63">I do not have money for the president campaign once yet; only 20,000 CZK are on my transparent account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You do not have any money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You speak of property declarations, as yours would look?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I estimate my private assets at about 60 million CZK.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague I have a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, that is worth to about 10 million as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb to whom about a million is worth. And then I have still a few millions on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Aston Martin was after all the way a child dream - I always liked James Bond as it went in the car, was gallantly to women and fought against the evil simultaneously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You drive an Aston Martin, have a property of 60 million and do not have any money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">You say that you want to change the republic, but you would not like to invest your own money in that.</seg>
<seg id="71">That is just not convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have any 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Am I supposed to do for instance debts?</seg>
<seg id="74">I put already 2.5 million into the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I do not have any sponsors shows that my program does presumably not wake interest too much.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from own means.</seg>
<seg id="77">The costs for the campaign are covered basically through my salary as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But I could not live from the senator content alone; so I could not finance e.g. my son the English school which tastes 30,000 monthly.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to earn only money, I would run for quite nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Do you remain active therefore further as entrepreneurs in order to have your living?</seg>
<seg id="81">Did you not say that you will drive back these activities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But that is not associated with the height of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">How promisedly, did I drive back my activities in part.</seg>
<seg id="84">Like this becomes e.g. my deputy in the spring manager of the travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="85">The people want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But nevertheless I must live also on something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">Onto which month income were you accustomed as entrepreneurs?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also furthermore like this.</seg>
<seg id="89">I would completely employ my enterprises as a president, however.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The MVRDV architects prove, that the true adventures are not only in the head - at the example of Spijkenisse and the recently constructed book mountain - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I find the building merry, it looks futuristic, and seeing something interesting again at last gives", says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by, at the street edge.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large-scale enterprise seemed likely, means: "However it is beautiful already, the house."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder what we need a library for today still.</seg>
<seg id="5">They all have Internet, iPad and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">No human being goes today voluntarily yet into one of these Old-Style-Bibliotheken, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a hardly inspection-needy sleep city in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 80,000-inhabitant-municipality shows the lowest education rate of the entire Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, one decided on contributing to the general education and reproducing the seven fictitious bridges which are represented on the euro appearances as prettily painted reinforced concrete miniatures some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the education offensive held itself in borders.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so the city fathers recognized that there would be only an only possibility, to become gentleman the statistics: A library must here!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architect's office MVRDV, master of the reckless bar graphs and producer of witty, really often cynical constructions, took the thing with usual composure and appeared for the competition-hearing anno 2003 with five books among the arm and a grin in the face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury was looking still baffledly around itself and twitching with the armpits, stacked the insolent Meuse his exquisite little presents of the size after to a pyramid and his aktionistisch supported speech with the words ended: "Love municipality"!</seg>
<seg id="14">It is that therefore, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later the mountain 30 million euros expensive is heaped up.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is a part of a revitalization project which also basement garage, supermarket, mail office and a few bordering living and row houses with in total 50 apartments belong to.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November "Best library" was characterized the book mountain with the second price "of NL 2012".</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In this way the faceless small town retort is, that until dato more did not have to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a consternatedly ugly city hall behind whose white facades one would be inclined to presume a dairy factory around a piece of contemporary architecture richer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Particularly, however, Spijkenisse has now the first public culture construction in the history of his existing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long way for the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: Book Eldorado under cheese dish with glass cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is indeed a lift that leads right through the massif, however, the true room and reading joys open up at the fußläufigen Climb Up the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The rundum glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker ground and the elegant street-lamps speak unmistakably the language of a public city place.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urbane ambience is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">One holds already look-out of Jungs playing to park bench, dog and soccer and girl.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle a big, dark room lies which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We put the classical room configuration on the head and put the read area to the outside from inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the Bücherbergs is skillfully used: In the middle offices, internet-library, Schachclub, environmental center and housing technical services headquarters lie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The black bookshelves are a special joy, the once wall paneling, once parapet, once staircase rail are.</seg>
<seg id="32">Optics, Haptik and odor are strange.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even confirmed architects and civil engineers engineers shake the unknown material's the head.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work here with recycling-materials", declares Joop Trouborst, project leader manager near the municipality Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we found a suitable waste product in a friesländischen farm of a day from the agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years one is using a millimeter-thin synthetic fleece as a root pad in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is cheap and time-efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">To the thin textile keeps, two Saisonen, after that it is ripe for the bulky waste.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these amounts - to four centimeters thick plates.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under heat action and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, load-capable material which smells a bissl to new cars and a bissl to trainer discolors itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To 105 stages one arrived at the peak.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the almost 500 meters long journey one is rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic prospect on the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted Ficusbäumen.</seg>
<seg id="43">You guarantee for Atmosphäre, for, however, for the correct humidity, in the literature mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"One would not believe it, but this house is a showing-project as regards in spite of the many glass faces ecology", says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heated and chilled becomes with geothermal heat.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the book mountain stands under a glass fall, the sun shines even on sunny days only shortly into the interior.</seg>
<seg id="48">The wide wood glue ties that stand perpendicular to the glass facade are used as shading and catch a majority of the solar radiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The room climate is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">Finish the rest fully automatic window blind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT branch, risked already the way into the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde that "for a long time overdue soul" even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisses.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: For the opening few weeks ago every inhabitant was invited to to donate a book from his personal supply.</seg>
<seg id="55">The optical gaps are supposed to be filled with that for the time being once in the library completely not equipped yet - currently 70,000 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="56">The draft opened.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are to obenhin filled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library is", says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think thanks to our invitation every inhabitant has now a certain relationship to this new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">And if it is only to the glory.</seg>
<seg id="62">In this way MVRDV succeeded in that royal discipline which one mentions identity foundation in the jargon.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">So jung und ungebildet they also likes to be.</seg>
<seg id="65">That is at last a starting point for identity once.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "Germans must play bigger role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained in the vote about the photo from Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">Loud Stephen Szabo, expert for Us European Relationships, Berlin in this way balances on a narrow diplomatic degree.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">German wave: At the beginning of the week Germany had signaled first of all that it the Palestinian would vote against the request for an observer status near the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Then, however, Berlin contained itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis put into Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany must be cautious due to his special relationship with Israel, however.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, simultaneously I believe that it does not support the American position either.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without being, however, too critically opposite Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the revolt in Libya in March 2011, when it was a question of fitting out a flight prohibition zone, Germany also abstained.</seg>
<seg id="12">Finally this was put through by the NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Does Germany fell it heavily to get a clear position with the case of important international topics?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, that is right.</seg>
<seg id="15">That fits, that his foreign policy just rearranges it and indeed away from a politics that became gemanaged so to speak from the USA there for a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Complicating comes, that the Europeans do not have any coherent and homogeneous politics.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans find themselves therefore between the fronts against.</seg>
<seg id="18">One expects of them that they play a more independent role, at that they are not, however, accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe, they still approach their role, but they are on the way for a "more normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, as they have France or Great Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What means a "normal" foreign policy actually from German view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the willingness to get with the case of national interests also positions which are independent from those of the USA or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy of the economic policy is motivated therefore from the exports and his relationships to certain regions, about instance Russia, China or the Near East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are different to a certain degree than those of the other great powers are and therefore Germany must protect his interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests had influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the one hand Germany has big markets in the Near east, especially in the Gulf State.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore it must be cautious, the public, but also the elites, not to bump before the head in the Arabian countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">That plays in any case a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not want to attach too much weight to that either, that is not a completely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But an important role plays in any case in German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany damaged his relationships with the USA when it abstained with the case of important decisions about instance during the vote above Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe, there is great sense for the German position in Europe and even in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore I do not believe that this was a so dramatic break as in the Libyan question.</seg>
<seg id="34">Maybe Germany in this way will record even a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because nevertheless it signals that it is taken as international player seriously and his interests must be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">There are in Europe different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The USA on the other hand spoke out clearly for a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Due to the American inside politics these varieties always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the government has presumably quite a lot of sense for the European position secretly under Obama.</seg>
<seg id="41">But due to the political situation here, the government cannot represent this position publicly of course.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not so great at all as they always appear.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you have a look at the relationships between Obama and prime minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so hellauf enthusiastic of Netanjahus politics at all then.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Does Germany fell it heavily to arrange his narrow relationships with Israel and the USA on the one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other hand?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I believe, exactly that it does so difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">It would be natural a little more simply for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European politics which currently is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore they cannot be a part of a wider line and things must drive forward instead of this out of their own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">They straighten that with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe, in future Germany will take over a leading role, to insist Europe on a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">That is not natural simply for Germany, already because of the relationship to Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">That was always already a sensitive topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I believe that it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself even in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to take over a title role anyway?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or does Germany fell the leading role still heavily?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not yet used to that, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we have a look for example at the euro crisis, there most different anti-German feelings become free each time if Germany accepts a bigger role.</seg>
<seg id="57">That does simply not do it to the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">That is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">Germany is so seen in a much more difficult position as the USA.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be prone to most different neighbors and opinions and that is not simple.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Now the influence of the USA takes in the European politics continuously off, the EU does not fill at the moment this vacuum, however, who stays there otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they do not like it, it is it unpleasant to them and it makes it still much more unpopular - c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection of trade marks" in China: If puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.</seg>
<seg id="3">What, however, is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind that a denomination very officially entered into China which, however, does not have to do anything with the origin enterprises hides itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless she enjoys for so long protection as the actual name donors do not complain.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear whether they are right.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It becomes for foreigners increasingly more difficult to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, attorney in the office Taylor Wessing, who is specialized on industrial property rights injuries in Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week a new case lands on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Already a few additional letters suffice the imitators so that they may announce their brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lu-Gucci simply becomes like this from Gucci, instead of Prada one makes enter Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also German enterprises are copied in this way legally, about instance the sport article manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the brand office in Peking.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 14th September 2010 a Chinese enterprise made there protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that operated itself also near the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That the Chinese are world champions in the copying and in the injured person of intellectual property is known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities there are multistorey department stores which almost sell excluding forgeries.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pattlochs cases, however, are different: On behalf of his mandators he proceeds against Chinese enterprises of the brand office receiving very officially the right to use a denomination which is already elsewhere protected.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese mention that "Bang Mingpai", a co-driver brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word bases itself on "Bang Dakuan".</seg>
<seg id="19">In this way women are meant, that catch rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are not conscious of any fault to themselves</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"That is business-damaging, one must "oppose" it", Pattloch demands.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand that alone position disappears is watered down, the image damage is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial failure rates and the process costs of the affected branches go into the millions, particularly with the case of expensive showing-products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to information of the market analysis society CLSA the third-biggest market for luxury articles and that at the fastest wachsende is China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, deletions of dubious entries in the brand register are to be achieved heavily and go into the money.</seg>
<seg id="26">Up to nine years the procedure can drag on, with uncertain exit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch reports about cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration the name complained about became the "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the complainant has bad luck, he must pay the plagiarist even money because it hurt his brand in China, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.</seg>
<seg id="30">Famous cases affect also graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machine machinery manufacturer Sany, that enterprise that recently Putzmeister took over the German concrete pump farmer.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chinese may use therefore until today a mark which resembles the Mercedes-star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Volvo-buyer Geely used initially a blue-white logo, the one reminded of BMW; the quarrel was settled, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who made the famous crocodile look into the other direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are not conscious of any fault to themselves.</seg>
<seg id="36">The brand office CTMO in Peking admits indeed that there were over there bottlenecks in 2010 because of too small personnel and room equipment.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the last year one "returned", however, from the "emergency situation in the workflow process for the normality".</seg>
<seg id="38">So the supply of raw objection procedures sank around 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">One finished almost 57,000 of such cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless 81,500 objections still wait in the office for execution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Fighting against that costs a lot</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">How so often are in China the numbers impressing.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the last year more than 1.4 million requests paid attention to protection of trade marks at the CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">That is a record and means, that China for the tenth time behind each other the list of the new entries in all world would start, the authority informs.</seg>
<seg id="45">That is valid also for the supply of all valid trademarks in total 5.5 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 1.8 billion Yuan were taken at fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simplifies is said that, that every registration on average costs 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Fighting against that costs a multiple as the case of the German family company joy mountain shows.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years the company group is fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Indeed the Germans could achieve that his illegal manufacture of copied motor vehicle parts was dug.</seg>
<seg id="51">Nevertheless the imitator kept on safeguarding himself the Chinese rights at the brand joy mountain.</seg>
<seg id="52">One himself missed that since in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairperson of the management of joy mountain of Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The brand office CTMO also rejected the objection of the inhabitants of Munich then.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the next two authorities Freudenberg was right indeed, however, the opposing party kämpft weiter until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">One must look out infernally</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the matter is pendant before the Uppermost Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is confident to Wentzler to bring the thing to a good end and the professionalism of the courts praises.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: "The procedure is extremely extensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerve."</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs could hardly be numbered, the company archive had had to check files even a hundred years old in order to produce proofs.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago joy mountain of the opposite side offered in vain a "high six-digit" euro amount" for the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"At that one sees how much that is worth to us", says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers in Far East tend to splash even to Europe back.</seg>
<seg id="63">Then same, if unprotected brands are safeguarded to imitators there.</seg>
<seg id="64">So a Chinese manufacturer wanted to announce the denomination joy mountain in Germany for shoes and leathers.</seg>
<seg id="65">The company group gave up this business field for a long time, in spite of that it could avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"One must look out infernally", says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both it and the attorney Pattloch recommend German enterprises to be very cautious with the case of businesses with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">Relying on international Markenrechte does not suffice, rather the foreigners should announce all which is somehow sensitive also in China as Wentzler says.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise that can become much more expensive than the registration can.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact: If Freudenberg is defeated in the last act of his brand drama, one would have to pay presumably the opposite side royalties then for the own name, declares Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we are pushed in the segment in question from the market.</seg>

<seg id="1">Weltaidstag: Stamp, to sing help,</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland Aidswaisen are pleased with that.</seg>
<seg id="3">The history of a connection which overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First the stamping is there: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, lady court shoes and Herrenslipper search the time on the parquet floor, find it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Unity-two-three-four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then first the voices of the singers swell slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - badger, beguile and pursue.</seg>
<seg id="7">And it almost lifts Fiete Hopf, the 29-year old conductor, from his material shoes if it combines her with his supplely wild gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is Monday evening, in the music room of the institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi practises a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">Onto the fifty singers came, between 23 and 69 years old, of the humane geneticist up to the househusband.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choir voice also still has another text and this in a very foreign language: Zulu, that of eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland is spoken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help for the self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Worldwide about 34 million HIV-Infizierte there is, Unaids, the program of the United Nations to the Bekämfung of Aids, estimates that.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million people of them live in the south of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland 245000 Aidswaisen live.</seg>
<seg id="15">Meanwhile more than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 Aidswaisen in the village Esitjeni the Voices for Africa association found godfathers in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them a weiterführende school visit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros in the month one can take over a sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">It guarantees school fee, school uniform and a warm meal to the child daily in the Gogo-center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">History narrator or also Lobpreiser means Imbongi in Zulu.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nobody can speak the Bantu language fluently in this room, but sing it.</seg>
<seg id="22">For almost ten years the choir is practising songs in this foreign soft language and it returns now and then also there, where they come initially: into the south of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because 8 733 kilometers air line remote of Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swasiland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the voice power of the German choir.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About 2000 people live there, some still in simple loam and straw huts, children are a majority of them.</seg>
<seg id="26">In more than 300 of them no parents have more because these succumbed to the HI-virus.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Esitjeni it is proved on a small scale what Swaziland completely suffers from: highest HIV-Infektionsrate, lowest durability worldwide loud Unicef.</seg>
<seg id="28">Curtailments of the masculine prepuce that reduces the contagion risk nachweislich around half are hardly accepted by the population.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland take the immune weakness virus into themselves, to die with middle thirty is not a rarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At a common Africa journey in the spring 2005 the choir discovered the village, vor allem, however, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets that did not lack only parental welfare but simple at everything: Essen, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without graduation one does not have first right any chance in a poor country.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the beginning it was still the private engagement individual to send a child to the school for a few euros per year and to make a warm meal for him possible on day.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, already a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which takes care of the Aids-orphans since then almost professionally in Esitjeni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts to sexually transferable infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most important sexually transferable illnesses?</seg>
<seg id="36">Syphilis, Chlamydien and gonorrhea (Gonorrhö) number among the bacterial STI.</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral STI are HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Crab lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who are the main concerned person groups?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea occur particularly with men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert-cook-institute assumes that at least four are transmitted through sexual contacts by five of all syphilis-cases announced in Germany between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">With the heterosexual adults Chlamydien infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (Mushroom), gonorrheas and Humane Pappilomaviren are frequent occurring sexually transferable illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="43">The circulation of HIV is comparably small among heterosexual adults in these parts - nevertheless: About 20 percent of the HIV new infections are allotted to this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among young people Chlamydien-infections occur considerably more frequently than with the case of other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">To European elevations three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In these parts Humane Pappilomaviren occur furthermore frequently with young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How did the number of the infections develop?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transferable illnesses are orache-liable.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of the syphilis infections has itself according to the Robert cook institute of 1697 illnesses in the year 2001 on 3698 illnesses in the year 2011 more than duplicated.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of the HIV new infections goes back since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is about instance a tenth less before than per year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Which symptoms refer to a venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital organ field, complaints during the Urinieren, outflow, lower abdomen pains as well as bubbles or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often they cause, however, no pains or other symptoms and remain therefore unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can one protect oneself?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of a contagion, do not offer, however, any one hundred percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Because partially exciters of sexually transferable illnesses can be passed on also through grease infections and narrow body contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore experts recommend regular investigations particularly with sex partners changing frequently.</seg>
<seg id="60">Early diagnoses can most STI cured and be avoided late consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the fees, that the choir in whole Germany ersingt, some comes together.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In total we sent already about 200 000 euros according to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the chairperson of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and enforcement-strong woman, administers the money from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">She also sees to the orphans unterkommen well at one of the grandmothers for instance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The Gogos as one mentions the old women in Zulu the pillars of the village are.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them received up to 14 orphans with themselves, give them a roof above the head and guarantee for the children appearing in their uniforms every day on time for the school instruction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Who does not have anybody anymore comes into the protection house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid just the same by the association as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Furthermore "Voices for Africa" started up a nearer school, built it two chicken houses and organized it together with the American health organization PSI, that many make in the village a HIV-Test have to do.</seg>
<seg id="69">That is not a self-evident fact, because so obviously the illness in the whole country is also, one is silent they most gladly dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"Aids is an absolute taboo, Annette Lennartz says, because it has to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Actually strange in a country in which the king holds himself to 14 wives officially.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch Schwarzafrikas, king Mswati III, is known to his excessive life-style.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Among other things it is owed also to this from a government viewpoint sanktionierten way of life that the HI-virus spread so quickly in the last decades.</seg>
<seg id="76">But also the many migrant workers who take the virus through the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">There would be free condoms indeed at every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "however those ones are hardly used.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is another - flesh to flesh."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to support the cultural exchange something, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years together through the south of Africa and the a lot one still sings songs of full wistfulness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, at the southern corner of the black continent from times of the apartheid know.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus fuller white that sing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only atmosphere and joy, but wrested already from some grim border guards a few tears.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The journey always leads also after Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even if one hardly finds the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Goes according to Esitjeni, there is the light" the people say there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And when one returns the 8733 kilometers air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers into the test room at the Bergheimer street, then one sees it shining also there.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our insights into the space: The most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope is supposed to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - still before Galileo Galilei used it a year later for the star observation.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became increasingly bigger - and the insights that supply it, increasingly deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">30 years long, indeed of 1947 to 1975, the Hale-Teleskop was San Diego near in the Palomar observatory the biggest telescope of the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.</seg>
<seg id="56">It approves looks into the space to more than two mirrors now, everyone with a diameter of 8.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The inner life of the grain of Telescopio Canarias on the Kanareninsel La Palma is gigantic - only the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in the diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">In spite of that it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is lashed up in his altitude angle height - and restricted in his mobility in this way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Also the hobby-Eberly-telescope in Texas is fixed in the altitude angle height.</seg>
<seg id="62">His special feature: the high light collecting-strength.</seg>
<seg id="63">This reaches indeed - in spite of comparably small mirror diameter - onto which the worldwide biggest reflecting telescopes'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the aid of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to the space to extraterrestrial signals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">Every computer owner can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) when he provides computer power power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Look at the observatory of the European observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here the Very Large Telescope stands - that his name all honor does.</seg>
<seg id="69">With his in total four mirrors the telescope can illuminate also the middle infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Also on the Chilean ESO-observatory the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.</seg>
<seg id="71">His main mirror mirror is supposed to grasp full 42 meters - and be put from just 1000 mirror elements together.</seg>
<seg id="72">With pictures people are to calculate, however, in at the earliest 2018.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">To 2007 the two saucy-telescopes were regarded as the largest of the world on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea.</seg>
<seg id="74">You offer now two mirrors with an average each of ten meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">The saucy-telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-observatory which still looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru-telescope and the IRTTF.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Also on the Mauna Kea a new, gigantic telescope is supposed to arise - with a mirror average of thirty meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">Here it is to be marveled at on an illustration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">The space telescope Hubble supplies the most important impressions from the space, however.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since the 24th April 1990 it supplies already pictures from far worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009 the space telescope searches Kepler to extrasolar planets - above all after such that are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">On 2nd February 2011 it was announced by the Nasa that 1235 planetary candidates were traced since mission beginning.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the picture the last start preparations are documented to Kepler at the space telescope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is fired into the space in at the earliest 2018 on board a Ariane5-missile.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: It is supposed to search to light of the first stars and galaxies according to the Urknall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume that also at the South Pole of the Mercury ice exists.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there are not for that any dependable data since the Messenger circles far nearer at the North Pole around the planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements have been indicating for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Through the Messenger-Sonde started in 2004 - the first to circle around the Mercury - the scientists have certainty now.</seg>

<seg id="5">In the south of Azerbaijan many people achieve a biblicalally high age.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is even a museum of longevity.</seg>
<seg id="7">A tracing in the country, in which 97-year still comparably young are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The journey through the Talysch-mountains is to be called game-romantic.</seg>
<seg id="9">The minibus rumbles over the street full of bends, past at thickly wooded hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Everything is green and juicy, one could think one was in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">However that here the deepest south of Azerbaijan is, the border to Iran is only few kilometers away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyschen lives from which much is not known unless she speaks Persian as well as Aserisch perfectly and is very long-lasting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Terminal is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">The small small town shows off with too wuchtig guessed architecture from Soviet times that does not want to fit so at all in the picturesque mountain landscape.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists from Europe do not come hardly here, the journey of Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="16">One needs eight hours for the 323 kilometers because the street is only one lane.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fabulous fortune which the country owes to his oil in the Caspian Sea did not arrive here in the province yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced from that of Lerik having the stuff to the tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku became in May famous with the Eurovision song festival - and in the next year we have a festival of the oldest people of the world here," Fatulayeva says".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">She is the directress of the museum of longevity, presumably the only one on the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area that shows in an older way than 100th Fatulayeva onto a black on white photo.</seg>
<seg id="22">That here my grandfather is, he became 120 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the age of 136 years another child testified</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, the sheep herdsman Şirali Müslümov who is supposed to have become 168 years old is a controversial star of the museum.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is not a birth certificate, however.</seg>
<seg id="26">And nevertheless faced with the oldest documented human being to become 122 years old Müslümovs old man appears extremely doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="27">"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died", Fatulayeva explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years he is supposed to have fathered another daughter.</seg>
<seg id="29">Did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate therefore with the case of his age around a few decades?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max-Planck-institute in Rostock, belonged from the aged ones in Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Becoming noticeable many hochaltrige people gives it also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," Scholz says "also in Sardinia many very old men live extremely".</seg>
<seg id="32">Because of missing documents no scientific proof is to be led, however, about the age especially as registers of births marriages and deaths were missing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Every day of cup-wise melted butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Fact is, however, that the people of the region achieve a biblical age strikingly frequently around Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the time of it gives 20 persons that are older than 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why live therefore here in the south so much aged?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.</seg>
<seg id="38">Museum directress Fatulayeva believes, that it is due to the feeding.</seg>
<seg id="39">However that the calorie-rich food is just supposed to be so healthy to the Talyschen that meat, bread and particularly milk products love and from which many drink daily a glass of melted butter, does just not seem plausible either from feeding-scientific view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or is it the initial way of life which holds the people in a young way? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement close to the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.</seg>
<seg id="41">With their 97 years it is still comparably young for these widths.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva who says to have 143 descendants lives in a simple wooden house which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is on the ground with a churn, that they tireless hin- und her rollt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live here under a roof, under that one of Mirzayevas Söhnen and a daughter, both are for a long time grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also two small children jump around.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen one prepares tea which is served in the typical, stomach-shaped Armadu-glasses for the guests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Mirzayevas white teeth stand perfectly in Reih and link, under their head scarf she hides long, dark-blond plaits which their son reveals proudly before us.</seg>
<seg id="48">I always washed my hairs with milk, so I never ran out of them and they kept their color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I have also never used shampoo", says Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Monthly pension suffices for the life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">She always ate only what came from their own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">My whole life long I did not buy food an only time in the supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then it tells about their husband who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">It was worst in the time after the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nevertheless everything became better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the oar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The propaganda rings strangely from the mouth of an old woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nevertheless the cult which is driven around the father figure of the nation which ruled over his country as a dictator does not know hardly borders in Azerbaijan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">To 2003 it was at the power, later his son Ilham took over the oar.</seg>
<seg id="59">After all there is not any need among Azerbaijan's old people.</seg>
<seg id="60">230 manats (about instance the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as pension, for local relations an amount which one can live from well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And maybe also Mirzayevas son for a long time turned gray is right: "The old people enjoy respect in our culture."</seg>
<seg id="62">You live among the major family, love, worries and are happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">If that is not a reason to stay for so long at the life as possibly</seg>

<seg id="4">The future constitution with the sharia as a basis is hard controversial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Egyptian president did not economize on pathos.</seg>
<seg id="6">We must create the crossing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"And that it succeeds, suits in my responsibility, before the nation and before God", he said in the state television.</seg>
<seg id="8">His speech was directed onto the whole nation, particularly, however, presumably onto the Christian Copts, the liberals, cleared up Muslims and Secular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Because they alle, up to now hopelessly zerstritten in a confused opposition, are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fear of a God state at the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has, so Mohammed Mursi, that competences of the constitution court in a temporary way circumcized and that broadens his competences, said almost apologetically "in order to save the revolution".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Nevertheless what the 61-year old engineer really wants to save that takes a doctorate of the American university from south californiums, the Egyptians are about that, the world does completely not realize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Is the judicial power supposed to be entmachtet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In fact the 234 articles that were rushed through by the 100-headed Constitution-Giving meeting in an Islamic way dominated there in a nocturnal, 15-hour ride at full speed are partial concern exciting.</seg>
<seg id="15">As in former constitutions also it is said in the draft the jurisdiction is based on the "principle of Islamic right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, what are "principles" called?</seg>
<seg id="17">That was and is interpretation thing and it stands to fear that the Islamisten will use the spongy formulation and the accompanying juridical elbow room for a more severe interpretation of the sharia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At least an again led article suggests that: In all matters affecting the sharia the Al-Ashar-Universität must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great ray strength into the entire sunnitischen Islam.</seg>
<seg id="19">That must not, however it can mean that the clergy supervise the legislation which would result the Entmündigung of the judicial power in the consequence de facto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Many things in the Verfassunsgsentwurf are interpretation thing</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction is supposed to keep on keeping on being maintained.</seg>
<seg id="22">These courts were used during Mubaraks domination for the suppression of oppositionist ones.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.</seg>
<seg id="24">The state should also, it stands like this in the draft", "the true being of the Egyptian family" protect "and their morality and their values support".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">That is juridically so blurredly formulated, that state institutions with the aid of this article could control even the contents of film art and literature.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the plain text that does not mean anything else than censorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">No article after all the way the equalization of men and women stipulates expressly.</seg>
<seg id="28">For that another forbids to offend or to slander the prophet Mohammed and his envoys.</seg>
<seg id="29">What, however, an insult is and remains as it is supposed to be avenged, unclear.</seg>
<seg id="30">Just as dubiously the formulation seems, the "insult of people" is prohibited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Does already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a jurisconsult reach there?</seg>
<seg id="32">Interpretation thing, as so many things in the draft which there is for Mursi for the signature and which will be presented to "very soon" the Egyptians for the plebiscite according to his words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution returned"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The opposition is forming for weeks against the predominance of the Islamisten.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tens of thousands met in new harmony at the Friday evening on the Tahrir-place in Cairo and still vowed to bring the charter to case before it can come into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution returned and we will triumph", said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the premiership choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Friedensnobelpreisträger and ex-head-boss-chief of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei declared the constitution draft belongs "onto the garbage mountain of the history".</seg>
<seg id="38">Via brief news item service Twitter he accused the supporters Mursis, to want to lead a "coup d'etat against the democracy".</seg>
<seg id="39">"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and fling it", said the Oppositionelle Jasser Said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not atoned for yet", the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.</seg>
<seg id="41">And several judges announced not to want to control the referendum through which it would become invalid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our constitution"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The well organized Muslim brotherhood sounded the counter-demonstration for her part their part, as a precaution, however, not on the Tahrir place, but according to a mass prayer on the other Nile shore in front of the Kairoer university.</seg>
<seg id="44">Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafisten participated in that and called: "The nation demands the application of God's law."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">You demanded from Mursi: "The country cleans"! and declared: "The Koran is our constitution."</seg>
<seg id="46">A fight for the sovereignty about the symbol-pregnant Tahrir-place on which everything took his beginning would have caused presumably civil war similar states.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mursis supporters did not want to risk that very obviously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Muslim brothers declared both the opponents of the constitution draft and the proponents would have been expressed clearly.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now the time is to make the nation at the ballot box be decided into which direction the country is supposed to go.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the smelliest fish of the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and that not only in Europe, but on the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Could putting something with the local appetite onto quite smelly fish have the success secret of the country?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">One takes a selection of overripe cheese sorts.</seg>
<seg id="5">One seats her among a heap of dirty, moist sportswear.</seg>
<seg id="6">And she leaves a week there.</seg>
<seg id="7">So approximately one must imagine the nose-deadening odor of Rakfisk, one of the big delicacies of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small city of Fagernes, removed by Oslo about three hours.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is here snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn odor in the air that does simply not want to disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is trout strewed salt on, that - dependent on that, how being fed up one would have his fish gladly - up to a year in water is fermented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">If into Norway the darkness about the country comes and the weather becomes colder, Norwegians for a celebration flow here into Fagernes, that this is dedicated, now, really very bribing specialty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"One eats it rawly and rinses it then with a glass of Aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but organizes also the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-general".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Consume around us around people small fish dies and tall amounts take for this purpose onto alcohol to themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Like sludges people the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk", Havard says.</seg>
<seg id="15">The spirit can replace the odor.</seg>
<seg id="16">I taste some morsels.</seg>
<seg id="17">If one avoids to bring the Rakfisk into nose proximity, it is not bad - about instance as sushi that has a quite long bus journey behind themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different, by far poorer Norwegian epoch than there were not yet any cool possibilities and fish was soaked in the fall in airtight salt water barrels.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the deepest winter it was arrogated then after long Fermentierung and - beyond doubt under senses subdued with the aid of alcohol - is consumed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Still before a generation thousands of Norwegians were seen forced in search of work, to leave their country and emigrated mainly to the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Today the population increases rapidly - more than 13% are, attracted from a flourishing labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health service, to immigrant.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even from Sweden, the old rival, that was before not yet far too long time by far richer as Norway, immigrants flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is regarded as something important - than an essential, when part of the Norwegian history smelling also severely.</seg>
<seg id="24">He belongs to the more expensive courts which one can buy for oneself here.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not get it often into the world press, and most people seems to disturb that not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here one hates still to name Anders Breivik with the case of the name - that racist right extremist that shot 77 men, women and children to death last year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead of this one refers only to the "incident of the 22nd July".</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegians are for themselves heavily with accepting that somebody is capable in their peace-loving country for such brutal murders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The growth of one of the greatest oil and gas industries of the world is Head-Responsible for the present fortune of Norway since the early 1970th years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"The only reason is not Aber oil why we are so fine", Anna, our waitress, says the distributed round trays with ripe Rakfisk and embodied with their long fair hair and the prickingly blue eyes the Nordic ideal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are - how one says - circumspect nation.</seg>
<seg id="33">Your English is exactly here immaculate as that of most people.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are not very boastful, we do not like any pomposity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway dealt with his oil fortune very cautiously - a big part of the branch profits is invested in a special fund for the welfare of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When in the years up to the world economy crisis all with money around themselves that they did not own at all flung, Norway held his purse shut.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can ski in the winter and go in the summer rambling, we are happy", says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And, she adds "to eat Rakfisk of course" with care free laughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I stand in the snow and act for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">Such an Elch-Burger is in any case something else. I like the juicy meat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But at the evening the being fed up fish stands again on the food plan.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel at which I stay is one of several places of event which organize a Rakfisk-dinner in the case of which guests can vote for the best - or provoking maybe the senses of smell most strongly - fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a Live-TV-circuit to a show master covered with fly which is surrounded from plates with Rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="44">The racket resembles the Eurovision song Contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Which dot number you have there above in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here our points, Havard, are".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">One claps and laughs.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed from the Aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">However, maybe it is nevertheless the severe haze of the whole fish.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing himself for his assumption of office, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges awaiting him and the mixed feelings of his nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The traffic is completely current especially in Mexico City bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even on better days this is an always blocked city, however, on Monday a ring of steel which shuts off several important traffic routes into the capital and guarantees for chaos on the streets was established.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It was not the objective, however, to disturb commuters on the way to the work but to hinder demonstrators at reaching the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the president bandage and take the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It stands before a complex task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Under the parting government Felipe Calderons Mexico had been able to persist economically well, however, the country is in the grip of a drug war which cost already 60,000 human lives in the last six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government commits itself strongly to reducing the power", declared Pena Nieto the US American president Barack Obama at the beginning of this week in the oval Office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will suggest a new security strategy with which we can reach this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before it went onto eye level with the US president, Pena Nieto was active as a governor of his home state Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this thickly settled, detailed part of the country which surrounds the capital the opinions are divided about the new head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A direct man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the faraway small town Valle del Bravo one remembers it for example gladly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Inhabitants of the vacation place ascribe the development of the tourism and the construction of the infrastructure to him.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to reach the city, one can go on one of the motorways that made build Pena Nieto and represents the one great improvement opposite the fragile, bumpy streets that there was here once.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hanging plaques with his name also outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for the climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect real and continuous changes of it", so his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, that as a congress representative for the party of Pena Nietos, who PRI works.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular, what concerns the security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years at the power the PRI was dissolved in the year 2000 by Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">The congress representative Olvera admits that the party puts great expectations from Los Pinos after 12 years outside of the president palace at Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">He refuses the reproaches of the opposition the new president lacks substance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He is a very direct man, very much engages and has big plans for the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is an excellent statesman, particularly he is, however, also somebody who can listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other page of the state many people do not divide this opinion about their former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also confessed as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.</seg>
<seg id="27">The place is hidden under motorway transfers and represents a suburb of Mexico City itself in many kinds of respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the municipality are from decisively urbaner nature.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the beginning of this year the military was called in in order to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and an especially acute problem is violence against women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On a spot fallow near a big dump the corpses of dutzender murdered women were let only in the last two years back.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the term of office of governor Pena Nieto more than 1,000 women were murdered in the Mexico state - a statistics that surpasses even the one of the city of Ciudad Juarez that is notorious for their power and the murders of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The critics Pena Nietos think that he did not approach the problem of the woman murders adequately during his term of office at least.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, in the worst case his government shut their eyes to the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete construction, typical for the quarter come down, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when it shows me photos of their late daughter Mariana Luna.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the official version of the events Mariana committed in 2010 suicide.</seg>
<seg id="36">Nevertheless their family believes that she was murdered by their companion in life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived at her at home, it seemed" remembered to Senora Buendia "as if their body was washed".</seg>
<seg id="38">It gave to signs that it was beaten, and the rigor mortis had already started.</seg>

<seg id="1">The prosecution claimed: Bradley Manning did not complain about maltreatment</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The prosecution contradicts Bradley Mannings reproaches he was maltreated in the prison</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The defense strives for a rejection of the accusation due to too hard custody conditions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The private first class of the US army is reproached to have stolen thousands of confidential documents</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The prosecution attempted on Friday to state that the army private first class Bradley Manning - accused for the greatest disclosure of confidential information of the US American history - missed several occasions to complain about the maltreatment supposedly suffered by him in military custody.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With the case of a cross-examinaton of Mannings during a vorgerichtlichen hearing in Ft. Meade, Maj declared to Maryland. Ashden Fein, that documents to weekly visits, that prison officials during Mannings of nine month long custody time in Quantico had carried out, Virginia, no complaints about his treatment showed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Manning had stated a day in front of the cross-examinaton that was kept off due to a request of the defense for the rejection of the accusation - Manning was punished through the hard custody time already sufficiently -, he would have considered that one in the prison suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">To the secret service analyst the US army that was arrested in June 2010 is reproached to have stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="10">The material was published then by WikiLeaks in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as sources of the information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In the hearing on Friday passed with Manning the forms, the Beamte after their meetings with Manning during his custody in the Quantico military prison had filled, where it had of July 2010 to April 2011 under increasing custody conditions resident.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The officials set Manning questions and wrote down his answers.</seg>
<seg id="14">When refine it on Friday to the forms questioned, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment as "very professional" in total through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment through the equipment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms, so refine, no complaints contained about maltreatment although the officials Manning directly for his treatment had consulted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning answered, it expressed his objections verbally and the officials would have cured these with him and would have declared to deal with these. They were not taken down, however.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"You did not write down (after discussion of the objections) Any problems, and that did not mean necessarily that I said nothing at all" so Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The judge, colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met in January 2011 a committee which should examine the suicide thoughts mentioned by him some months before on a form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning answered, his intention during this meeting consisted in making step his observation status for the "prevention of injuries".</seg>
<seg id="20">The military testified, assigned this restrictive status - that a stage stands under the suicide danger - to his and the protection of others to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted to convince employees of my being fine, and rid myself of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) being able to achieve about a living quality higher from my view" said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning testified on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where it was held approximately two months, before it was moved to the prison of the marine basis Quantico in July 2010 in Virginia.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="23">He said in Kuwait he considered the suicide and became once unconscious due to the heat.</seg>
<seg id="24">Not to be allowed to know what with it or in the outside world happens was burdening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world shrank on camp Arafjon, onto this cage", Manning said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">I thought I would die in this cage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">When it was brought out according to Quantico, Manning spent the majority of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.</seg>
<seg id="28">One allowed him only a mattress, a cover, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">Manning said he attempted to stay in motion, because on day it was prohibited to sleep or only also to lie down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Always he had had to sleep with light which penetrated his cell from outside.</seg>
<seg id="31">If it turned itself round at night and guards could not see his face anymore, one woke him up so that he turns himself down again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In January 2011 Mannings attorney raised formally objection against the treatment Mannings.</seg>
<seg id="33">In April 2011 Manning into the military prison of fort Leavenworth became, Kansas brings out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On Friday the judge Manning also for an accusation that it had raised in his statement on Thursday consulted - so he had had to sleep a night nakedly in his cell in Quantico and stand with the case of a morgendlichen counting nakedly before guards and other prisoners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning had stated he has never had during this counting the occasion to cover oneself with his cover.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the questioning on Friday Manning indicated he concluded from a command of his guard that he should make the cover which it could have covered itself with fall. He admitted, however, that nobody had called him for that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On Thursday Manning had stated that he was forced in the previous night to sleep nakedly. He would have attempted before to show an official that it does not represent any danger for itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning said to the official, he could have used the Federal Government of his pants or his flip-flops in order to hurt oneself, does this, however.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In this night, so Manning testified, his pants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">His attorneys hope for the judge considering his custody experiences at least and reducing his custody measure drastically, if he should be condemned during his negotiations in front of the military court. This is applied for beginning of next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defense served, that Manning will confess smaller offenses' for guilty, while other charges that are regarded as too extreme are being supposed to be contested.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. A justification of the custody conditions is expected by the prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="43">The pentagon remains with the case of his position, that according to Manning the regulations' was hung on, that are valid for all prisoners verwahrten under the highest safety measures in Quantico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">To the charges against Manning belong the preferential treatment of the enemy, illegal publication of secret-official information in the Internet, the transfer of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He becomes in all charges for guiltily been, a lifelong prison sentence threatens it.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My Mexican-American identity crisis.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Many people are due to the missing chances forced to leave Mexico</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to accusing the emigrants - hard times call it to them into the memory, he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette thinks that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent journey to Mexico City I had just crossed first the hall and had arrived at the passport check when desperation spread in me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood some seconds long there, unsure to which one I should go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central californiums and my whole life was mentioned long "Mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">An ethnic abbreviation - just the same, as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian" name themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I decided for "Mexikanisch-Amerikanisch".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">However that was here Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the home of my grandfather there was not any need to abbreviations or hyphens.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simple only American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish, at least good enough, in order to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I do also not rid myself of my American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Therefore I took my American passport and positioned myself into the snake for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about that moment of this week, when the future Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto went to the White House, in order to meet president Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda all those topics which one expects stood if the heads of these two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It was interested to Pena Nieto also very much at that to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans staying nowadays in Mexico with just as high probability instead of emigrating to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would like to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American commercial block according to model of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels even if he did not name any details concerning that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mexico's relation to the United States is complicated and full resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans never waste presumably an only thought of the United States collapsing into Mexico in the year 1848 and forcing the leadership of the country under rifle held up to leaving more to them than half of their territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes memories of this event are not to be overlooked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As soon as therefore a US Regierungsbeamter practices also only mildest criticism at Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints besetting the sovereignty of their neighbor country as the Americans about that.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children Montezumas go onto the warpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And nevertheless the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth suits to Mexican Americans who live in the United States in the relationship with the more than 35 million.</seg>
<seg id="28">Inclination to talk about resentments?</seg>
<seg id="29">There is more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has winner and loser. People who the country offers chances for, and others which it does not do this for.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason, why as many people of Mexican origin in cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, phoenix, Denver or San Antonio live, exists in at a point in our pedigree a person - maybe a parent or grandparents part - not getting any chance offered in Mexico and north migrating in the direction.</seg>
<seg id="32">And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, and so forth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are the descendants of these people, and our faith is meant for them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And although we live the American dream maybe now, have attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose from the eyes, that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican one.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity became blurred sometimes possibly, but what concerns our loyalty, is not this the case.</seg>
<seg id="37">This means for the United States unequivocally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition we are conscious that many members of the Mexican leadership shift do not like us to ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="39">This is based on mutuality.</seg>
<seg id="40">You see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look on us because we are not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish is never never good enough our bands to Mexico strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">In your opinion our existence is a symbol of the failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And then we would not see ourselves now caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, however, nevertheless somehow lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife that was born in Guadalajara and immigrated to the United States as a child legally reminds me of between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions existing because Mexicans have a clearer idea above that who they are - and Mexican Americans are offended this at them.</seg>
<seg id="46">While she is being a US American citizen, she sees herself as a part of two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Nevertheless many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling on the one hand yet neither not to belong to the other country.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">One enjoys the best thing of both worlds, nevertheless did not root in any of them.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we are seen as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">As I should learn during my journey, there is something, which makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leadership persons and parts of the education bourgeoisie would like to resume their connections to the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" who represent their interests in the United States want to use them for Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="54">We are supposed to tell our American colleagues about that, as fabulously a visit of this country is and pressure on the political leadership exert, to intensify their links to Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Now.</seg>
<seg id="56">That will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hurt feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And faced with the unfair income distribution, the unrestrained corruption and the drug power many of us are not so secure at all, whether it is really a question of a fabulous country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I fear, there must their only through, Amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">That is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the contact with Mexico one and a half centuries ago yet, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for that as their member of the family only before not at all so long time were treated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe we are "more Mexican" than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old combats, new Near east</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could prove to be unexpected keystone for the peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can there be ever continuous peace between Arabs and Jews in the Near East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The newest bloody events seem such hope in the germ to suffocate.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the usual fault assignments countless buildings were put into debris and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, civilians, and six Israelis killed most from that - and for the first time missiles struck from Gaza near the Israeli Tel Aviv metropolis and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historical conflict, the Near east changes around them around.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arabian spring created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis became part of these disorders.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe this will lead only to more bloodsheds.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons for the assumption that the fatal stalemate situation could find their end at last.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war, which neither did not lose still is won</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first sight optimism seems all but made faced with the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if that one agreed on 21st November armistice stops, the dieswöchigen fights fortified the hard-boiled ones on both pages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The chiefs of the Hamas, the Islamic movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will say from themselves to have pushed the Israelis back although his grouping itself had to record great losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although several Hamas-Führer are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip penned in in one of the corners of the planet most desolate and thickly most populated, Israel did not succeed until now in destroying the Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact the Hamas wins in the West Bank, that of the rival one, moderate Palestinian group Fatah is controlled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">And that to Hamas-Führer could come to the end, that they have the time on their page.</seg>
<seg id="17">The way Islamisten gained influence in the Arabian world the Hamas had been able to pull powerful and rich friends onto their page.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a power being strengthened again, regional that once was regarded as Israel's narrowest Muslim ally took for the Hamas party - exactly as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf State.</seg>
<seg id="19">Jubilant Hamas-Anhänger believe that an Islamic half-moon forms itself around Israel - of Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has the power, above Syria, where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren coining could be before the Stürzung Bashar Assads, up to Jordan, where Hamas-Verbündete threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And in particular the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under president Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the Arabian country inhabitant-strongest with distance and most important - at the southern flank of Israel changed the balance of the region lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the laizistische despot that ruled over Egypt up to his fall 2011 for 30 years had only little time for the Hamas remaining.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast the brotherhood is verschwägert with the Hamas and their chiefs stronger dependent on nation opinions.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the case of future diplomatic negotiations the Hamas could prove to be protagonist that cannot be herausgedrängt even by Israel and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">On the other hand let to the Israeli hardliners draw an opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Hamas is seen military no danger anymore.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", had been able to persist and many of the Hamas-Raketen were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">At least a while long Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic respect the United States hold on unshakeably to their position. Many European countries made the Hamas responsible for the newest power escalations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Israel did well in last years, in particular under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu who ignored the peace process to big parts.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although missiles killed about 30 Israelis from the Gaza stripe since 2004, the country remained relative freely from suicide assassins - last but not least thanks to the blocking-installations, that run into the West Bank and in this way into the main part of a possible Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements which were declared indeed as international law adverse, yet are extended always further.</seg>
<seg id="31">Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud-party allied with an even more combative group in the front end of the choices on the 22nd January under Avigdor Lieberman.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why also these crafty Palestinians pamper and leave an own state with them?</seg>
<seg id="33">If in fact they had the control of the West Bank, they would not fire off then also missiles exactly as their combatants in the Gaza Strip?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, it is better, to hold behind the wall in chess and to punish they, they should dare to lift the heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Maybe the hardliners will be able to assert. Nevertheless the Arabian spring could make them a line through the bill.</seg>
<seg id="36">Self when the Islamisten that now are in Egypt and in other countries at the power have little remaining for Israel, they will concentrate first of all on the difficulties in the own country.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defense appropriation of Israel is greater together than that of his four Arabian neighbors is.</seg>
<seg id="38">A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arabian governments during the repair of their economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">That the pragmatic president Mursi put together with Barack Obama in order to achieve an armistice could be a promising sign - and symbolize maybe the beginning of a new era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also Israelis should think more on a long-term basis.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the remaining Arabian world is doing timid steps in the direction of democratization, Palestinians keep on being robbed of their self-determination right - a powder keg that will explode beyond doubt one day in the in an Israeli manner busy fields exactly as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">The suppression untergräbt already now the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arabian population this situation will only intensify.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bloody missions to the Zurückdrängung of the Hamas in the Gaza-stripe will require their diplomatic toll increasingly over the years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both pages require an impulse from outside</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The correct answer is that, that of the more reasonable representatives of both pages, the majority of the remaining world and of this newspaper will represent: Two states near which Israel to security purposes hands over fields.</seg>
<seg id="46">The - for the near future small - hope consists in the armistice giving external more influence for the enforcement of this solution.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt must stop now the arm deliveries together with Turkey and Qatar in the Gaza patrols and is better positioned than ever before, around the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on basis of the borders of 1967, complemented with field exchange and a common Jerusalem, to convince.</seg>
<seg id="48">External Arabian nations should convince also the Hamas and Fatah of an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="49">In this way would be done for the creation of a Palestinian state more than with the imminent request for UN observer statuses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Also Obama must contribute his part to convincing Israel of negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term of office he missed the idea of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems far remote in the White House as if it were averse to a participation in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="53">However, that is a regrettable, shortsighted perspective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States have an essential interest at a stable Near east.</seg>
<seg id="55">And a peace agreement belongs to that between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Australian laws for homogeneous cigarette packagings come into force</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Health warnings and sick parts of the body on neutral green packages that are identical for all tobacco brands</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The worldwide first laws came for homogeneous cigarette and tobacco packagings into force in Australia. In this way brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive-green lids that in addition are printed with drastic pictures that show sick parts of the body and babies sick through cigarette smoke and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">From the different health warnings and pictures once foreseen the only difference consists from coming Saturday between the packages in the brand names that are printed in identical, small writing.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this way Australia introduces the worldwide most severe regulations for tobacco packagings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian Federal Government wants to talk out young people of the smoking when the glamorous picture of the tobacco consumption is removed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government takes as a basis studies that showed that people, that with 26 still not have started smoking with 99%-iger probability also after that no more will begin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"One can see already with children of young age that they understand the message the tobacco company groups with their brand picture apply attempt", according to federal minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies which for example showed that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Although Australia shows one of the least smoker rates of the world and the changes will affect the profits of the multinational company groups only insignificantly, other countries consider already similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco lobby fought in a hard way against the laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">So it was said with the laws the black market trade would be favored, what too cheaper and easy accessible cigarettes leads.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chinese and Indonesian forgers will offer by far greater amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Say others on the other hand that the laws stimulated their business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, says, that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to the covering of the intolerable packagings have gone up enormous, since the company groups British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the uppermost Australian court of justice failed with their contestation of the laws.</seg>
<seg id="16">Zico sold wholesale businesses up to 6,000 units and waits for new supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us that is a good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to experts the hook is in the popularity of social media near exactly the population group which the plan consults.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tabakkonzerne banished a series of Australian laws from the TV advertising, forbidden it to them, as sport sponsors occur and most traders in order not to design cigarettes longer in businesses forced. Now the tobacco advertising is changed into the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government forbade internet advertising through local enterprises and pages, does not have, however, any influence on international pages.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Who commercializes tobacco and has only a small field remaining, to apply around his products, does not get about around the Internet", Becky Freeman, researcher, says in the health service at the Sydney university.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On social media as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman found a rise at field reports to brands that were written by "very normal people".</seg>
<seg id="23">One must ask oneself the question: That is only a private person that thinks so great favor of Marlboro cigarettes that she receives even a video for that - or a marketing agency in this way has to do?</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a constantly electrified world it is beautiful to be also once bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours in the airport, than our airplane due to mechanical problems turned out and we had to wait for another airman.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had therefore enough time in order to do me a few thoughts to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I do not want to lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">To wait for a flight half a day at the airport is quite nerve-killing - self, if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However always more academics and child development experts mention boredom than something positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">If it works after them, it is okay for us - and our child - to be sometimes bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way the brain is forced to be lost in interesting trains of thought which supports the creativity possibly.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because most of us nowadays almost constant onto that one one or stare other screen, the advantages of the boredom do not benefit us anymore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Should we welcome the boredom therefore with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">I come to that once again back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">As many people also I assumed always boredom being a relatively current phenomenon which developed with advancing leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and roman history at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that like this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact the boredom has a very long history", he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">A roman graffiti above boredom which goes back to the first century adorns the house walls Pompejis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then still the question is there how we define boredom actually.</seg>
<seg id="19">John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of the psychology at the university York in Ontario, according to Canada the problem consists in boredom defining in all sorts of ways and being discussed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 persons professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion came, that boredom as the experience, "to want to carry out a satisfactory activity, this, however, not can" can define.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom is distinguished from apathy accordingly in such a way that the person is not busy, would like to be this, however.</seg>
<seg id="22">With the case of the apathy on the other hand it gives no urge, to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He says, the key experience of the boredom, consists in a "trouble of the attention process, combined with bad mood and the feeling that the time goes by only slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can almost sound in this way so as depression can.</seg>
<seg id="25">But professor Eastwood believes, although these two states could be related, bored persons see the problem in their surroundings or the world while depressive persons are seeing the problem in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we believe that concentrating is boring to us even if we only have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in term of Attention "- to German about instance: "The inactive intelligence: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention", which appeared in September in the technical journal paper "Perspectives on Psychological Science", professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to a former experiment there, with the participant a volume listened, on which a person read out a magazine article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard a loud channel program from the adjacent room which doing did not have anything with the contents. Others heard it on low volume so that it was hardly perceptible while the third group was not vernahm these noises at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The persons that did not vernahmen the hardly audible television declared to verspüren more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could not find any reason for these and ascribed their difficulties to the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If one attempts to concentrate on a difficult or hard task, the trouble of the attention can lead to boredom, says J. Fenske, associated professor for neurosciences at the university Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study, to marks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">When one on the other hand a monotonous activity carried out - "so as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can turn away and help with not "feeling" bored".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Actual, so he says, we know now, that these can even oppose Herumzappeln and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign for boredom, when persons remain physically more attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Studies showed, that learn children that may jump about more and keep more information than those ones that are forced to the Stillsitzen" so professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">To us all becomes sometime once boring - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, an especially tiring film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some persons are bored more easily than others are.</seg>
<seg id="36">In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980th years a "scale into the boredom delicateness".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On the scale statements as "Many things that I must do" are found "repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the aid of such scales researchers found out that to boys becomes more often boring than girls so Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the west Florida university - in particular, what affects the need according to more and a greater variety of external charms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, in general teenagers are a quite measured heap.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reed Larson carried on in the year 1991, professor for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment, at which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times on the day with a beeper.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found the way out, that 32% the watching-sending in the school and while finishing the homework were bored, wohingegen 23% indicated, bored to be if they were not in the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">However only 3% of the parents declared to feel bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages increased with regard to the boredom or sank.</seg>
<seg id="44">He is, however, secure that the youth is felt as especially boring, main, because children and teenagers do not have any great influence on their everyday life course.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Back therefore for my origin question: Is boredom healthy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because at the very most it leads to that that people take extreme physical risks onto themselves and succumb to the gambling or to drugs in order to ease it - studies showed that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion professor Vodanovich that is investigating the topic for more than two decades is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"With the boredom it wants to tell one the brain that one should do something else", according to Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the New York university.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not know always, what one should just do best.</seg>
<seg id="50">When one boring is and used one this energy in order to play Gitarre and to cook, one becomes happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, television can guarantee at short notice indeed for happiness, these evaporate on a long-term basis but again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It can talk out who gives an iPad to his bored child therefore indeed of the boredom in this way. It has in this way yet not learned to maintain or to control oneself, professor Fenske says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And he adds: "Self-control spreads from a situation to the other one".</seg>
<seg id="54">The child does only not learn to talk, but he receives more self-control also in other fields.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also we should not see it too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead of this our objective should consist in feeling well also off the constant activity and technology irrigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees to that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"It rings as if have to be to us more often boring. But boredom is the tormenting, incessant wish, to do something reasonable", it says.</seg>
<seg id="60">He believes that the people in truth seek only to a way to switch off and to relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In some surroundings in which we are stimulated constantly it is difficult to occupy oneself if the noise has stopped once."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Colorado there is not any clear guideline for the new marihuana law</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The 19-year old Community College-Student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorados for an offense that will already soon be legal in this state in court court: The possession of of a few marihuana pieces and a whistle with which it smoked these.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">According to Orozco it and some friends were on a September day by car, when they were stopped, in Lamar near the border to Kansas on the way.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officer had found marihuana in the car, Orozco was summonsed for the possession from drugs and drug utensils - peccadillos which are equipped with a punishment of 100 United States dollars in each case - and received a court hearing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We" are "treated" as criminals", according to Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But is he also one?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts marihuana for the own use to legalize, the answer shakes off less of the law at hundreds of smaller drug offenses, than from the location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of infractions of the law that turn around marihuana become Washington here and in the state, who approved similar measures, already trap-calm.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police do not follow adults because of possession longer over 21 years in small measure. This is allowed by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados announced, to weiterverfolgen existing marihuana offenses and people summon still in court court.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time several cities vote, from the suburbs of Denver above to the western Mountains above that, to hinder licensed new, state marihuana businesses at the opening in their municipalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This situation develops so quickly that I do not know at all what will happen as next", Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, says that lies east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">And also regulation authorities in the Washington Federal state scratch themselves helplessly at the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">You wait for a guideline to the equipment of a license system for the production, production, the marketing and the sale of the drug - and have in this case a period of time up to the 1st December 2013 in front of eyes.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Washington one thinks that Colorado is ahead of most states in every case what affects the regulation of marihuana. There the drug first to medical purposes and then for the own consumption was legalized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more strongly adjusted market. The state is suitable for the orientation well therefore", says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the inspectorate, for spirits in the Washington state.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to be used in the sense of a coarse guide.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We do not have any real precedent which we can follow" he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, mentionedly I-502, comes into force on 6th December and forms in this way also the endpoint of a grey zone in which indeed yet the state license system does not exist, but the possession is legalized.</seg>
<seg id="20">And unpleasant practice questions must be clarified in this time - about instance, as the state handicap of an "adequate access" to licensed marihuana with the prohibition of cannabis businesses within a radius of 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities is supposed to be agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Nowhere it will not be heavier, to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in town areas, in particular in the conurbation of Seattle", Ben Livingston, speaker for the "center for Legal of Cannabis", means a recently formed team of researchers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21st November Chief Oates sent his employees an E-Mail in which it declared the public prosecutor would not pursue smaller marihuana offenses longer with persons above 21 years into Aurora and that the police "immediately now on" will not strive for any charges for these offenses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates added that the police will keep on putting through urban handicaps for the regulation of peasants of medical marihuana and drug traders would keep on being followed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County in the north Colorados district public prosecutor Ken Buck represents a more severe opinion.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote it indicated his authority would keep on pursuing cases of marihuana possession main, in order to move consumers for the revocation.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently 119 persons must justify themselves for the possession of about 50 grams or less marihuana court court although many were accused also for other offenses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our authority pursued the duty violations with the case of which it was" a question "of crimes" to the action time" Buck could be announced in a declaration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions are conflicting even at places as the rural mesa county, where voters refused the marihuana-initiative.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in gravel Junction, the biggest city of the rural district, do not announce adults longer for the possession of smaller amounts.</seg>
<seg id="30">This decision supported district public prosecutor Pete Hautzinger, decided, however, also on that, not fall all outstanding possession procedures to let.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not believe that I waste my time with putting through the right until it is changed", he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55% of the voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was already from the beginning clear that it would not be simple to agree the personal consumption of marihuana with the complexities of government and judicial system.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the inconsistent reactions in the whole state supported a far-reaching conflict among local officials with regard to the great green experiment to light.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">With district public prosecutors it is a question of a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver that represents for marihuana offenses defendants standing in court court and acts on site as a speaker for the national organization for the reform of marihuana laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"You transferred a so big part of their life with following persons legally because of their not still being able to accept the legalization", he believes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As first states, Mix the smaller one marihuana as to handle alcohol, Colorado and Washington as national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs are sold.</seg>
<seg id="37">While intercessors and civil servants are preparing themselves for an age of legal sale, they wait simultaneously also nervously for instructions of the Federal Government which keeps on wanting to treat the sale and the building of marihuana on federal level as a crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Intercessors of the legalization movement hope for the Ministry of Justice giving in.</seg>
<seg id="39">In spite of several sensational arrests of consumers and sales assistants of medical marihuana the Federal Government allowed the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Kevin A. Sabet, former drug politics consultant of the Obama government thinks that detectives will probably indeed not kick in any doors, will presumably bristle, in order to confiscate smaller amounts of the drugs, however, to allow the marihuana businesses legal under the new legislation, from a government viewpoint adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several cities in Colorado do not wait first at all for the federal authorities acting.</seg>
<seg id="42">Still before the choice day some local local administrations approved moratoriums for new marihuana-businesses although these could not open before in about instance a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six month long prohibition which is presumably adopted next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We would not like to get into a position with the case of which we license somebody and "stand then on federal level" before a great problem", according to Bob Nicholson, member of the town council councillor.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our municipality voted against this law change.</seg>
<seg id="46">We straighten, for which the municipality decided and not after what the state decided for.</seg>
<seg id="47">Nor many questions are not open.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: I became from Oxford gemobbt because I am a Tory</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only university students of today are attacked for their opinions</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Always it had been my greatest dream to receive a place at the Oxford university.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had attended that university that I held for the biggest knowledge temple of the world once for a modern Greek symposium, that supported the big columns of the civilization - free thinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, within two weeks after my entry in the Worscester college end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had packed again my suitcases and caused so the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed in tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the Evening Standard it was said I would have gone because I had had a problem in this way that fellow students had sex in the adjacent room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author A N Wilson declared mischievously I would have left the university because I was forced to that, to drink from damaged cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth, however, was less amusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ran, because I suffered from systematic Mobbing and threats.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not about instance due to my quite unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">One had harassed me only for a reason - a reason, that in this alleged cradle of the illumination the more narrow-minded and crueler shone: My in the meantime late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important consultant Margaret Thatchers and I proponent of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why mentions I this just now?</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, according to current reports a new generation of students of the moderate ones suffers Dispute under similar pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The organized and increasing hatred for Tory students in Oxford developed in the meantime such dimensions that a group demanded the same equal rights protection from them last week the gays', disabled persons and ethnic minorities benefits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the junior Common Room (JCR) the corpus Christi College serve, they are "often isolated due to their political opinions actively ", personally attacked and declared as unwanted".</seg>
<seg id="19">You demand a place in the equal rights committee of their college in order to guarantee that their opinions can be expressed freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation through a recently broadcast documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland", was Verschlimmert: Young, Bright and on the Right" that represented Tories as Exzentriker and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">In that graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative studentischen union of the Oxford university, who went in a Rolls-Royce and showed off with silvery suit and silver-busy going-stick was shown among other things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities conservative students say they are considered as "Scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".</seg>
<seg id="23">The 20-year long hatch Black, vice-president of the conservative student union of the Nottingham university, made in a Sunday newspaper be reported: "There is a wachsende link tendency at universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people believe, we are as the Bullingdon Club without having become acquainted with us anyway".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in corpus Christi that initiated the request for bigger protection thinks such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative studentischen union of Oxford says, she observed a wachsende refusal with JCR members opposite students of the moderate ones Dispute.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the good health of the members" she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In my first weeks in Oxford I belonged to such a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">When incredibly shy 18-year I was arrived in September 1986.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Hatred for the Conservative Party had reached his climax.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the previous year the university had voted for not giving Margaret Thatcher - a former student - any honorary title due to shortenings in the college being.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would have made even Stalinists be startled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the Erstsemester-week at which new students become acquainted with themselves and the tutors I received a foretaste of the future events.</seg>
<seg id="33">I had the experience, that the tutors did only not tolerate the mocking of Tory students, but participated in that even with joys.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political topics as the miner strike, the denationalization and the refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid-regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="35">At my first of these events I should translate French texts from the 18th century in the English. Onto what then should come, I had not been grabbed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss "you translate the first sale" to Wyatt", the tutor Harry Pitt (in the meantime late) said, "please".</seg>
<seg id="37">I stumbled in this case.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt was a small man with a face as from cake mixture, and quite spiteful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or they are only simple stupid"? he asked to me.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students giggled.</seg>
<seg id="41">In my eyes tears boiled up.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that they take in your leisure time of a few French hours - therefore if you are" not "occupied with your social activities too very much" Pitt growled at me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned with hanging head to my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">At this evening I had the supper in the college alone, than me easily for somebody onto the shoulder bet.</seg>
<seg id="45">An English student was from the second year by the name of James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative studentischen union.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are", he said in a friendly manner.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately it is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="48">To be to everyone that is suspected Tory is bullied.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is already bad enough, but she will know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, therefore it will be worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most Tory-Erstsemester pretend to be supporters of the Labour-party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In a local pub I attempted later to act.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted, that I not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion was.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="54">An university entrant in the compartment of philosophy, politics and economy, that ironischerweise that than conservatively valid Eton College had visited, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".</seg>
<seg id="55">You dirtied.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students divided his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverted and dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"As Tories have sex"? one asked to me.</seg>
<seg id="59">Those ones beat themselves mutually, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt like this as homosexuals had to have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">Would I ever succeed in leading a normal life at the Oxford university?</seg>
<seg id="62">Could I meet like-minded persons only after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">Should I to turn to the Labour-party and to suppress my natural inclinations?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years which lay before me stretched themselves before my intellectual eye for a purgatory of the ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only tutor who gave to recognize oneself as a Tory openly was Norman Stone, professor, for contemporary history which had his seat in my college.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was not hated only for being a conservative but also, because he had advised Thatcher as regards foreign policy and written speeches for them.</seg>
<seg id="67">It was only rarely there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place, found it provincial and small-check and refused it for his Marxist-deterministic history perspective.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 he picked up a professorship at the university Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You will not become happy here", he said to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began, to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and refuge found with friends opened up and member of the family in the city.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father, that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">It seemed unbelieving.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his time in the forties all political opinions were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it is the best place on the world", he said subduedly.</seg>
<seg id="76">They would never do something like that, not in my city of the dreaming steeples.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends put always flawless manners on the day.</seg>
<seg id="78">His moist eyes obscured.</seg>
<seg id="79">Give a chance to the whole.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am secure, one only teases you.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break me the heart if you went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">My emotional resistance was exhausted by my frequent journeys to London more weakly.</seg>
<seg id="83">One of my masculine friends, also Tory-Anhänger, had given in to the pressure and renounced from his convictions.</seg>
<seg id="84">During a tutorial in the following week with the case of which a further history tutor had said seriously I am "an enemy of the nation" I decided on doing the same one.</seg>
<seg id="85">In spite of my overcoming with shame secretly, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwashing", and she named "old idiots".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The relief lasted only shortly.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was my father who beat the last nail into the coffin of my Oxford-career.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time he wrote weekly two columns in the Murdoch-press.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="93">Gladly you can mention me a tearful wimp.</seg>
<seg id="94">But none 18-year should have to suffer ever from such intimidation and evil-mindedness in an educational facility institution.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"Valentino draws elegance of the celebrity before"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of the couture" that was opened this week in London, ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker speaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the single place in the British capital which is worthy of the Beherbergung of an exhibition above Valentino Garavani.</seg>
<seg id="4">The designer during the opening of "Valentino" has this "-" acknowledged "of master of the couture", an overwhelming retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute couture were put together that were created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I love this palace", he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.</seg>
<seg id="6">This exhibition is the end of a history whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani which, however, could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Valentino verspürte always already fascination for the stuffy and far world of the nobility.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the first hall of this exhibition that will be to be seen still up to the 3rd March there is a great number at private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, begun by the princess Salimah Aga khan, about the princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England up to lord Snowdon.</seg>
<seg id="9">Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise of the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To be amorous into the nobility does not have to be from disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="11">"At least they do not stamp out their edges on your marvellous carpet as it some beautiful celebrities put from the pop music", says baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the 60th and 70th years the two lived in the alps and good friends were.</seg>
<seg id="13">Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We all were pleased if we were invited to his house in Gstaad", the exwoman of "Heini" Thyssen declares, in a close way with forgotten beauties as to B. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.</seg>
<seg id="15">Valentino preferred always already the elegance of the celebrity.</seg>
<seg id="16">And nevertheless he is a star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many years ago we went into Rome to it home for the supper according to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna.</seg>
<seg id="20">We were about 20 persons, under that also Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.</seg>
<seg id="21">Recognized by every detail of his apartment, the decoration, at the food and at the music and one sensed his influence.</seg>
<seg id="22">"All invited felt important and loved", the "top model" remembers that began their career at the week of the Haute couture in 1995 in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It never comes from the fashion, because his designs works of art are" she says definitively..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Fashion show of the origin</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The life of Garavani is not a history of keenness, rather of mutual love affairs.</seg>
<seg id="26">He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love it.</seg>
<seg id="27">One of the galleries in Somerset House was changed into a catwalk glorious and 60 meters long which suggests a role exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk in order to admire a marvellous "audience" that takes masterpieces from Valentino how for example the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for their wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti bore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather belonged, the the empress Farah Diba.</seg>
<seg id="28">In this public from dummies names as that one shine from Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saying a lot of of these customers which is first Valentino as the first love, "unforgettable".</seg>
<seg id="31">I can remember still perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="32">It was some trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was a present of it", says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I would accuse him of all other because of his great love for the women and because he emphasizes our beauty, before" the ex-duchess matches from Feria.</seg>
<seg id="35">I like the colors which he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.</seg>
<seg id="36">The proportions are perfect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The first time cannot forget also the princess and opinion guide with the case of the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg when it supported a Valentino.</seg>
<seg id="38">When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed about having the age and the occasion to bear one of his evening dresses at last...</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally at the end of the nineties it was added then.</seg>
<seg id="40">I bought my first Valentino dress for myself for a celebration in the castle of my cousin, that prince Edouard de Ligne.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped upper part with a neckline which does honor to his name.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It was a truly become dream", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless", this Italian aristocrat that lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires explains.</seg>
<seg id="44">The princess D'Arenberg keeps their evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress but also the memories combined with that".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The "king" of the fashion</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for their wedding with Pablo de Grecia in the year 1995.</seg>
<seg id="47">Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker mentioned his sewers) were necessary in order to make this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a tail four and a half meters long.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the uppermost authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the uppermost society".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">For years with that "savoir-être" obscured to the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.</seg>
<seg id="50">Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l 'Orders the Arts et of the Lettres, marked with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors, as each of the husbands of his customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"His well-kept and perfect outside appearance struck me always his cunning, his rest," admits D'Arenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">I saw it the last time a month ago at a gala dress supper in the museum de Orsay.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.</seg>
<seg id="54">"It was immaculate; the time does not leave behind any tracks at it".</seg>
<seg id="55">And a princess says this...</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The most difficult profession of the world: the human sloggers of Kawah Ijen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and their health if they take 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stony ways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom their work is the hell, and others work in a word for word way in the hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn themselves their life who getting sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian Java island.</seg>
<seg id="5">For this purpose it must climb down every day the ground of his crater, where the sulphur-containing gas flowing out of the earth hardens in the contact with the air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After it has lacked big sulphur stones, be able to weigh the up to in total 70 kilos, it transports it over the sloping paths in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders of stone.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is indeed only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that rises until a height from 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle speed, at which they keep the balance and their steps cautious have to put so that they do not slip and fall.</seg>
<seg id="8">You know that every step can cost their life as this of a French tourist who fell before years at the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen passed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulphur which they remove.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Above arrived, they would clear the way between the tourists, that they as circus monkeys photograph and walk with the baskets in a tiring way heavy three kilometers up to the scales that a mine society set up below on a height of 1850 meters a little bit further</seg>
<seg id="11">The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, that since 1960 the occurrences in the volcano uses and (never better said) his workers, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian Rupien (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">She sells that then for each 10,000 Rupien (83 euro cents) onto the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in the everyday life and for the production of matches, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar is used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Since we usually bear 70 kg, we receive for every way of about 46,000 Rupien (3.8 euros)", Anto that normally does three stretches on day declares us.</seg>
<seg id="14">He needs three hours after which it is completely created for every stretch, at the end of the day he has, however, then 138,000 Rupien (11.5 euros) together.</seg>
<seg id="15">What as a miserable wage for one such an almost inhuman effort looks is, however, the triple thing of what he would earn with the work in the fields.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The day's pay of the mine workers here is where with the case of the coffee harvest of 15,000 Rupien (1.2 euros) on day pay and the average month income is two million Rupien (167 euros) very high", the carrier explains that before worked as a bricklayer on the touristischen Bali island.</seg>
<seg id="17">There he earned 75,000 Rupien (6.2 euros) from the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduisten, and I brought it to Java in order to convert it for the Islam".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The 27 yearly Anto puts for three years his life at the Kawah Ijen onto the game, whose sulphur at the it already the first tracks has left behind, although it covers his face with a mask and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price which he must pay for the attaining of his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work here still two years because I would like to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in one more than only acceptable English's.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This young man agreeable and intelligent, but punished from the life could work than tourist leaders, waiter or at the reception of a hotel however instead of this he performs the work of a carrying-donkey.</seg>
<seg id="24">He splits himself up a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, where his characteristic yellow color shines in the darkness bluish, because the sulphur flows out also at night.</seg>
<seg id="25">The shadows provoking, it climbs in the light of a small helmet lamp at his helmet that he bought from his own money, into the crater.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 carriers load themselves the baskets with sulphur onto their shoulders at the crater ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In spite of their great profits the mine society did not mechanize the sulphur disassembly in order to save costs and provides the carriers, that work onto own bill and be paid to weight, no outfit.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not keep also any part of the 30,000 Rupien (2.5 euros) for Zuschlag per camera which the guardians of this nature park demand together with the admission at the level of 15,000 Rupien (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to the photographing of the volcano and the human carrying-donkeys.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for the animals and not for the human being" Madrusin, a carrier stocky, 42 years old, of the three decades protests since abandonment of the school works at the Kawah Ijen.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is in the situation, to support up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as it works" because he needs the money for the education of his three children in the age between 10 and 18 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes itch, if the wind turns suddenly and clamps the mine workers in the thick columns that climb up from the crater, the men are so hard, that nobody complains about difficult illnesses... natural except for the usual breath problems, arthrosis, pains in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that deformed from the weight of the baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With the basket on his back Unainik with his 53 years is only in the situation to bear 50 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day it and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, that of three LKWs about a goat path between the shrubbery to the warehouse in Tamansari in 18 kilometers distance are transported.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano my whole life was" Unainik declares at which it opens his mouth in which some teeth are missing far.</seg>
<seg id="36">From his five children the oldest with his 30 years works also as a sulphur-carrier.</seg>
<seg id="37">The time goes by, but the miserableness stops generation on generation in one of the hardest professions of the world: that of those ones who work as human load donkeys at the Kawah Ijen.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The sentences are part of a rapper song, that local sayings as e.g. "shift" does "one "bao" (Loaf) into the stove" in order about the low birth rate in Singapore merry.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Your creative conductor Douglas Hamilton say, that he wanted to use the power of the music to bringing the people to that, fulfill their "national duty".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This is something only for the Internet, therefore we had to design it merrily and wittily.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a question of the greatest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">While propagating we are the worst of the world, therefore we noticed that it is a question of a topic which we had to see to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had attempted many things as e.g. the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of Speed-Dating-evenings (fast flirts).</seg>
<seg id="13">Possible, that many of these ideas were creative, they did not lead, however, to the success compellingly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore we thought: Why do we not make something as creative as possible in order to approach this problem how to compose e.g. a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who does not take this topic easy is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every year she spends 1,300 United States dollars for political measures in order to incite the citizens to get more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Kind gives a parcel of the government for married couples and parents up to 15,000 dollars, prolongs the motherhood vacation and distributes tax advantages.</seg>
<seg id="19">But everything had little success up to now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich, highly-technological city state in the southeast of Asia which is known also to the conservatism of his ruling and his strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">According to his national population authority the birth rate is at the present time near 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">Last time, when this rate was over 2 - what is known also as a replacement rate - was in the year 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Therefore why get the Singaporeans not more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Ming, directress for marriage state and family politics of the national population authority, says that this is to be put down to a "better training" and "greater career chances".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This made for the people possible, except for getting married and forming a family considerably more options with respect to life aims of having and priorities put", she declares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in the social factors contributed to the higher number at singles and at the putting off of the marriage and births whose result is the decrease of the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile an immigration politics which is aimed at a drastic rise of the immigrations in order to counteract the decrease of the population led to resentments during the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore there are web pages, where the hardly hidden xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for their holding the wages low and not integrating themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The rise of the immigration is regarded also as one of the reasons for the government party achieving their worst election result in Singapore last year since the independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the choices an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and deliveries for foreign workers was made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the falling birth rate is having the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the tax yields, the health costs and the immigration politics, the example Singapore shows also unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government attempts to achieve that as many small apartments are not built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">So she already has also effects on the housing market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authority for urban development that is confessed as "Shoe boxes" and the city may be built in certain fields began with controlling the number at small studio apartments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These studio apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and show a great sales impact.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the worry exists, that they can support the life-style of the single, and that they deter the building firms from building big apartment for families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, president of the EL immovable company of Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold very much more quickly than bigger living-units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">You are so popular, and the units are faster around days and even weeks sold out as the bigger living-units.</seg>
<seg id="40">This results in their being very much better for our Cash Flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">He admits, however, that the new norms give the developers clearer orientations to which before obstacles were put into the way if they wanted to build too many small living-units within a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stress</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Even if these new rules could prepare the way for a rise of the national birth rate, it is to be understood from the conversations with the Singaporeans who work in the finance quarter that they will not have any great effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"The people are strongly stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, for which it is pushed out by many" a young manager says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The children can get others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"For me it is important, over" a man other, about twenty years old says "to decree my own money and time".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women mention their career, the stress and the costs for the property and the education as reasons for their not being able to have any children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Therefore the Singaporeans have to get the last word children if it is a question of that - there the government can do still so much.</seg>

<seg id="1">"South America must learn during the integration of the citizens", says Rafael Correa</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship "is" an objective with the case of which "in fact South America can learn something of Europe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"Correa who participated in the 6th summit conference of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) to occur in Lima declared the state television in Peru" that the Europeans "in the second world war and in other quarrels killed" themselves and are today practically a homeland."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense he defended the project, to create a South American citizenship that the member states of the Unasur drive forward.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The free traffic of the citizens and workers in all South American countries Must be achieved, how the case ist;es already in the Andes community gives this, however, still reactionary sectors that strive for a return into the past", it warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The president of Ecuador in addition approved the rearrangement layout of the organization of American states (OEA) under the handicap, to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to consider those that signed the agreement of San José about human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Those that teach never commit themselves to something, and in the corresponding train for this purpose we the South Americans sign always everything.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is unintelligible that the inter-American commission has their seat for human rights in Washington and is financed by the United States", it declared as an allusion to the political asylum, the Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has given.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa assured that he does not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles in this way but his "deep democratic values and opinions about human rights has come later.</seg>
<seg id="10">He added, that at that time it "justified suppositions has given, that Assange would be delivered to a third country and his procedure not be kept."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It in addition criticized the Swedish justice which demanded from it to subject it to an interrogation on his state field because of an alleged Sexualdelikts while "the Swedish jurisdiction is allowing this by means of a video conference which could have been carried out over the message of Ecuador in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa declared that the danger would exist that the health and the psychological state of Assange would be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since it is in our message, I did not speak with it, the ambassadress informed me, however, of his having an easy problem with the lungs, however, none fatal", the head of state of Ecuador said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The danger that it would take physical and psychological damage because it is caught in a narrow room and cannot carry out any physical exercises in the open air withstands it, however.</seg>
<seg id="15">"That would influence the health of every human being", he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa served, that the solution for the asylum that was given to Assange since the month of June in the message of Ecuador in London is the grant of a charter with which he can travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Swedes and the juridical authorities Europa's. It underlined that there were conversations with London in order to find a solution for the founder of WikiLeaks locked up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not sell the human rights, we do not use this word for this case, there were, however, constant conversations.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution for this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Swedes and the juridical authorities of Europe because the attorney leads a row from Assange, Baltazar Garzón, of procedures on different European authorities", it declared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And "if morning gives this charter to Great Britain, this is in my opinion done."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or above Skype as it approves the Swedish jurisdiction and was made in other cases, the problem is done.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took the opportunity, in order to be confirmed as defenders of the freedom of the press and said, that what he" does not "tolerate", this mediocrity that bad intention and the lie that invalidates the free opinion comment are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The tallest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the bad and perverted politicians, but bad journalists that strive for profit and blackmail", he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this sense he congratulated himself, "that Ecuador is not governed by the bankers or hegemonic and spit middle class countries anymore of such journalists and neither", and anticipated, that it "will deepen" with the case of a re-election "the revolution, in order to continue the way into this correct direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa supported also the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to his next choices in the case of which he argued that the organism "must stay "hard and no opportunism and none as a coup dressed up legal may allow", because "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay was destroyed" by that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The president of Ecuador in addition holds the wish of his Colombian vis-a-vis, Juan Manuel Santos, now and to discuss the lake-legal borders between both countries according to the judgment of the International court of justice of The Hague, which divided the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua, for "completely entitled."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At the present time this judgment is not transformed.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a question of a problem between one south- and a Central American state.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are unavoidable, they must be overcome, however, in the aspiration to a common way.</seg>
<seg id="29">You must be treated comprehensively so that one can overcome it and look forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In the same way he trusted in a good end of the quarrels about the lake borders between Peru and Chile in front of the same court of justice and meant that it is correct for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries sign up to accept the judgment himself if it in a very hard way breaks down."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">With respect to the possibility that he positions himself into Ecuador as a candidate for the next premiership choices in order to reach his third mandate in consequence he served, that it this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy sees although sometimes it is difficult also very much."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa assured that he would withdraw from the political life if he lost the choices in February 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Power has never interested me personally, but under so unfair circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement had the belief that I was it that guaranteed this probable victory, therefore I must follow this responsibility", he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If I should win, it would be my last period as a president, after that I withdraw from the public life.</seg>
<seg id="36">This is valid also if we lose.</seg>
<seg id="37">"That is decisive", it declared.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa took Bezug of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, also onto the treatment of the sanitary problems of the president in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I spoke just with the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He said to me that he traveled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that it would be expected that he can travel to Cuba after the choice campaign again.</seg>
<seg id="40">It commented, "It does not mean a relapse in any case in the health state of the president Chávez".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in the 6th summit conference of the state and government leaders of the union of South American nations (Unasur) that was ended with the call for a higher regional integration in order to guarantee for a lasting progress, equality and security in Lima.</seg>

<seg id="1">A too late recognition is cause for a death because of Aids today</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when one confirmed him the investigation result: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if a bomb struck", he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis that the doctor without "weakening" recognizable success "attempted".</seg>
<seg id="4">He hid it from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided, to see only to his illness and began with finding oneself out of that; and this with such use, that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is undoubtedly to one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), into which it came after several fights in 1994.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio lives with the humane Immundefizienz-virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hardly conceivable at the beginning of the nineties, when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more stigmata.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided it itself to say goodbye "because it led to a dead end-de-sac."</seg>
<seg id="9">Then AIDS was synonym for death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with living quality.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, still many persons come into the clinic that does not know anything of their illness and that already caused the virus at those ones damage and that exhausted their immune system, and the victims of opportunistischen infections are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"The great success means", 31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, that is after appearance of the first told cases, "today, that are exactly now the survival of a patient that incorporates the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population", the conductor of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, near which he said that this information in April of this year was supported by a scientific publication had a look at, declared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented on the scientists concluding since the year 2008, AIDS not being indeed a death sentence, however, the years of the survival and the living quality of the degree of the influence of the immune system of the persons at beginning of the treatment taking off and that that greater chances would have, that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years a counting's of 200 CD4 and 50 years' with the case of a counting of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply said, the above carrying out means, that, who in the age of 25 years the diagnosis keeps HIV-positive, in this sense "problem-free 75 years old can become as long as he is under surveillance" this specialist declared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to be able to classify this progress correctly, must be reminded of the durability of the Mexicans today being on the average 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Even if the mortality has been reduced in the last years significantly (in Mexico the number of the persons which people die of AIDS reduced 4,862 to itself from 6,678 cases in the year 2007 in the year 2011 (Annual report of the ONUSIDA)), nevertheless it is correct that since the appearance of AIDS 60 percent of the patients registered in the national database have died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 persons died in the year of 2011, and up to the month of May of this year it is already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there is universal access to the antiretroviralen drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- Why do always people die therefore still of that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- In my opinion the problem is not the access to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the last 12 years we had no supply problems near the medicines. The problem is that the persons come in far advanced state because they do not know their infection state that is in very late phases of the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It does a beating statement: "Coming" to "nine of ten patients to us if they have already a concurrent infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, for which recognition tests must be offered to all persons with whom this is necessary massively."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The specialists and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee for the AIDS-avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio which made carry out his test near a private lab agree to this proposal, and this was that one for the only reason because a friend of it had done it in spite of his young age already in the AIDS-phase and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a crustaceous tumor) had what one of the usual complications is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything is different if you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and would not like to hear anything.</seg>
<seg id="26">"When I must already die, burst more gladly then three times", one says in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was to the there improvement, I eat well, do sport and take the medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today his parents only know that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, as anyone else also.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, undertake a lot, split up an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person, Fabrizio that agreed counts in order to encourage with his report those that today are afraid within the framework of the worldwide AIDS day his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You should do the test if they belong to the risk group. Know ever formerly it whether they are HIV-positive, all the better, and when they already know the diagnosis, they are supposed to learn how one can live as all people responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="32">His information is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Between the health programs and the simple citizen big holes exist, declares Ricardo Salazar, journalist, from Guadalajara who took care of the thing of the HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the most important thing is the prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the places characterized to that "the distribution was increased from condoms in fact; formerly they were given separately, now they add parcels to us with a hundred pieces, which is already good, there are, however, still people who do not "have" any access to a condom", he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">The young people belong to the risk persons for new infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"To what you need that one"? a spread mockery question of social workers, orientation personnel in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, is which young people would not like to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested to inform this inefficient distribution again; the condoms are not supposed to be only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities to which frequently young people go.</seg>
<seg id="40">The promiscuity is not supposed to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="41">The beer and motel is not supposed to be paid to them as the governor Emilio González answered the question whether under his administration preservative would be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to familiarize those that carry out already a sexual activity" "with the condoms", it brought it onto the point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key data of Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state lies nationally seenly near 4th place of new and accumulated AIDS-cases, and near 13th place with respect to HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of the contagion cases occur via sexual intercourse, 6% about the blood and 2% in a perinatal way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It is reckoned that 50,000 persons with HIV live because there are 4 or 5 persons who do not know it for every registered case.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the practice that one leads on 15th June issued recognition of the judgment by the judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas to the Mexican enterprises of the seizure of their property being helplessly exposed to bravo beyond the river.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">While the judge of the thing is referring to the believers having to succumb to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit with seat in New Orleans says first of all that it is with the case of the main procedure of the commercial bankruptcy handled in Mexico a question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures with the case of insolvency of enterprises with country-comprehensive profile is not known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In fact the model law of the United Nations for the unification of the international commercial law with the case of which the American Law was used institutes as a mediator was created for this purpose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly the judgment determines that without the voices of the societies after recognition of the obligations in the bankruptcy mass which the branches of Vitro with their holding company had the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, this possibility of the Mexican laws is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact Vitro is not the first case in which this pattern was approved.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is half a dozen of examples, under that Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, who obligations were confirmed to the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal institute for commercial bankruptcies) under enterprises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correct is in addition, that to withdrawal of the voices of the branches the believers of Vitro, the believers that complained near the courts of the United States against Vitro, that is the vulture funds as to B. Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited would have reached, no majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would be 45 percent gone out against 37 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This is not considered by the court of appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the other hand it gives Vitro Schuld for his difficult situation 2008 within the framework of the great economical crisis in the United States that gave strokes to the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For this reason the family González Sada inserts contradiction before the same court of appeal through h so that the vote occurs in the plenum. of all judges, because only three of them voted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">That is not allowed to, if the Cerciorare-objection is made which requires the inspection of the procedure through a higher authority, in this case through the Uppermost court of justice of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The fatal thing at this case is, that the court let a document that was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the court) in which the procedure carried out by Vitro is described within the framework of the law about commercial bankruptcies, and in which refers to its having asked strictly the descendants signed from both countries in order to correspond to the chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States aside.</seg>

<seg id="1">Héctor "Hetin" Of Reyes: "Basketball was my living"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The globetrotter of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was associated to the basket sport longer than 60 years and bereist the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few in Puerto Rico have a so big intellectual collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Of Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Before it was tied to the rotation chair by a stroke in the year 2008, Rexes was for 6 years part of this sport, it is to the first national league, to authorized representative and to conductor in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or to president of the basketball association as players of lower classes, players.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"My life long I put myself on many hats in the basketball, even several simultaneously when I was president of the BSN, main manager of the national team and president of the association in the nineties" Reyes remembered at a visit of Primera Hora with it at home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his true wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career almost all and testify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The most emotional memories are those that remind of his time at the Vaqueros of the middle of the fifties as players to 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year long anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or managers of the club.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Those ones were my best years that I enjoyed the most because I am a part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 it than were allowed to be managers, Mitgeschäftsführer or coaches.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were years fulfilling many, including the five championships after each other of 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye with a championship 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">Off then took over "Cuco" Ortiz that was a very good manager" says Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I still know that Gene said Bartow which worked as a coach here and was done by Alabama (Birmingham) at the university to me: "I have a player very strong and 2 m tall.</seg>
<seg id="16">You would like it"?</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who Puerto Rico ever had.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow recommended after that the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse who could be naturalized and was one of our best throwers.</seg>
<seg id="19">I still know how he said that Gausse would worry for another if Mincy had facilitated a championship for Bayamon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was given to him, however already out of a distance, because it already stood in 1988 at uppermost place of the association.</seg>
<seg id="21">At this time he preferred to enjoy his enforcements and those of Mincy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I still know when we won for the first time during the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the USA.</seg>
<seg id="23">After that the world championship came in 1990, at which we the fourth place occupied, Reyes said what actually bronze should have been if this Canadian referee had not been that made us the last game train for the second time repeat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Was this group of the world championship 1990 the best national team which you ever saw?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It belongs to the best, as also those who won during the Olympiad 2004 against the Dream Team.</seg>
<seg id="26">My favorite is, however, the team of the Pan-American games 1991 in Cuba, where we extracted gold and offered a fight to the team of the USA, as, when they extracted bronze against us during the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">Near that team only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were not again in this case, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Of Morales that could not be in 1990 because of a knee injury in this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team which maybe was not the best with which we, however, won a gold medal and which prepared great joy for us with respect to personalities was that of the vorolympischen tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players as "Canito" Of Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as substitute for the banned players because of the incidents on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal towards every prediction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">That was Piculín Ortiz without doubts.</seg>
<seg id="32">His numbers on level of the international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody in Puerto Rico dominated on this level so as Piculín did.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">That is a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a series of good coaches as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">From the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What believes you is the best thing that you achieved in the association?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">I was a part of the most successful era of the national team of 1988 to 1995 which the BSN grasped to up to 17 teams at the beginning of the nineties in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Does what still doing remain to you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things which I would have imported as e.g. the regionalization of the lower categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">That play the Jungs in Ponce e.g. only in their field and stumble on teams first in the national Playoffs from other corners of the island.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today the children do unnecessarily many journeys and games.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the result of the stipulated training and courses in coaches, table-official ones and referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">On that I am proud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What do you do today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I hear music gladly, sees videos of music of my time in YouTube enjoys, my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.</seg>
<seg id="49">And of course I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel who was always at my page.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I did not notice, that this the most apocalyptic semester is, that it ever gave" Charmé said to the students this week at the university Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If somebody analyzes what pleasing is today as if we were away thirty days of that in the world, would be this a really good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And it reminds of the bad thing being good for those with apocalyptic mentality.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze, for which these ideas with the time spread", he said, as well as the kind and way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear material reaches the hands from terrorists, for example a war could break out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month the students films with apocalyptic contents analyzed and examined as they could be compared in comparison with the real life.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17">In spite of the "imminent fall" the students must study, create projects and participate in final examinations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In Penn State the final examination is carried out at the eve of the apocalypse, for which the students do not have any other chance than "to weiterarbeiten up to the night, where the world supposedly draws to a close", said restable.</seg>
