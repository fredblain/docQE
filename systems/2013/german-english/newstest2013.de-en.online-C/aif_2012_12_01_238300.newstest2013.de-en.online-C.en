"The large and powerful" leads until Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While delegate and Bürgerrechtler discuss about that, which utility brings the law over binding jumping it for migrants, criminal act already with falsified certificates
Annually 13 million foreign workers to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia come.
That of them are the citizens of the headquarters Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
It is the your single goal to earn money for the support of the families remaining in the homeland.
On the 1st of December, a law stepped effective, that according to every work migrant a test, that certifies knowledge of the Russian language, discard must.
Previously this regulation applies only to migrants, whom in the service sector, in which municipal dwelling economy want to work and in the retail trade.
However the tests should become gradually according to federal migration authority future for all foreign workers the duty.
At the same time one must discard not only jumping it, but rather also tests into the Russian story and the bases of the legislation.
Must knowledge of language both proved become for the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizen of countries, in whom Russian is office language.
Also of this law excluded are people who have receive its education testimonies and diploma before the ruin the Ussr in 1991.
Sense, problematic nature and protection of the rights
The entirety of the test places becomes language under the Ägide of the Puschkin institute for the Russian, that Russian university of the friendship among nations, that moscovite of nationals university, that saint Peter castle of nationals stand university and other Russian universities.
The migrants can discard the tests in all cities; already now already more were opened in Russia than 160 corresponding centers.
The initiative to the introduction of the tests was supported of the delegates of the Staatsduma and the federal migration authority.
Bürgerrechtler on the other hand asked question following in the press repeatedly before the taking effect of the law: What does that bring very actually?
Which variations does the direction bring to have to show knowledge of language, both for the Russians and for the foreign workers?
Above all, reply speaker of the migration authority, would go it therefore to diminish the number of the slave laborers.
"Many speak now over the protection of the rights of work migrants", says the leader of the representation of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Your rights must be protected however already against its departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
On problems, migrants knock without occupation, development, knowledge of language and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant will meet without knowledge of language inevitably people with evil intentions, who stick it under the pretext of aid into some dark, narrow barracks, where he from will await with dozens his equal months without meal and documents and 12 to 14 hours will work at the day.
Many troubles of our migrants reach us.
"In the homeland becomes you the one promised, and in the arrival become you deceived, get its passports decreased and receive not the promised wage", confirms the leader of the central administration for work migration of the tadschikischen migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Do not scold, boss!
Nevertheless many citizens of the centrally Asian republics, who want to earn its money in Russia, admit, that they do not control not only the language of the goal country, but rather can express itself also in its own language hardly in writing.
That is natural not so very its guilt when rather the evil: Only A FEW Turkmenen, Usbeken and Tadschiken can afford also only a sensible reason education.
For in its families, it does not give yet once money in order to nourish the children, let alone, them respectable clothing to buy shoes and school things.
As a teenager, these children seize then at once the first opportunity to the Geldverdienen.
"It is difficult without knowledge of language", admit it.
"You feel lowers you and inferiorly".
Bürgerrechtler emphasize following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status must discard the test.
Do not have this status, gives it no test and consequently no official work.
In the meantime the large part of the foreign workers stays further illegally in Russia.
"Sincerely welcome" or "access for unauthorized forbidden"
Many migrants confirm that it is not simple to receive in Russia an official status.
Bureaucratic hurdles are the reason and natural the linguistic difficulties.
Moreover costs the legalizations moneys: 12 to 16 thousands rouble.
One can make a falsified registration quickly and solely for one and a half thousands.
The colleagues of the Russian police know that our documents are falsified chiefly and we are not registered, and from that cases of extortion emerge then.
"You want on or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea", expresses itself the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow vis-à-vis journalists.
Shun" "merely no costs for incorrect papers
Already at the day, at which the law stepped effective turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be falsified.
Some falsified certificates, that certify the completion of the jumping it, became fitting taken already of colleagues of the federal migration authority.
The falsified papers were printed with an usual color printer.
Naturally the new owners received this not for nothing: To be able to save every migrant who hoped, itself so the tests, paid documents seven thousand for that rouble.
That is more than twice as much like the costs for the official test: This costs a work migrant three thousand roubles.
About the fact that the most important direct task exists therein of protecting the system against corruption so that the certifications cannot be bought simply, are itself both office carrier and Bürgerrechtler united.
For the moment, the authorities only can promise foreign workers, who fall in the first time through the test, that they receive time for a language mean course.
In addition newcomers are offered without knowledge of language places in areas, in which no active understanding with people is necessary.
