Guidelines for the inflating of air balloon, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, that annually a survey exclaims over the most absurd bank fees, concluded this year to arrange the competition ordinance "most absurd and/or idea out of the EU workshop".
"On this idea brought us the plan proposed recently by the EU, a woman quota of 40% in the management of large European firms to introduce", said Patrik Nacher, that attends to the organization of this survey, vis-à-vis the newspaper Právo.
Under the nominated absurdities, the judgment of the European court is for example over the unification of the insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until there, women wetted an advantage in life insurances because they represent a slighter risk for the insurance companies objectively.
"Further incredible ideas out of the EU workshop can be nominated until end of this year.
The actual voting results then until the end of February 2013", divided Nacher with.
To the controversial EU ordinances, the binding addition of organic ethanol belongs among other things to fuels, that is in its consequence nature damaging, the further the ban of the dependable mercury thermometers only because these contain a relatively slight quantity of this danger material, or also the guideline to the size of chicken cages, because of which this year eggs more expensively became substantially.
Criticism harvested also the factual ban of the use of the concept in the past "Butteraufstrich" or also the sale ban for conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be long 14 cm
The EU apparatus decides often under the pressure of this or those lobbies out of trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are represented as a rule of one or several member nations, (so tries the Czech Republic presently for example, also with veto threat the demands of Czech banks to put through).
Lobby interests stood also behind it that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and may show no "curve anomaly".
The European commission defended itself at the same time with the argument that it would harmonize solely the inconsistent single national standards, that would hinder the trade.
The standards regarding fruit and vegetable were softened of the EU against the resistance of some countries already with the reference that the previous guidelines would lead to a waste of groceries.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is possibly the EU ordinance of the past year, that equipped will must in accordance with air balloon in the sale with the reference, that children may not inflate under eight years the air balloon without supervision of an adult.
The EU referred at the same time to an American study, that in accordance with air balloon the leading cause are in asphyxiation death of children.
A similar restriction applies already to children until 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are strange ideas also at home
Relatively absurdly also a guideline, that is concerns the European officials themselves - every, that in the EU an official function takes in, the label Macedonian may not use because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must say instead FYROM (form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky. com nominated in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez fair next to that above mentioned. Absurdity also the EU ordinance on the circumference of groceries supplies in the field of a member nation.
The EU determined joins be might therewith the highly volume at groceries supplies, that at the day of our EU it in the field of the Czech republic.
The Czech Republic exceeded then for example the determined volume for fungus canned food for what a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were impressed also of the idea that certain countries money should receive for that, that they have no sea, or to give however of the idea, promote moneys for proposals on promote moneys.
These ideas came to be sure not from Brussels, but rather from Prague.
"We are handicapped in that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement in the EU", explained the at that time country Secretary of Commerce Jaroslav Palas in the autumn 2004.
As an argument, it led on that the grain harvest had been very high and the national warehouses as a result of that so-called. Intervention purchases overfilled were.
Because the Czech Republic would have a further way to lake harbors, the EU should pay Euro according to Palas hundreds of millions at us.
The European commission came the Czech Republic in the end so far toward that it organized an announcement over the purchase of grain out of countries, that have no access to the sea.
Promote moneys for proposals on promote moneys offered the ministry for regional development under direction of minister Pavel (US DEU) to the communities, concretely should concern it at the same time means for the Aufsetzung of Fördergeldanträgen at Brussels.
EU: Bizarre ordinances are the exception
Ordinances are earned in the member nations to be sure easy to the target of the criticism, the efforts of the EU around regulation of and therewith also around effectiveness and development the entire European Union in the opinion of some experts however sooner recognition.
A more serious problem the EU promote moneys are in the opinion of these experts sooner for projects, that jointly have purely nothing at all with the involvement of the European integration, that were forced however in the household negotiations by single member nations.
Emotions also the fact evokes in this country that the Czech Republic of labels specific similar to other member nations in Brussels around the right on use of traditional products must fight and not always wins this battle at the same time.
The Czech Republic was able to defend to be sure the label after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria "Olomoucké, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský around), whose tradition go back here into the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename however in "Tuzemák".
The label around may be used only for products out of sugarcane distillate, not for products out of sugar beet.
In the official list of the product registered in the EU, Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker of marzipan or the Parmaschinkens immerse also that in the company of the world-famous cheese sorts now Karlsbad rusk, carp from and or also the Saazer hops up.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the rolls can themselves there breasts.
