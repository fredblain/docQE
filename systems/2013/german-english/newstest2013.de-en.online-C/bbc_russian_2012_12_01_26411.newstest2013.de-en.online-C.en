Share of legal weapons at criminal offenses extremely slightly
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans an intensification of the weapon law for private possession of firearms.
Therewith the authorities react to the youngest events: Injured in shootings on weddings as well as seven dead in the crazed rampage of the moscovite lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police does not want to forbid the carrying of deadly weapons in the public and here wants to mount the age for the possession of firearm of 18 on 21 years.
The chairperson of the Duma committee on security and corruption fight, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised the suggestion that the changes are produced at the weapon law briefly the Duma.
Everyone is not therewith satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems through "attraction of the screws".
On the Internet an open letter was published, whose authors - representative of different weapon associations - demand by the authorities, to take by "senseless intensification" distance.
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very slight, expressed the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, to the Russian service of the BBC.
