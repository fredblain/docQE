Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the mercury
The probe messenger found proofs that it gives mercury on the planet ice.
The ice cover should be thick possibly up to 20 meters.
The US space flight authority NASA proved the existence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although it lies the sun at the next, there is also there frozen water how out of studies published three on Thursday in the specialty magazine "Science" follows.
The probe messenger had found proofs that there is an ice cover in the region lying permanently in the shadow of the planet.
This should at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters be thick.
The water came probably of comet or possibly also asteroids, that are hit on the mercury.
No one would bring the finding of ice however with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the boss scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the mercury can until to 426 degrees centigrade reach.
The findings could help however at the same time to clarify how water and other building blocks of life arrived into other areas of the solar system.
Unseen of the earth citizens probes, telescope and small robots such as phoenix are there, to investigate the depths of the universe.

With the telescope, the colors come to be sure better to the validity.

Saturn and its rings: How these emerged, one of the large riddles of the astronomy is.
Possibly they are the remnants of a Saturn moon that disappeared before 4.5 billion years without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest receptions of the Hubble telescope: The whirlpool galaxy
According to Farbgebung, receptions become to preserve of Spiralgalaxien works of art.
The reception published by the European south observatory shows removed that several thousand light years Trifid fog in the constellation of protection.
The name Trifid comes of the Latin word trifidus (dreigeteilt, dreigespalten), there dark dust strips the glowing heart of the star birth site dreiteilen.
In the constellation snake carrier astronomers photographed the precursors of a cosmic Karambolage: 400 million light year of the earth removes race the kernels these fusing galaxies on each other to and will collide unavoidable together.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the Spiralgalaxie M83.

The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a cut out of the iris fog in the constellation Kepheus.
Fog removed from exists are smaller the 1400 light years dust grain, the ten to hundred times than an usual house dust.
This picture was joined out of optical and of x-ray receptions different telescope.
It shows removes from a ring black holes, 430 million light year of the earth.
This group of galaxies, Arp 273 named, took the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa up.
Scientists UGC 1810 name the larger Spiralgalaxie.
In this star fog, the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way is.
The star cradle produces always new Youngster.
Also this star cloud, connected with the Rosetten fog, produces running new baby stars - 5000 light years of the earth removes.
In this brightly radiating galaxy with a small black hole, yet no dust exists, but rather only gas.
Researchers assume that he emerged first shortly after the Big Bang, when in the universe predominantly hydrogen was to be found.
Our insights in that all: The most important telescopes
The telescope should have been invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - yet before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to the star observation.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became more and more larger - and the insights that deliver it, always deeper.
For 30 years, the Hale telescope in the Palomar observatory, namely of 1947 to 1975, was near San Diego the largest telescope of the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows views in that all immediately over two mirrors, every with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The thoughts and feelings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Kanareninsel La Palma is tremendously - alone of the mirrors comes on 10.4 meters in the diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - around costs to save.
Nevertheless it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable method of building: The telescope is in its height angle festgezurrt - and therewith in its mobility restricts.
Also the hobby-Eberly-telescope in Texas is fixed in the height angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light collecting power.
This passes namely - in spite of comparatively slight mirror diameter - at that of the mirror telescope largest worldwide up to.
By means of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers monitor that all after extraterrestial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), every computer owner can help in that he makes available computing power.
View of the observatory of the European observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope stands - that its name all honor makes.
With its altogether four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate also the middle infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its head mirror should comprise satisfied 42 meters - and out of nearly 1000 mirror elements together set become.
With pictures is to be calculated however at the earliest 2018.
Until 2007 counted both bold telescopes on the hawaiianischen volcano Mauna Kea as the largest of the world.
They offer immediately two mirrors with an average apiece of ten meters.
The bold telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-observatory that looks next to them yet with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF into the sky.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, gigantic telescope should emerge - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an illustration to marvel at.
The most important impressions out of that the space telescope Hubble all delivers however.
Since the 24th of April 1990 it has delivered already pictures from a distance worlds.
Since March 2009 the space telescope Kepler has searched for extra solar planet - especially after such, that are inhabitable.
On the 2nd of February 2011 was announced of the Nasa that 1235 planet candidates were determined since mission start.
In the picture, the last start preparations are documented at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) becomes all shot at the earliest 2018 on board an Ariane5-Rakete in that.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should search for light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that also at the south pole of the mercury ice exists.
To be sure there are for that no reliable data because the messengers circles far more closely at the north pole around the planet.
Radar measurements pointed for decades on that that there is ice on the mercury.
Through the 2004 started messenger probe - the first, that around the mercury circles -, the scientists have now certainty.
