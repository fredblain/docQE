A republican strategy in order to confront the re-election of Obama
The managements of the republicans justify its politics with the necessity, to fight the choice fraud.
To be sure the Brennan center latter considers to be a myth in that it strengthens, that the choice fraud more rarely is in the USA than the amount of the person killed by the lightning strike.
The lawyers of the republicans indicated only 300 cases of choice fraud in 10 years in the USA by the way.
One is certain: these new determinations will affect negatively the voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partially the democratic system of the USA.
In contrast to Canada, the US states is responsible for the execution of the choices in the single countries.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments announced since 2009 new laws, that impede the procedure for the registration or the going to the polls.
This phenomenon became more meaningful after the choices of the November 2010, with which 675 new republican representatives in 26 countries could be indicated.
As a result 180 bill were introduced alone in 2011, that restrict the execution of the right to vote in 41 countries.
The new choice laws demand that the voters produce a photo identification card and a proof of the US country citizenry.
In addition the periods are shortened through these laws also for the premature voting, arranged that declares right to be invalidly to register themselves at the election day as a voter, and citizens the right to vote, for which a court document exists.
Before the choices of 2006, no US country of the voters demanded to show a photo identification card.
Indiana was the first state that raised such a demand.
The colonel court of the United States confirmed the constitution temperance of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The republican authorities hurried to expand this practice to other countries.
In the course of the last two year, they promoted in 34 states of bill, with which the voters are forced to show a photo identification card.
It importantly is to be noticed in that the US citizens does not control in contrast to Quebec an universal identification card card such as the health insurance card.
In the deed possess 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million entitled to vote people no photo identification card issued by a government authority its country.
In addition five million reelections in 2012 do not control such an identification card.
To be sure more are to be paid frequently than hundred dollars in order to received the required identification card.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minority and people with low income disproportionately strongly are concerned.
In the deed, $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years do not control 25% of the Afro Americans, 15% of the people with an income of less than the required photo identification card.
This passes along yet.
It the student, whom are not looked at as a voter, whom deliver its voice increased for democratic candidates, is permitted in several countries to use its photo identification card issued by its arrangement.
On the other hand the same countries permit it members of hinge society or hunt society, who select more strongly for the republican side, to use the cards issued by these societies for choices.
Before 2004, no state demanded for the selecting a proof of the country citizenry.
Arizona was the first state that introduced such a demand.
Since 2011 dismissed a dozen of countries of laws, that demand of the voters, that they prove its US country citizenry.
These measures aim clearly on that to limit the hispanischen voices.
For it lies on the hand that two of three hispanischen voters that democratic party prefer.
In addition republican legislators 2011 in eight states of laws promoted, with whom the registration was abolished by voters at the election day.
In addition you restricted the right of individual and groups to perform those voters aid position, that would like to register itself.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example the campaigns to the voter registration contributed in the general choices 2004 in addition, ca. To register 10 millions of citizen.
For through the measures dismissed since 2009, the share of the registration by reelections 2010 in comparison with 2006 diminished itself around 17%.
Moreover the republican legislators in five further states of laws dismissed, who aim on that to shorten the period for the premature voting.
For example were in the general choices 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters, that selected in advance, Afro American although they settle only 13% of the voters of the state.
Same applies to the hispanische population.
Latter only 11% of the voters settled, but 24% of the citizens that selected in advance.
In contrast to that the white that represented 76% of the voters settled, only 46% of the voters, that selected in advance.
Naturally the democratic legislators and its followers opposed vigorously the dismissal of laws, that the registrations of the voters restrict.
Several bill were blocked through the vetos of the democratic governors.
The general lawyer of the USA interfered in order to stop the most disputed laws.
They partially were able to limit the damages.
For example only 16 of the 34 states of laws dismissed, that demand the showing of a photo identification card.
To be sure the newly introduced rules in 2012 will impede undoubtedly the execution of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the dismissed laws and see the influence of the results in that in them as a clear goal for 2012 decisive countries.
A report of the Brennan of center of 2011 shows that those countries that dismissed these laws to win 171 of the 270 voices settle, that are required in the delegate group, around the presidency.
It is too early in order to confirm with certainty that these changes of the legal specifications will have at the choice system considerable effects on the result of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is certain: these new determinations will affect negatively the voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partially the democratic system of the USA.
