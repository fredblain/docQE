"South America must in the integration of the citizens learn", says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a joint country citizenry is a goal, whereby "South America can" learn actually something of Europe.
Correa, that participated on the 6th summit meeting of the presidents of the union South American nations (Unasur), that in Lima took place, explained the national television in Peru that the Europeans "in the second world war and in other discussions killed" themselves and are" "today practically a homeland.
In this sense defended it the project to create a South American country citizenry, that the member countries of the Unasur push.
"Reached will must the free traffic of the citizens and worker in all South American countries, like this already in the Andes partnership the case is it gives to be sure yet reactionary sectors, the one return into the past strive for", warned he.
The president Ecuadors advocated moreover the reorganisation of the organization of American countries (OEA) under the specification to diminish the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to consider that, that have signs the agreement of San José over human rights.
That that teach never promise to something, and in return in addition we sign the South Americans always all.
"It is incomprehensible, that the interamerikanische commission for human rights its seat in Washington has and of the United States financed becomes", declared it as an allusion on the political asylum, that granted Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that it would not regret this decision, because it had not betrayed therewith its principles, but rather would be come later its "deep democratic values and views over human rights".
It added that there had been at that time "established suppositions, that Assange delivered at a third country and its procedure would not become" kept.
It criticized moreover the Swedish justice that had demanded by it to subject it on its country zone because of an alleged sexual offense to an interrogation while "the Swedish jurisdiction permits this by means of a video conference, that over the message Ecuadors in London would have carried out will can".
Correa explained that the danger would exist, that the health and the psychic condition would be impaired by Assange.
"Since then he herself in our message finds, have I not with it spoken, the ambassador has me to be sure informs, that he an easy problem with the lungs has, but no serious", said the country chief Ecuadors.
The danger exists to be sure that it would take physical and psychic damage, because it would be caught in a narrow room and could carry out no physical practices in the free.
"That would become the health of every person impair", joined he thereto.
Correa indicated that the solution for the asylum, that was granted Assange for the month of June in the message Ecuadors in London, that would be granting of a license, wherewith it could travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juristic authorities Europe it. It unterstrich that it had given with London of conversations in order to find a solution for the locked in founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with the human rights, we do not turn this word for this case on, there had been to be sure permanent conversations.
"The solution for this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juristic authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a row of procedure on different European instances leads", explained he.
And "if Great Britain grants morning this license, this is settled" according to my opinion.
And if Sweden of Mr. Assange interrogated on the message Ecuadors in London or over Skype, how it allows the Swedish jurisdiction and was made in other cases, would be settled the problem.
Correa used the opportunity in order to be confirmed as a defender of the press freedom and said that that what he would not tolerate, "the mediocrity, that bad intention and the lie are, that the freedom of speech weaken".
"The largest enemies of the press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but rather bad journalists, that after profit strive and blackmail", said he.
In this sense congratulated he herself that Ecuador ahead did not take no longer "and also of the banks or hegemonic and spear middle class countries controlled becomes" of such journalists, and, that he will deepen "the revolution in a re-election in order to continue" the way into this correct direction.
Correa supported also the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least to its next choices whereby it argued, that the organisms became" "hard remain must and no opportunism and no as legal disguised country stroke grant may", because through it "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay destroyed.
The president Ecuadors considers moreover the wish of its Colombian opposite, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the international court of the Hagues, that divided before the maritime country highness of Nicaragua, to negotiate the lake legal boundaries between both countries with Nicaragua, to be "absolutely entitles".
Presently this judgment is not transferred.
It concerns a problem between one South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are unavoidable, they must be overcome however in the striving after a joint way.
They must be treated comprehensively so that one can overcome it and can view forwards.
Just as it trusted on a good conclusion of the disputes over the lake boundaries between Peru and Chile before the same court and meant that "it is correct for Latin America to call international instances if both countries promise to suppose the judgment even if it very hard precipitates".
With regard to the possibility that he stands as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to reach its third mandate in consequence, indicated he that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it also very heavily falls" sometimes.
Correa assured that, if it would lose the choices in February 2013, it out of the political life withdraw would become.
Power never interested me personally, but under so unjust circumstances such as in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can be corrected only by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief, that I it was, that this probable victory guaranteed, therefore must I this responsibility come later", said it.
If I should win, it would be retract me my last period as a president, after that I out of the public life.
This counts also if we lose.
"That is decided", explained it.
Correa made reference also to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I spoke just with the vice president about Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. It said that it had traveled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that expected would become, to me that it could travel after the choice campaign again to Cuba.
"It means in no case a relapse in the state of health of the president Chávez", commented on it.
The ecuadorianische head of state took today in Lima on the 6th summit meeting of the heads of state and heads of the government of nations (Unasur) South American the union part, that was concluded with the proclamation to a higher regional integration, in order to provide for a persistent progress, equivalence and security.
