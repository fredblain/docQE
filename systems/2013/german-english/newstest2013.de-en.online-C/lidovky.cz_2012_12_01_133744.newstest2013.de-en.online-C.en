The film Argo: If it stands most badly, call Hollywood
In November 1979 occupied a Mob of demonstrating Islamist students the US American message in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For whose release they demanded the extradition of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, that was implored after the revolution into the USA, that had preserved over decades the patronage over its regime.
For the American government, there was no positive exit out of this situation - it was not able to afford it to throw the Shah over board because this massively would have damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
Simultaneous it was not in a position, in the Iran where the revolution flowed into the installation of a theokratischen regimes to put through the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow for the call of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of the hostage release made all only more badly.
That caught were released taken diplomat in the end after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated through the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages evoked at home a wave of the solidarity as well as antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in the Iran contributed considerably to the defeat Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben ape leak describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small part victory.
Directly before the occupation of the message, the flight succeeded six message colleagues.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
It succeeded helped the CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the fugitives out of the Iran; at the same time them an extravagant story to the Verdeckung of its true identity - it traveled camouflaged with Canadian passports as members of a film rod, whom nominally in the country film location visited for a Science-Fiction-film.
Combination of the genres
That of the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed made plan also the collaboration Hollywoods required.
So that the disguise became trustworthy, articles appeared over this film project in trade journals, it were held off press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were held long secret. The film relies on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Ape leak film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one side, it is a realistic Politthriller, simultaneously however also a so-called. "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a gelungenen of hussar piece such as for example the film Ocean's it Eleven.
Through it the mood plains change themselves in the film from - on the one side the Dokumentarszenen out of Teheran (in the title sequence become ikonische contemporary photographys shown, and also in the film frame of the same situations gives it no large differences).
On the other side the loose passages from Hollywood, that ironically and easily exaggerates come therefore.
And then there are yet the scenes out of the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the discussion table, on the office halls, at the telephone...
Ben ape leak a remarkable new start of its career is arrive with this film.
Out of one, actors smiled at became a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is now no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is its third feature film after the Krimi no children's game (Gone baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).
It is simultaneous ape leak first film that does not play in the native Boston of the director.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place belonged at the same time to the features, that removed the prior films of this director of the standard Hollywoods.
Ape leak proves this feel however also in Argo where Teheran becomes "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show really taken place have the reconstruction of events, that - the entrance sequence of the Erstürmung of the message is in its clarity very impressively, and the feeling of the confusingly-ness and the unpredictable-ness that enters mediates at the same time nevertheless, if somewhere once the story moves.
A similar effect obtained ape leak with its team also in fictional scenes (the incorrect film rod on one was based in Teheran).
Too much action on too many places
The director had to explain himself also therewith that the story does not offer actually many scenes exciting in the filmischen sense.
With the few, it works however quite successfully whereby it helps reality sometimes something - what then not always so elegantly causes, (the scenes, in which the threatening crisis on the airport in Teheran of a telephone call in America turned away becomes, or also the pursuit hunt on the runway, cause something gekünstelt).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide dispersion that is stipulated by the necessity of having to show too much at action on too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in its rolls to be sure very charming as Hollywood colleague, its figures would have earned however more room, and therewith they stand in the film by far not alone.
Ape leak film loses through it something at pulling power. It is a film that one pursue with certain interest and can at the same time the formation and the Retro style remembering at a Thriller out of the 70th years goutieren.
It wakes enthusiasm however only heavily.
As a memory of an until piece in certain manner living today story and as a proof its, how the presentations by the almighty and omniscient secret services covered are yet, is it however sufficiently.
