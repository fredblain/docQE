"The brain lets previously only moderate overburden" itself
The technologies modern with followers popular subject of the expanded reality is perceived recently for usually by the lens of some special glasses.
First Google in the summer presented became a functioning model in its annual conference, in November then well known that also Microsoft had registered a corresponding patent.
In the conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, become to be sure clear that the glasses was for the scientists of the business only a run station.
It excites the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Describing you please shortly, which researches your group operates.
- We busy us with the interaction of person and machine, want to expand at the same time however the boundaries of this interaction.
Previously humanity is stick remained chiefly in the phase, in which with pixel on flat screens worked becomes, that are touched sometimes also.
We however 5-10 years want to look ahead and want to anticipate the radical variations of this interaction.
For example the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are is sold a progress, and nowadays no more Xbox without Kinect because all are interested in movement control.
- What expects us yet in the future?
- Although Kinect brought the interaction on a physical plain, much plays itself yet on the flat screen off, sometimes in 3D.
The petition of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the edition previously not yet decisively.
We try to change that, work at real three-dimensional representation systems on the basis of different technologies, under that projection.
We must release the world of computers into our physical world and more tangibly must make it.
In addition it is however required that not only the user is recognized, but rather also its environment.
Then we could supplement the real world much more simply through virtual objects.
And first of all we should become these bescheuerten Virtual-Reality-helmets loose!
- What do you think over language control?
Is you chosen, but it not is overvalued?
- You are not certain the all-purpose solution because it raises questions to the privacy, because one would not like to inform always all next about its actions and intentions.
Each type of interaction with computers is actual good, to be sure each in its certain niche.
For example we worked in the area of the control of objects on public places at a project, with which we experimented with short and tight, instead of with unloading gestures.
At the same time the gestures were not recorded of the object camera, but rather of a bracelet, that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
Yet it is relatively large, could reduce become theoretically however on the size of a watch.
But altogether the future belongs to be sure, for example gestures and language to mixed control types.
- Like that?
Would - we you ask me for example to pass this soda can to you?
They say it and point simultaneously on that.
- Normally I say it simply only.
- Oh, that could be recognized very heavily.
Does - that not be named want, you that the user adapts himself to that, what can perform a machine to the respective moment, and what?
- Unconditionally, but it does not concern here a mutual approach.
I think that we work will must in the near future above all at the development of new sensor types, that enable it to grasp reactions of people more exactly.
For example laser sensors can be that because they offer in the depth a good solution, what is very important.
- Which claims place you coming from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors at modern cameras?
Does it lack at solution, depth or something else other?
- The present generation is in the reason a good starting point for our work in the area of the three-dimensional recognition.
Natural 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
Yet the essential matter the megapixels themselves are not, but rather the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So seen are all present technologies for us not good enough because the developers the algorithms have more work.
Not only the solution must be considered along the X and the Y-, but rather also along the Z axis.
Also the speed and the amount of the pictures per second are important.
The movements of the person are said extremely dynamically and openly, are the present 30 fps especially for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor with a controllable processing delay between 1 to 100 millisecond in our laboratory in speech moon whereby the current commercial sensors lie (60 to 100) more closely at the second value.
Do not understand everyone how very that influences the interaction of person and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly so a device, only without contact control and with more pictures per second.
Would - the amount of the cameras not have to be increased?
- Kinect works presently with three "cameras" whereby one of them is actual an infrared transmitter and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actual an usual RGB camera.
It does not serve to the calculation of the object depth.
More cameras could solve possibly the problem...
Reinforce or the problem because more calculations would be necessary.
A flexible, Kinect similar system, with which we could play with different camera inclinations, would be beautiful in order to assess how that helps us in the three-dimensional ascertainment of a position.
- If I quite would remember, Microsoft did not present in contrast its glasses to Google the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the expanded reality in the everyday life the glasses the best outlooks has?
- Natural it is not comfortable to hold underway always a Smartphone in the raised hand, but I think following: The craziest variant would be a "changing" expanded reality, with which we could shift over a Cloud of the glasses on the Smartphone
The glasses are a personal Gadget and therein its strength (private can only you see) lies prevents, but simultaneously also its weakness, for an expanded reality by means of glasses that you can work jointly with other at virtual objects.
- Places we us a moment long before that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only Tony strongly out of Iron one, but rather also Normalsterblichen.
There is a problem, on which critics of this idea frequently refer: There is no perceptible reaction!
The hands sense generally nothing!
Which answers does your group want to give on this objection?
- In my lectures I speak often therefrom that the expanded reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between person and machine.
I think, the eighth breakthrough could become thoroughly the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is presently the use of the second hand as something projection document unusual.
It takes pressure excellently aware!
There are however also technologies that are aligned actually on that to lend the "pictures in the air" something strong, for example produced the Interferenz of some arranged ultrasound rays in a certain point where the finger is, a feeling, that is momentarily however yet so weak, as someone blew over the hand bales.
There are also volumes for the wrist, that influence on the nerve ending in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
Did - you try, overburden the brain to?
Think let that it senses that, what should sense it, if it sees just something?
- That is a good idea, tried we it not yet.
Here a further task, with which we to fight still have become long, hides, namely a person, who is physically in a closed room, let believe, he would be instead in an open, practically endless room; here we work at drafts with treadmills (other than in fitness studio), mobile platforms as well as large balls.
Previously the brain only moderate can be overburdened, and before us, yet many work rich years lie.
Just that makes the work in the field of the virtual reality for a researcher so dressing: In many subjects, we stand first at the beginning.
