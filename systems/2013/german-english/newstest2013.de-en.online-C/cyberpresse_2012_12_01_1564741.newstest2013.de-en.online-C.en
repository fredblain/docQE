Should prostate cancer early recognition: the test be made or not?
The PSA test wise results defective in the deed sometimes up, with incorrect negative or however also incorrect positive results, that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to stronger hesitation of the already irresolute men for the execution of early recognition tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We overtook the opinion of two specialty physicians.
In the studies carried out in the USA, numerous disruptive influences between the control groups existed so that it is difficult to interpret these data and to give unambiguous recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference exists in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study showed also that in an after observation after 12 years the probability of the development of metastases is 30 to 40% higher around, if no early recognition was carried out.
Therefore I recommend the test from an age of 50 years and/or 40 years if one has a direct relative, who had become ill already with prostate cancer.
With men of afro American origin, a higher risk exists also.
The most important is, to make the correct decision as soon as a cancer disease was recognized.
There are cancer types, that aggressively and other that are indolent.
The size of the risk of its cancer disease really intelligibly must be made the patient in that it the possible options are shown, with which Prostatakrebse untreated can remain, if he does not impair the quality of life in the long run, and decides one in these cases sooner on an active supervision of the illness.
Today takes place at many men, with whom one recognized cancer, no treatment because its cancer is not aggressively and represents no threat for its life.
One proposes them an active supervision and offers in advancing of the illness a treatment to them.
One certainly with increasing accuracy the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who not.
Therefore I recommend nevertheless the execution of the test.
Most importantly it is not however, to speak with its physician, in order to determine whether he should be carried out or.
In collaboration with the international company for Urologie, Movember developed an instrument, with which it is possible to value the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Preventing of the illness
Unfortunately there is no miracle means to the prevention of cancer.
In spite of the progress in the research, the acceptance of a healthy way of life remains the best way in order to diminish the risk, to become ill with it.
It is appreciated that 30% of the cancer diseases could be prevented, if everyone would eat well and would move sufficiently.
"If it no more smoker would give, would become this value at least on 50% increase", emphasizes André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer company.
To be sure is assumed that about 10% of the cancer diseases are caused by transmission.
Several remain also totally unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer company, the battle against the tobacco dependence remains a priority, in spite of the decline of the number of the smoker.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancer types.
The health of the people damages strongly.
"Today yet gives it in Quebec 1.5 million of smoker", regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the renunciation of the cigarette to die diminished itself the risk at cancer around the half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian cancer company, excess weight and Adipositas promote also the outbreak of the illness.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, Grimmdarm-, rectum cancer, esophagus cancer, pancreas cancer and uterus cancer.
"The research shows, that a regular physical activity during the entire life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects", joins it thereto.
The nourishment
The organization recommends also to limit the consumption of red meat.
In to large quantity it increases the risk to become ill with a Grimm- and/or mast intenstinal cancer.
Sausage products should be avoided also.
The preservation of meat through smoking, drying or salts can lead to the development of carcinogenic.
"Latter can the somatic cells damage and to the development of cancer lead", explains it.
Vitamins
In the last years, several scientists examined the context between vitamin additions and cancer.
Your investigations are however presently not conclusive.
After the Canadian cancer company, the studies to vitamin E are contradictory.
While a study found out the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed sooner an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was shown also not yet clearly.
In addition Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is, to speak with its physician over its objections and its informal encumbrance.
"The execution of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer".
