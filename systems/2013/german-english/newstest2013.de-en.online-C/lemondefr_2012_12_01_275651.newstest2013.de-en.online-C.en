"PSG is not the FC Barcelona"!
In this season, you supposed a new size with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Magnificent players came.
Daily I make at its side of progress.
The technical personnel gave me also much.
These elements spur me every day in addition on to improve my game level.
And in a game, this is even simpler.
In the soccer, all goes very quickly.
But I do not break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginning in the center of the preparing education of the INF Clairefontaine to my game time in Saint Etienne, I made always gradually progress.
They take advantage of therefore the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this in the summer are accustomed on that to expedite games of level very high.
They know also that each training unit is decisive.
This leads in addition that a player such as I who must offer forehead and wants to give be best.
By the way gives me Carlo Ancelotti much with regard to my game position.
It is supported of Co trainers such as Claude Makelele, played that on the same position like I.
Is Ancelotti the correct person for the task?
Obvious.
Ancelotti infuses all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is presently no comparable person, and it is among the best trainers of Europe.
It looks back on a rich experience and won many titles with esteemed societies.
It had contact with large players.
I think that it will win further titles in Paris.
In January I led an encouraging conversation with it.
At that time I had recovered just of an injury series.
The confidence that it set in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think over the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the frontrunner.
We lurk however in the ambush.
One our most important goals is qualified us the champions League: we in this manner for the round of sixteen.
What is the goal of the society in this competition?
We will try to come as far as possible.
From now on all is possible.
To be sure we will have to have our little word against very good European teams a say.
First of all we want to become first our group before postage so that we can expedite the return match of the round of sixteen than a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European society on short visibility?
It has already the budget for that...
Around a large European society to become, must win Paris title and make itself long-termed a name.
This is not today the case.
Financially the PSG gives itself the means so that this intention supposes concrete forms.
Would it be a large fiasco to not to win the title in the Ligue 1 how this was in the last season the case?
This would be natural a large disappointment.
This year is far off long us it really at the heart, this title.
In the last season, we were thickly at it.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough, around the victory report therefrom.
We concluded the season with a very strong achievement.
We locked with 79 points.
Normally one should be with 79 points master...
But another team, that of Montpellier, obtained an even better season.
I believe that this year is the correct.
Also if the large teams such as Marseille struggle, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have the thing in addition to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG?
In consideration its, what is invests become and the players whom we have, it is normal that much is expected by us.
We accept that perfectly.
If we win to be sure in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and one finds still something, what one can reproach for us, that with security is somewhat frustrating.
One ask himself, what the people yet expect.
We never could win each weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a game draft.
A team builds up gradually.
In the champions League, we proved strength.
Do not observe Manchester city, a society of that since two seasons creates to qualify for the round of sixteen, and the editions also gigantic handled has!
With regard to the invested sums, one believed you to the game recess with 15 points advantage!
That is that our opponents and the French championship except respect would be let.
Lyon and Marseille, that were not good in the last season, became of this new PSG "geboostet".
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May the smiling victor and say ourselves that we won it in spite of all difficulties in the end.
The PSG seems to be completely of the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic dependent.
All the more better, that one speaks about a "Zlatan dependence".
That is that Ibrahimovic high-performance is and shoots many gates.
Therefore it came and proves it that it is the star of the Ligue 1.
Where it played, it brought to the attention of that it is a magnificent player and a world star.
Within the team, we both the player and the person respect.
It respects also the people who surround it.
What it performed, is really extraordinary.
This spornt the other on to improve its game level.
Thiago Silva, that worldwide one of the best defenders is, enables it all other also to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
How a disappointment.
It lay me at the heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately prevented me my injury on that to knock something game time out.
I saw there things, out of which I followed strengthened.
Today it succeeds me to realize good games in the national team.
This was since my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
Out of that, what happened in the Ukraine, we pulled our apprenticeship, and today we must put an exemplary behavior at the day.
Which opinion do you have to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the tip of the "Bleus"?
It reached very promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strict, stands the players nearly and moves to the victory on.
How it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to engage no comparison.
Blanc had reached its goal in that it had qualified us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does that represent at the 16th of October in Spain forced undecided (1:1) a prelude game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone supported everyone others.
Before this coincidence in Spain, I experienced never a comparable game in my career.
