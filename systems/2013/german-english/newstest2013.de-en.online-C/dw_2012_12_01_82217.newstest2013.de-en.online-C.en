Szabo: "German must play" larger role
Germany abstained from voting in voting over the reception of Palestine of the.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert for US European relations, balances Berlin therewith on a narrow diplomatic degree.
German wave: Beginning of the week had signaled Germany first of all that it would agree against the proposal on an observer status of the Palestinian at the United Nations.
Then however Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support that, what the Israelis in Gaza did.
Now Germany must be careful to be sure based on its special relation with Israel.
But simultaneously I believe that it does not support also the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without to be sure too critically vis-Ã -vis Israel to be.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany abstained from voting also when it went therefore to arrange a flight ban zone.
This was put through in the end of NATO.
Does it fall Germany heavily to relate a clear position in important international subjects?
Yes, that agrees.
That lies that it shifts just its foreign policy and to be sure away of a politics, that became so to speak of the USA gemanaged, there to a German foreign policy.
Impeding arrives that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform politics.
The Germans are found therefore between the fronts against.
One expected of them that they do not play a more independent role, on that are it however accustomed.
I believe, they feel itself yet at its roll up to, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy how they have France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean then concretely from German point of view?
It shows are independent the readiness to relate in national interests also positions, that of which the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, therefore of the exports and its relations to regions, about Russia, China or the Near East determined.
Germany economy interests are to a certain degree unlike that of the other large powers and therefore must Germany its interests protect.
Did these economy interests influence have on the bearing in the Mideast conflict and the voting in the UN?
To the one, Germany has large paragraph markets in the Near East, especially in the gulf countries.
Therefore it must be careful, the public, but also the elite to not to knock in the Arabic countries before the head.
That plays in any case a role.
But I would want to ascribe that also not too much weight, am that no relation one-sided totally.
But it plays in any case an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany damage its relations with the USA in that it abstained from voting in important decisions of, about in the voting over Palestine?
I believe, rule in Europe and even in the USA large understanding for the German position.
Therefore I do not believe that this was a so dramatic breach, like in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will warm up therewith even one certain respect.
For it signals yet that it seriously are taken as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The USA on the other hand talked things out clearly for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?
Based on the American domestic policy, these dissimilarities always existed.
I believe that the government has secretly probably rather much understanding under Obama for the European position.
But based on the political situation here, publicly naturally cannot represent the government this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are all so large not at, how they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and prime minister Netanjahu, Obama is enthused not at all so hellauf of Netanjahus politics.
Does it fall Germany heavily to arrange its narrow relations with Israel and the USA on the one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe, make exactly that it so hard for the Germans.
It would be natural a little simple for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European politics, what presently the case is not.
Therefore they cannot be part of a wider line and must push instead things out of its own position.
They make that just with the Euro.
I believe, will receive Germany in the future a leading roll to press Europe to a European position.
That is naturally not simple for Germany, already because of the relation to Israel.
That was always already a sensitive subject.
But I believe that is clear to the Germans, that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself in the roll see itself as an important international player - wants Germany generally a leading role receive?
Does Germany or fall the leadership role yet heavily and heavily?
Germany is not accustomed yet on that, that is yet always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, falls it the country yet heavily and heavily to play a larger role.
If we look at for example the Euro crisis, there become each time if Germany supposes a larger roll, most varied anti German feelings freely.
That does not make it the Germans simply.
That is actual the old problem: you does not want to surround be of hostile countries.
So seen is Germany in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be impressionable for most varied neighbors and opinions and is that not simple.
Does now the influence of the USA in the European politics not decrease fills remains continuously, that EU this vacuum however, who there in the moment otherwise?
The Germans will have to play simply a larger role.
Also if it does not please them, it them unpleasant is and makes it yet much unpopular - c' est la vie!
