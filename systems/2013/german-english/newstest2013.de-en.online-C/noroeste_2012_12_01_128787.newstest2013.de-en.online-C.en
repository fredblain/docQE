After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a judgment, that does not acknowledge the restructuring of the obligations of the group Vitro, that was reached over a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ill-fated precedent is created for each national business with agencies in the neighboring country, that has payments problems.
One could say therefore that the procedures for the survival of the businesses that allow the Mexican laws have, in the country of the star and Stripes in the contradiction to international come off no validity.
In the practice, that leads issued at the 15th of June recognition of the judgment through the judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas in addition that the Mexican businesses of the seizure of its property helplessly are stopped on the far side of the river Bravo.
To be sure the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico door and gate in order to call inconsistencies because of threefold the uppermost court of the United States.
While the judge of the thing refers on that, that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit with seat in New Orleans says first of all that it concerns in the head procedure the trade bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international collaboration in procedure is not well known in insolvency of business with country spreading profile.
Actually the model law of the United Nations was created to this purpose for the unification of the international commercial law whereby that of American Law institutes was used as simpler.
Secondly the judgment determines that without the voices of the companies after recognition of the obligations in the bankruptcy mass, that had the branch of Vitro with its mother company, the required majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the obligations.
To be sure this possibility is acknowledged of the Mexican laws.
Actual Vitro is not the first case with which this scheme was allowed.
There is a half dozen of example, under that Agremex and Comercial Mexicana whose obligations were confirmed under business of the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (federal institute for trade bankruptcy).
Is correct moreover that after deduction of the voices of the branch the creditors of Vitro, who creditor, who in the courts of the United States against Vitro complained, i.e. the vultures funds such as for example Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and live pool Limited, no majority reached would have.
The voting would have gone out 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not considered of the court of appeal.
On the other hand there is Vitro guilt for its difficult situation from 2008 in the frame of the large economic crisis in the United States, that gave the country of blows.
For this reason the family González Sada inserts contradiction before the same court of appeal so that the voting follows, i.e. from all judges, in the plenum because only three voted therefrom.
Becomes not that granted, is inserted the Cerciorare objection, that demands the examination of the procedure by a higher instance, in this case by the colonel court of the United States.
The serious at this case is that the court let a document aside, that was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), wherein the procedure carried out by Vitro in the frame of the law is described over trade bankruptcy, and is referred wherein on that, that it strictly at that of both countries signed come off held had itself in order to to correspond to the chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
Moreover is referred on that, subjected has, i.e. the determined rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, itself that the country for the international trade, that guarantee the comparison of debtor and creditors, to the principles of the commission of the United Nations.
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
