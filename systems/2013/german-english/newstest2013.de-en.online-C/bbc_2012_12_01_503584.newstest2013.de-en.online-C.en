Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto stands before difficult start
While Mexico of future Präsident Enrique Pena Nieto on its assumption of office prepares itself, analyzed Grant of the BBC wants the challenges impending it and the mixed feelings of its people.
The traffic in Mexico city is current very especially bad.
Even at better days, this is clogged one always city, but on Monday a ring was erected out of steel, that closes off several important traffic route into the capital and provides on the streets for chaos.
It was not the goal however to disturb commuter on the way to the work, but rather to prevent demonstrators on that, to reach the parliament.
On Saturday the president bandage will receive Mexico of new Präsident Enrique Pena Nieto and will receive the leadership of the nation.
It stands before a complex task.
Under the separating government Felipe Calderons, Mexico was able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the handle of a drug war, that cost in the last six years already 60,000 human life.
"My government becomes involved strongly for that, the force to reduce", explained Pena Nieto beginning of this week in the oval Office the US American Präsidenten Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can reach this goal.
Before it went with the US president at eye level, Pena Nieto was as a governor of its homeland country Mexico active.
In this thickly settled, extensive part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions are divided over the new country chief.
A direct man
In the remote town Valle del Bravo, one remembers for example gladly it.
Inhabitants of the vacation place attribute it the development of the tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, one can go on one of the freeways, that let construct Pena Nieto and represent the one large improvement vis-à-vis the brittle, uneven streets, that there was here once.
Badges with its name hang also outside of a modern sport center and an impressive interactive museum to climate change.
"We expect of it real and continuous variations", so its friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, that as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, that PRI works.
We hope, especially, what concerns the security and economy, for an interesting and actual variation, that needs our country so urgently.
After 81 years at the power, the PRI in 2000 of Vicente Fox was removed.
The congresswoman Olvera admits that the party places large expectations after 12 years outside of the president palace of lot Pinos at Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president false it at substance, rejects he.
It would be engaged and would have a very direct man, very large plans for the country.
Let he be an outstanding statesman, above all would be he however also someone, who can listen.
But on the other side of the country, many people do not divide this view over its earlier governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also well known as Ciudad Neza, could be not larger the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo.
The place lies hidden under freeway transfers and places in regard multifarious a suburb of Mexico city even there.
And the problems in the community are of decisively urban nature.
Beginning of this year was turned on the military in order to fight the drug volumes operating in the quarters, and force against women is an especially acute problem.
On a spot fallow in the vicinity of a large dump the corpses dutzender of murdered women were put back alone in the last two years.
While the tenure of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the country Mexico over 1,000 women - a statistics, that exceeds even that of the city Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its force and the murder of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are the view that he is concerned the problem of the woman murders during its tenure at least not appropriate.
Yet in the worst trap, its government had locked its eyes before the problem.
In a concrete building, Irinea Buendia with the tears, typically for the come down quarter, fights when it shows me photos of its deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events according to Mariana committed 2010 suicides.
Yet its family believes that it was murdered by its companion.
"As I in its home arrived, seemed it, as would be its body washed become", remembers Senora Buendia.
There was sign that it was struck, and the rigor mortis already had used.
While its mother tells its story, a picture of Mariana looks of the wall at us down. It is mounted next to a cross, that carries a single word: Justice.
One had forbidden yet exactly this, so the family, its until now.
The authorities treated me, would be as I a Schwätzerin, trouble-maker, grouch.
They would want that one simply accepts its judgment and holds the mouth.
"But that is not possible, if it so many irregularities and failures gave", says it.
If Präsident Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday the president bandage, it accepts therewith also a large responsibility.
Families Mexican ten thousand were affected the last six years by violent crime in, and the new president promised to attend during its tenure especially to this problem.
"I hope, when president is he so, like he as a governor was", says the PRI congresswoman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
Yet exactly before that the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are afraid most.
