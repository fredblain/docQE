Start the course that studies the "end of the world"
Each week the students examine apocalyptic subjects such as for example the atom war, Zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.
Each semester if the religion professor concluded to hold off a course over the end of the world, knew he that he controlled an irresistible hinge hook: the end of the "long backwards counting" of the Maya calendar on the 21st of December, of which many people believed, that it would mean the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea, what should expect it in the following both months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, that some designated as a "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict under participation of Israel, that place, of which the Christian theorists believe, that the apocalypse begins.
"I did not notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester, that it ever gave" said Charmé this week the student at the university Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes, what happened today in the world, as if we would be removed thirty days therefrom, would be this an actual good period.
And it remembers that that is bad good for that with apocalyptic mentality.
And it is not the single professor that this semester offers, that should be actual the last in the story, courses over the "end of the world".
In Temple, the sitting in professor Barry Vacker gives the course "media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week the students examine apocalyptic subjects such as for example the atom war, Zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.
"We analyze, why itself these ideas gradually spread", said it, as well as the type and manner how hypothetical scenarios are offered, that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material arrives into the hands of terrorist, a war could break out for example.
The students analyzed this month films with apocalyptic contents and examined, compare to compare let itself how it in that the actual life.
"I have tries, the students about that to inform, what possible, is probable, plausible and impossible", said Vacker.
On the head campus of the university Pennsylvania the professor formed a team for Latin American story Matthew Restall and its colleague Amara Solari, a sitting in professor for art story and anthropology in order to offer a course with the simple label "the end of the world".
"We take 2012 not up, so that we always the option retain, the course newly hold off to can, for the case, that the world does not sink", said Restall.
In spite of the "impending downfall", the students must study, must generate projects and participate in final exam.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out at the eve of the apocalypse why the students have no other chance, when "to the night to continue work on, where the world nominally to end goes", said Restall.
The courses were chosen very.
"In two hours, there were said no more places" Restall over its course for students with high average, who filled himself with 35 students.
For weeks before beginning of the semester we received e-mails of students that asked, whether yet places would be free.
The students on their part assure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It fascinating is to be seen, what the people do, around itself to comfort", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for religion and sociology out of Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sparkling wine mentality or religion mentality is actually only a question of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student wants to declare Wekesa to be psychology and nursing to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never have I something of an instruction belongs, where this instructed becomes", gave it on.
I enjoy it.
But none of the questioned students - and fewer another professor - explained to believe in the last date of the 21st of December.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayas, and on certain type and manner discredit we it", said Julie Zeglen, student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and out of west Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it concerns only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
It notices in to be sure that in the western company an apocalyptic anxiety exists, that leads back several centuries, when the people on changes in its environment with the prediction of the end of the world reacted.
The Internet increased these speculations.
"Other place think the people not so", says he.
This is main in the english-speaking world the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor of the university La Salle, that this year instructs on the Philippines, answers quickly on the question whether he would know there a course over the "end of the world".
"The Philippines be involved not in the end of the world", wrote it as a hint on an exception of a higher instance.
We have a pardon of the pope.
Restall referred on that that over the years many days was spoken by the last court, and said that if on the 21st of December does nothing happen, "the people immediately at a new date think" or about the fact philosophized that the 21st of December would be the start of a seven year old period, according to what the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they would like to go to celebrations over "the end of the world".
"Perhaps call I a couple of friends on, so that we together laugh can", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
