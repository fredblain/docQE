"Brand-name protection" in China: If Puma and Armani become sudden Chinese
Armani is an universally known brand, Polo Ralph of tepids also.
What is however Armani Polo?
Behind it a label very officially registered in China, that has to do to be sure nothing with the origin businesses, hides.
Nevertheless it enjoys so long protection how the actual name givers do not complain.
And even then is not clear whether they get right.
"It becomes more and more for foreigner more difficult, its brands in China to protect", says Thomas stalemate hole, lawyer in the office Taylor Wessing who is specialized on protection breach of the law in the far east.
A new case lands each week on my desk.
The imitators rich letters additional already a couple so that they may register its brands.
So will let register out of Gucci simple Lu Gucci, instead of Prada one Prada Kny.
Also German businesses are copied in this manner legal, about the sport article manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a file with entries of the brand-name office in Beijing.
On the 14th of September 2010, a Chinese business the trademark Zegna DF Puma let protect there, an art name that made use of also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champion in the copying and in the injured of intellectual property, is well known.
In the large cities, there are multistory department stores that sell almost excluding forgery.
Stalemate hole of cases however are differently: On behalf of its clients, it advances on the other hand that Chinese business of the brand-name office receive very officially the right to use a label, that is protected already elsewhere.
The Chinese name that "anxious Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word orients itself towards "anxious Dakuan".
Therewith women are meant, who catch rich men.
The Chinese authorities are themselves no guilt aware
"That is geschäftsschädigend, one must it fight", demands stalemate hole.
"The brand is diluted, that disappears all attitude, the image damage is enormous".
The financial losses and the process costs of the concerned industries go into the millions, above all in expensive show products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion is Euro in the year the third largest market for luxury article and the at the fastest growing.
Yet cancellations of suspicious entries in the brand-name index are to be reached and are to be gotten heavily expensive.
Up to nine years, the procedure can move itself, with uncertain exit.
Stalemate hole reports of cases, in which the court complaints rejected, because after the long duration of that name objected to become would be the "market reality".
If the complainant would have bad luck, he had to pay the plagiarist even money because he injured its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases concern also graphic elements.
Daimler lost 2009 a lawsuit with the building machine manufacturer Sany, that business that recently the German concrete pump farmer plaster master received.
The Chinese may use therefore until today an emblem, that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue white Logo that reminded one of BMW; the dispute became had to change geschlichtet, Geely it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitator from Hong Kong and Singapore that the famous crocodile let view into the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are themselves no guilt aware.
The brand-name office CTMO in Beijing admits to be sure that it had given there 2010 because of to slight personnel equipment and room equipment bottlenecks.
In the past year, one would be returned" however of the "need situation in the work flow to the normality.
So the existence of unfinished objection procedures had sunk around 22 percent.
One had locked almost 57,000 of such cases, 75 percent more than in the preceding year.
Nevertheless wait in the office of still 81,500 objections for settlement.
To concern on the other hand much costs
How so often in China the numbers are impressively.
In the past year, more went in the CTMO than 1.4 million proposals on brand-name protection on, almost one-third more than 2010.
Let a record be that and mean that China would cite for the tenth time sequentially the list of the new registrations in the world, divides the authority with.
That applies also to the existence of all valid trademarks, altogether 5.5 million pieces.
2011 had been taken in 1.8 billions of Yuan at fees.
Simplified that is named that each registration costs on average 1280 Yuan or 160 Euro.
To concern on the other hand a multiple costs how the case of the German family business joy mountain shows.
Since more than seven years, the group against a Chinese plagiarist fights.
To be sure the Germans were able to reach that its illegal fabrication imitated motor vehicle part was excavated.
Yet the imitator secured himself further the Chinese rights at the brand joy mountain.
One himself would have that neglects because in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairperson of the management of joy mountain Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand-name office CTMO rejected the objection of the citizens of Munich then also.
In the next both instances joy mountain got to be sure quite, but the process opponent fights until today further.
One must pay attention infernal
Now the matter is pending before the colonel court.
Wentzler is confidently, to bring the thing to a good conclusion, and the professionalism of the courts praises.
But it says also: "The procedure is extremely costly and costs us much time, money and nerve".
The internal costs let do hardly number themselves, the firm archive had to look through even one hundred year acts old in order to furnish proofs.
Five years ago joy mountain of the opposite side offered in vain a "high six-figure Euro sum" to the settlement.
"On that sees one, like much us that is valued", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the far east threaten slosh back even to Europe.
If there imitators secure themselves unprotected brands.
So a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the label joy mountain for shoes and leather.
The group abandoned this business field a long time, nevertheless it was able to turn away the registration.
"One must infernal pay attention", says Wentzler.
Both it and the lawyer stalemate hole advise German business in addition to be in businesses with China very careful.
Do not suffice should to depend on international brand-name rights, rather the foreigners "all, what somehow is worthy of protection, also in China register" how Wentzler says.
Otherwise that can become much more expensive than the registration.
In the deed: If joy mountain would be subject in the last act of its brand-name drama, one would have to pay probably the opposite side license fees for the own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pressed in the questionable segment out of the market.
