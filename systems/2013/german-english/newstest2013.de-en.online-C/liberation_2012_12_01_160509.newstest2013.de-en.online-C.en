Before just a week, the country chief had granted this plenum two additional months for the conclusion of its works.
Egypt has relied now for almost two years on a preliminary, repeatedly altered text, what weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal disorder.
This new initiative provided only for an even stronger split of the country.
For its opponents, the president in its persists "autocratic delirium" in that he breaks" further "its word and "the right with feet steps".
