My Mexican American identity crisis.
Many people would be forced based on the missing chances to left Mexico
Mexican tend in addition to accuse the emigrants - it call them difficult times into the memory, says he
Navarrette is the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On one recently trip after Mexico city I had crossed and had arrived just recently the hall at the passport inspection when helplessness in me extend made itself.
Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").
I stood there some seconds long, unsteadily, to which I should proceed me.
I grew up in headquarters California and was named my entire life long "mexican".
An ethnic shorthand symbol - exactly so how my friends in Boston "Iren" or my friends in New York name themselves "Italian".
Later I decided on "Mexican American".
But that here was Mexico.
And in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no requirement after shorthand symbols or dash.
I was simply only American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough in order to maintain myself in this language at both ending of an interview.
But I do not control the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I become not my American accent either loose.
Therefore I took my American passport and stood into the snake for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment of this week when the future Mexican Pr√§sident Enrique Pena Nieto visited the white house in order to meet with president Obama.
On the agenda, all those subjects that one expects stood, if the heads meet both countries: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was interested also very on that to speak over the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that mexican remain nowadays with just as high probability in Mexico instead of emigrating into the United States.
He would like to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block after example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drugs cartels, also if it named relating to this no details.
Mexico relation to the United States is complicated and full resentment.
Most Americans never waste probably a single thought that the United States in 1848 in Mexico occurred and forced the leadership of the country under reproached weapon in addition to leave more than the half of its territory to them.
But for mexican, who do not think in centuries and in minutes, memories of not to are surveyed this event.
As soon as therefore a US government official practices criticism also only mildest of Mexico, one - in the Mexican press and under the elite of the country - hears troubles about how the Americans oppress the sovereignty of its neighboring country.
And the children Montezumas proceed on the war path.
And yet the largest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relation with the more lies than 35 millions Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Speak desire to over resentment?
There are more than enough.
Winner and loser has Mexico. People for whom the country chances offers, and other for which it does not do this.
The single reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles live, read Vegas, phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, exists therein that at a point in our pedigree a person - perhaps a parents parent or large parent - got offered no chance in Mexico and emigrated toward north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - swarthy, uneducated, out of a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithful counts them.
Not Mexico.
And although we live perhaps now the American dream, good schools visits and receive have good jobs, may lose live we never out of the eyes that it is the American dream, that we - not the Mexican.
Our identity blurred sometimes if possible, but what concerns our loyalty, this is not the case.
This counts unambiguously the United States.
In addition we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class do not like us.
This is based upon mutuality.
They see us as a memorial of a humbling defeat and view on us down because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish never will be good enough, our volumes to Mexico never strong enough.
According to your opinion our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families were not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not be caught see ourselves now behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but yet somehow lost.
My wife, who were born in Guadalajara and immigrated as a child legal into the United States, remembered that between mexican and Mexican Americans tensions exist, because mexican possess a clearer presentation about that, who it are me - and Mexican Americans take them this vile.
While she is US American citizen, she sees herself as a part of these countries.
To belong yet many Mexican Americans whom I know, have the feeling, neither to the one yet to the other country.
We love the Mexican volumes lot Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys is the best of both worlds, but in none of them rooted.
In Mexico, we are seen as American.
And in the United States, we are seen as a mexican.
How I should learn during my trip, there is makes something, that this relation yet more complicated: Some Mexican leadership people and parts of the development citizenship would like to receive its connections to the Diaspora again.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, that represent its interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleague therefrom how crazy a visit of this country is and exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify its ties to Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unjust distribution of income, the unbridled corruption and the drug force many of us are certain not at all so whether it concerns really a crazy country.
I fear, must there its alone through, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some mexicans are not yet ready, to forgive the United States for the contact with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept also that some Mexican Americans cultivate a grudge, how its members of the family were treated first before not at all so long time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are thought "More mexican", than I.
