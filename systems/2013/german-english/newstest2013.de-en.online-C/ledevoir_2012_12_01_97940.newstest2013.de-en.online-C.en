To die palliative care - the best way... | Le Devoir
With its from shot for "dying in would become" has Quebec recently the delicate question the end of life discusses.
The debate must be received briefly again although a bill is prepared.
To be sure yet much to do remains in this important subject area.
Le Devoir tried to observe this more closely.

"You gave me five years to live, I have seven years created", said it half-hearted, in its bed in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil lying, in which it had arrived on the day before.
"To be sure is it always a shock, on that can one not prepared be", says it.
The illness makes its work: an immense weakness prevents it on that, however to go on the toilet and to eat even even.
At the table before a delicious lunch sitting, willigt he resigns on to be helped in the meal.
Courageous it succeeds to smile it even and bring offer to speak with the strange, that are busied around it around, its medicines, and it a bath to it.
The courage of the usual death.

A few hours later the team found a remedy for this evil.
"In the course of our life learn we, that a man in the standing pees", tells Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home Victor Gadbois.
To return into the childhood phase an unacceptable humiliation is for certain people.
"That hangs of the capacity of the person from" to accept a setback, places it firmly.
For in the opinion of several people that work in the palliative care, large events take place in the middle of this setback.
The patients, who are instructed into the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, suffer all from cancer.
They have a maximal life expectancy of three months.
In this stage, they will bombard of the physicians and nurse, who attend to it, no longer with so named "healing" cares.
For woman A., 89 years,, the worst fear is, to die "deliberately and through asphyxiation".
But through the illness, I have really know learned my children.
"I have good children", joins it thereto.
"I have no more wishes in life", says it before it accepts, that one mounts it a costume, that helps its in the breathing.
It expects in the next days nevertheless another last visit of its son that comes from Italy.
In the home Victor Gadbois, one offers body care and aid position with a group of volunteer in the nourishment reception.
The palliative care is used then if it gives no more other possibilities.
In order to form the dying more comfortably.
In Quebec, a bed comes on 11,700 inhabitants for the palliative care.
That is very few if one are considered, that we will die one day everyone.
Here life is continued under optimum conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on plain of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One grants the dying according to wish a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics must control its blood-sugar level no longer.
And death is part of the everyday life.
We served yesterday evening Mr. X a beer, that died in the course of the night.
Today morning will be finish son the beer on foot the deceased.
"We help member and patients likewise", reports care director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor Gadbois, no day is such as the other.
Next to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is supported well of its pillows, while one activates to its honors, dies a young man of 36 years, that is surrounded by his parents, his wife and both small children, in tragic manner after he tried everything in order to survive.
"Since six months are three to five beds always with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years covers", divides disturbs Dr. Christiane Martel with.
53% of the patient instructed into the home Victor Gadbois come come by its accustomed site, 47% out of the hospital.
Problem of the access to the palliative care
One says, have, i.e. to a care, that 77% of the Canadians no access to the palliative care, that should mitigate the suffering of patients, if latter the final stage of its life reached, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, like the home Victor Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative care in the greater Montreal area specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this large insufficiency in the health provision of Quebec provides that several physicians specialized in the palliative care of the dismissal of a law to the regulation by medically assisted suicide and assisted suicide with objection expect.
For the month of October a manifesto in the circulation, that of prominent personalities of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe became signs, has been in order to manifest its contradiction to such an initiative.
Dr. according to Christiane Martel the health system of Quebec is not efficient enough in order to guarantee that all rights have on a qualitatively high-value palliative care, before one accepts to pass over to the medically assisted suicide.
Recently, says it, I saw a patient, who was 14 days with large pain in the emergency ward, without that one seized measures to its relief.
I fear that the patients want to die only therefore, because they receive no appropriate health provision.
And simultaneously several oncologists treat stifled its patients in spite of worst prognoses to the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when it interrupted an onerous chemotherapy.
When I announced my Onkologin, that I will interrupt the treatment, it answered me that it would regret, that I abandon the battle, told it.
To be sure it had said to me that I would be at the end!
No omnipotente care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients to die asked have, that, that care personnel thank, that it did not grant this wish, after its pains were mitigated of a team of the palliative care.
It must be said however clearly that the palliative care is not in the pain treatment omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, leader of the palliative care of the company the domestic palliative care of the greater Montreal area do not address 8% of the patients on a pain treatment.
Entirely at the end of life, the physicians fall back therefore frequently on the terminale sedation, that runs out on that to put to sleep the patient either sporadic or durably until at the time its death.
We cannot do more long so as if we do not perceive this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will have always more frequently the possibility to fall back on this terminale sedation.
Patients whose pains are not mitigated say all the same sentence: "I want to die".
But that does not mean inevitably, "I wants, that you me put to sleep", but rather "I would like that my pains become" mitigated.
The realization of this report was possible based on a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
