Drink daily butter - and 168 years old become
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country in which 97-year-olds are yet comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country in which 97-year-olds are yet comparatively young.
The trip through the Talysch mountains is to be named wild romantic.
The small bus rumbles over the winding street, past at thickly wooded hills, tearing rivers and simple farmer houses.
Everything is green and juicy, one could mean, one would be in the Black Forest.
The deepest south of Azerbaijan, the boundary to the Iran is is removed yet that here only a few kilometer.
Here the caucasian ethnic group of the Talyschen of which much well known is not lives, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserisch and is very durable.
Terminal is Lerik.
The small village shows off with to mightily advised architecture out of Soviet times, that wants to fit so not at all into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe come is conveys hardly here, to onerously that of Azerbaijan capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, one needs eight hours because the street is only single-track.
The incredible wealth, that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian sea, did not arrive here in the province yet.
Yet Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the thing to the tourist attraction.
"Baku became in May with the Euro vision-song-festival famously - and in the next year have we here a festival of the oldest people of the world", says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen is documented out of the area, that shows more old than 100th Fatulayeva on a black-white-photo.
That here is my grandfather, he became 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years another child witnessed
Yet disputed star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Müslümov that 168 years is supposed to have become old.
There is not a birth document to be sure.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who became 122 years old, Müslümovs age appears yet extremely doubtfully.
"1805 became it here in the region born, 1973 died it", clarifies Fatulayeva.
The man would be married been three times and had had 23 children, should have witnessed at the age of 136 years he another daughter.
Did Müslümov reckon itself therefore in its age around a couple of decade?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of the Hochbetagten in means Asia.
"Incidentally many highly old would jut people gives it also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "also in Sardinia live extremely many very old men".
Because of missing documents, no scientific proof is to be led however over the age especially since Personenstandsregister were missing.
Butter goblet wise melted every day
Fact is however that the people of the region reach all around Lerik incidentally frequently a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are older than a 100 years.
Why do therefore so many Hochbetagte live here in the south?
The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva on the other hand believes that it would lie at the nourishment.
Yet that calculated so healthy be should the food of high-calorie the Talyschen, appears that meat, bread and above all milk products of dear and, of which many drink daily a glass of melted butter, out of nourishment scientific visibility also not exactly plausible.
Is it or the original way of life that the people young holds? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement close to the city Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is extend for this yet comparatively young.
Mirzayeva that maintains to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wood house, that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It sits on the ground with a churn, that rolls here it indefatigably there and.
Eight people live are here under a roof, under that one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both a long time grandparents.
Also two infants jump around.
In the kitchen, one prepares the guests tea that is served in that typical, belly-shaped Armadu glass.
Teeth white Mirzayevas stand conceals perfectly in row and limb, under its scarf it long, dark blond braids that its son reveals proudly before us.
I washed my hairs always with milk, went it myself never from and retained its color.
"Shampoo have I also never uses", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension passes for life
It ate always only that, what came of its own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I long did not buy my entire life a single time in the supermarket groceries.
Then it tells of its man, who was in the army.
Most badly it was at the time after the second world war.
Yet everything became received better, than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew the oar.
The propaganda sounds strangely out of the mouth of an old woman.
Yet the cult, that is driven around the father figure of the nation, that be reigned country such as a dictator, knows hardly boundaries in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, it was received at the power, later its son Ilham the oar.
Nevertheless there is no need under Azerbaijan of old.
230 Manat (about the same sum in Euro), receives Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for local ratios a sum of which one can live well.
And perhaps also Mirzayevas has a long time grayed son quite: "The old enjoy respect" in our culture.
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, umsorgt and are happy.
If that is no reason to remain as long as possible alive
