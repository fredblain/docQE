In a permanently galvanizeed world, it is beautiful, also to be bored once
This Thanksgiving spent I unexpectedly five hours in the airport when our airplane out fell based on mechanical problems and we on another flyer wait must.
I had therefore enough time in order to make myself a couple of thought to boredom.
I do not want to lie.
To wait a half day at the airport for a flight, is rather nerve-rackingly - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and naturally tax free shopping) are available.
But more and more academician and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
If it goes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be occasionally bored.
Therewith the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting reasonings, what promotes if possible creativity.
And because that of us stare nowadays almost permanently on that on or other screen, benefit us the advantages of the boredom no longer.
Should we welcome the boredom therefore with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
On that I return once again.
How many people also I assumed always that boredom of a relatively current phenomenon is, that developed with increasing leisure time.
Yet Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and Roman story at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of "bora cathedral: A Lively History" (Yale University of press, 2011) that sees not so.
"Actually has the boredom of a very long story", says it.
A Latin graffiti adorns the house walls of Pompeii over boredom, that is due to the first century.
And then yet the question is there how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of the psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada according to the problem exists therein that boredom was defined and discussed on types multifarious.
After long reading material of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Eastwood and its colleagues to the end came professor that boredom as the experience, "a satisfying activity exercise to want, this however to can" cannot be defined.
Boredom differs of apathy consequently indicating that the person is not busied, this however be would like.
In the apathy on the other hand there is no pressure to do something.
The key experience of the boredom, says it, would exist in an "interference of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling, that the time only slowly passes".
Boredom can sound therewith almost so like depression.
But professor Eastwood believes although both conditions in context stand could, see bored people the problem in its environment or the world while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that is boring us, also if we have merely difficulties to concentrate.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining bora cathedral in Terms of Attention" - to German about: "The idle intellect: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention", that appear in September in the trade journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", wise professor Eastwood and its colleagues on an earlier experiment there, with which participants listened a volume, on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program out of the neighboring room, that had to do nothing with the contents. Others heard it on low volume so that it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly audible television, indicated to perceive more boredom than the two other groups - it had problems to concentrate, were able to find and wrote no reason for this its difficulties of the boredom to.
If one tries to concentrate on a difficult or strenuous task, the interference of the attention to boredom can lead, says mark J. Fenske, associated professor for neurosciences at the university Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If one exercised on the other hand a monotonous activity - "so like the search for defective products on a factory conveyer belt, music can distract and help at the same time to not to feel" bored.
Actually, so it says, know even fight can we now that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln interprets, often as a sign for boredom, this in that people remain physically more attentively.
"Studies showed, that children, that herumhampeln may, more learn and more information retain than that, that for sitting still forced become", so professor Fenske.
All becomes us at some time or another boring - my belated flight, a roaring loudspeaker, an especially tiring film.
But some people bore themselves more easily than other.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980 developed years a "scale to the boredom susceptibility".
On the scale, statements such as "many things that I must do be found repeat, themselves and are have monotonous" and "I so many interests that I have not" enough time for everything.
With the help of such scales, researchers found out, becomes that boy more often boring as a girl, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the university west Florida - especially, what concerns the requirement after more and a larger variety of external attractions.
But in general teenagers are a rather exhausted pile.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment carried out contacted, in that he almost 400 teenagers and its parents seven to eight times at the day with a Pager.
It found out that 32% of the growing up were bored in the school and in the settling of the homework, whereas 23% indicated to be bored if they were not in the school.
Yet only 3% of the parents indicated to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he would not know whether the percent shares climbed or sunk with respect to the boredom.
Let he be certain however that "the youth as especially boring perceived becomes", mainly, because children and teenager have no large influence on its everyday life flow.
Back therefore to my origin question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, for in the extreme case it does not lead in addition that people take extreme physical risks on itself and decay the gamble or drugs to mitigate around it - that showed studies.
On the other hand many philosophers and authors examine the relation between boredom and creativity. Professor Vodanovich, that the subject investigates since more than two decades, is this opinion.
"With the boredom wants the brain one say, that one something else do should", so Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not know always, what one should do just best.
If one boringly is and one this energy uses in order to play and to cook guitar, becomes one happy.
Yet television can provide to be sure short-termed for feelings of happiness, these evaporate long-termed however again.
He, who passes therefore an iPad to its bored child, can divert it therewith to be sure of the boredom. It did not learn therewith however to conversed or to control, says professor Fenske.
And it adds: "Self-control transfers itself of a situation to the other".
The child learns not only to converse, but rather more self-control receives also in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Also we should not see it to critically.
Instead our goal should exist therein, well should feel us also to one side of the permanent activity irrigation and technology irrigation.
Professor Eastwood agrees that.
"It sounds so, as would have to be more often boring us. But boredom is the tormenting, unceasing wish to do something meaningful", says it.
It believes that the people in truth search only for a way, to disengage and to relax.
"In an environment, in which we permanently are stimulated over, to busy is difficult for it, itself if the noise is" upset once.
