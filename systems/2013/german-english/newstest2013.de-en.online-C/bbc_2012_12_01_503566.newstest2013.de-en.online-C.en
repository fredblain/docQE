Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the most smelly fish of the world?
One of the highest standard of living enjoy the five million inhabitants of Norway - and that not only in Europe, but rather in the entire world.
Could the success secret of the country have to do something with the local appetite for rather smelly fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese sorts.
Place it in the middle of a pile more dirtily, damp sport clothing.
It and leaves there a week.
So approximately one must imagine the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the large delicacy of Norway.
I am removes in the small city Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo.
There is here snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that not simply wants to disappear.
Rakfisk is best regretted fermented becomes with salt trout, that - dependent on, like stink one its fish gladly would have - to a year in water.
If in Norway the darkness comes over the country and becomes the weather colder, stream norwegian to a festival here in Fagernes, that is dedicated this, now, to really very bribing specialties.
"One eats it raw and rinses it then with a glass of aquavit down", says Havard Halvarsen, that works actually in the local fire watch, but as a so-called "Rakfisk general" also the festival arranges.
Around us around people consume fish cubes small and take in addition large quantities at alcohol to itself.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk", says Havard.
The Spirituose can displace the smell.
I cost some morsels.
If one avoids it to bring the Rakfisk in nose vicinity, it is not bad - about like Sushi, that has a quite long bus trip behind itself.
Rakfisk is the product of an entire other, by far poorer Norwegian epoch when there were yet no cool possibilities and fish in the autumn in airtight brine casks was soaked.
In the deepest winter, it was taken out then after long Fermentierung and - undoubtedly under with the help of senses softened by alcohol - was consumed.
Before a generation saw cable would send himself norwegian in search of work forced to leave its country and hiked mainly into the USA from.
Today the population are awake rapid - more than 13% are immigrant, lured of a flourishing labor market, high wages and a comprehensive public health.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, that by far pass was as Norway before not yet all too long time, stream immigrant.
Rakfisk is looked at as something important - as an essential if also exertally smelling part of the Norwegian story.
It belongs to the more expensive courts, that one can buy himself here.
But actually is here yes all expensively - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 Euro.
Norway does not create it often into the world press, and that does not seem most people to disturb.
Here one hates to name it still, differently Breivik in the name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot last year 77 of men, women and children.
Instead one has reference only to the "occurrence of the 22nd of July".
Norwegian have trouble therewith, to accept that someone is capable in its peace-loving country to such brutal murders.
Mainly responsible for the current wealth of Norway the growth of one of the largest oil industries and gas industries is since the early '1970's the world.
"But oil is not the single reason, why it us so well goes", says Anna, our waiter, the round trays with ripe Rakfisk distributes and ideally embodies with its long blond hair and the pricking blue eyes the Nordic.
We are a - how says one - circumspect people.
Your English is exact like that of the most people here immaculate.
We are not very ostentatious, we like no bragging.
Norway very carefully handled its oil wealth - a large part of the industry yields will invest to the welfare of future generations into a special fund.
When in the years to the world economic crisis all with money threw around itself, that it not at did all possess, held locked Norway its money stock exchange firmly.
"As long as we in the winter ski go and in the summer hike go can, are we happy", says Anna.
"And naturally Rakfisk eat", joins it with unencumbered laughing thereto.
I stand in the snow and stand for another court at - of Rakfisk have I enough.
Such a moose castle is in any case something else. The juicy meat mundet me.
But in the evening again the stink fish stands on the menu.
The hotel in which I room is one of several venues, who organize a Rakfisk Dinner, with which guests can agree for the best - or perhaps the senses of smell of at the strongest demanding - fish.
There is a live-TV-control to a Showmaster clothed with fly that is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Euro vision song Contest.
"Which score do you have there above in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"
"Here our points, Havard" are.
One klatscht and laughs.
A man falls overwhelms of its chair, possibly of the aquavit.
But perhaps it is yet the severe vapor of the entire fish.
