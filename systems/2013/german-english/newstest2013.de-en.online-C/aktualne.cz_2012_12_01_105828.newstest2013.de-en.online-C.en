NKÚ boss: Inspection of the black system fails through get into debt of the politics
The Czech Republic controls in the context with public orders good control instances and appropriate laws, falls however into its application back.
In the conversation for this says the vice president of the highest control office (Nejvyšší kontrolní NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it correctly must be used - and this is in my opinion here not the case", comments on Kala the current situation.
To a similar result, apparently also a joint inspection comes through Czech and German inspectors.
As a negative practice example, it leads the attitude of prime minister Petr to that so-called. "Blackly system" on.
Did recently the prime minister say that the ODS the entrepreneurs not would annoy with inspections - is the system therefore now forbidden or permits?
"A law must yet its validity have, and if somewhat legally forbidden is, can yet not simply the government chairperson come, and the control office, whose duty now once the inspection of the compliance of the law is, in its activity hinder", places Kala firmly.
On the session of the control committee of the delegate chamber, you spoke over a joint Czech German project, in whose frame the laws of both countries were compared regarding public orders together.
About what did it go there concretely?
Test with which we began about two years ago concerns at the same time a parallel.
Simplified said, goes it therefore that the European legislature determines, how public orders are to be handled. On that the single national legislations construct. And in the end there is yet the actual practical application.
We compared this everything together, and although the test is not locked yet, we were able to assess extremely interesting differences. Generally said, are is the laws here perhaps even something else "severe and more perfect", the actual application however in Germany in some parameters better.
Therewith is confirmed that it does not pass to set up again and again new and more exact rules. One must concern himself also with the actual application the to the right.
To what extent can the project be you an aid? What results for you from this project?
Just such a joint inspection could contribute in addition that we stop striving us permanently around a Perfektionierung of the laws and the decline and Austarierung of threshold values if this not especially positively has an effect evident.
Economics means to not to acquire a thing to a sensible price (what always the lowest price is) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or quite criminal actions.
But the decline of threshold values for orders does not guarantee that we reach this goal also.
Perhaps it is even so that we burden the system in this manner only with excessive "paperwork", and that that seek spaces in the system more simply have, it substantially to exploit the system as if the threshold values remained higher.
They speak over the problems in the practical conversion of the Czech award law.
How does the control system in Germany function?
Are there here a similar authority such as our NKÚ, or the system functions differently?
What the authorities concerns, similarly is constructed is the German counterpart to the NKÚ the federal board of audit, that like here and also over a council ordered, that is formed solely somewhat differently. Basically both authorities work however similarly.
Also the competences are to one certain mass comparably whereby Germany is however a state, i.e. that there are these boards of audit also in the single states - therein differs the German system of our.
The BRH may control only federal means, what corresponds to our national means.
Public means, that are administered here by the districts and communities, are subject there the inspection of the country boards of audit.
What concerns the German legislation, is that simpler than our?
Generally I would compare this without concrete statements only unwillingly. Nevertheless Germany in certain regard is designated often as an example whereby one not however certainly can say, that Germany in all is better.
Does that lie perhaps that there the inspectors are better?
That does not determine said, but how: I do not like such comparisons especially gladly.
To this yet is to be noticed in that also those countries that are for us an example have to fight also with problems.
Would otherwise they not have yes nothing of a collaboration with our authority, aware?
What concerns the Czech legislation, which meaning the amendment of the award law had for your authority, sense already any effects?
In consideration its that this novel is first short time effective, has an effect it in our tests until now not yet.
Because our inspections retroactively take place, one must here with one certain delay calculate.
We perceive obviously will have an effect effects sooner in the preparation phase of future inspections - so have we the new control instrument "recognition of risks of the uneconomical-ness" introduced and with this almost 14,000 public order tested and analyzed - here until now the changes because the threshold values change themselves, the conditions for certain types of announcement modified became among other things
Do you see the dismissal of this law sooner positively, or the system with further bureaucracy is burdened?
I think, determine is that this law a step into the correct direction and hope that this acceptance is confirmed.
It can appear however the problem that the rules become "more severe" and can be kept no longer.
Already under the prior rules, that of a test are subjected people vis-à-vis the carrier (for example, in the case a grandpa rational program of the regional politics, that regional advice) indicating account compulsory that each non-observance of the award law of an injury matches the household discipline.
Is it then however meaningful to make the law yet more severe?
In my opinion not in this manner.
The system must exclude those, must punish, that want to attack and abuse the system, and not those, that committed an irregularity, that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system pressures solely the bureaucracy even larger.
Where is the exit here?
Let's say first of all once, whom way is not goal leading.
The prime minister said recently that the ODS the entrepreneurs not with inspections the so-called. Would "blackly system" behelligen become - what is named that exactly?
Is the black system forbidden now or is permitted?
A law must have yet its validity, and if somewhat legally forbidden is, the government chairperson can come hinder yet not simply, and the control office, whose duty is now once the inspection of the compliance of the law, in its activity.
It can say: "We change the law and permit the thing", but it cannot say that we do so, as if would nothing be.
The award law contains relatively severe rules over the formal execution of certain processes - and that is also correct for the protection of the public competition.
On the other side, it is however also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded alone on the basis of irregularities.
The law never will be perfect, but correctly must be used it - and that is that what is missing here in my opinion.
