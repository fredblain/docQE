World Aids day: Tramp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland are happy Aids orphan about that.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First the tramping is there: Cowboy boot, basketball shoes, lady pump and Herrenslipper seek the tact on the parquet ground, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then first the voices of the singers swell slowly at - old, bass, tenor and soprano - oppress, betören and pursue themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, lifts it almost out of its material shoes if he brings together it with its pliant wild gestures.
It is rehearses Monday evening, in the music room of the institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi a new song.
At the fifty singers and singer came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin to the house man.
"Om' Obani" no simple piece, each choir voice is still has another text and this also in a very strange language: Zulu that is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts by Swaziland.
Aid to the self-help
Worldwide there is appreciates approximately 34 million HIV infected, that Unaids, the program of the United Nations to the Bekämfung of Aids.
23.5 million people therefrom live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 Aids orphans live.
More than 40 percent of the population are in the meantime HIV positive.
For 180 Aids orphans in the village Esitjeni, the society found Voices for Africa godfather in Germany.
70 of them visit a continuing school.
For 15 or 20 Euro per month, one can receive a godfather shaft.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means on Zulu story narrator or also praise prices.
The Bantusprache fluently speak can no one in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years the choir of songs in this strange soft language has practiced and diverts it and at also there back where they originally come: into the south of Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies of Heidelberg removes, in the northwest of the kingdom Swaziland, gives it the village Esitjeni that depends on the voice force of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live are there, many yet in simple clay cottages and straw cottages, a large part therefrom children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents because these are succumbed the HI virus.
In Esitjeni appears in the small on what entirely Swaziland suffers: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the masculine foreskin, that diminish the contagion risk demonstrably around the half, are hardly supposed of the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry is the immunodeficiency virus in itself to die with middle thirty no rarity.
In a joint Africa trip in the spring 2005 discovered the choir the village, above all however saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, which it lacked not only at parental care, but rather simply at all: Eat, clothing, development.
Without diploma, one has no chance in a poor country first quite.
Originally it was yet the private engagement more single to send for a couple of Euro in the year a child to the school and to enable it a warm meal at the day.
The choir later established yet already a year the society "Voices for Africa" that attends since then almost professionally to the Aids orphan in Esitjeni.
Facts to sexually transferable infections
What are the most important sexually transferable illnesses?
To the bacterial STI, syphilis, Chlamydien and Tripper (gonorrhea) count.
Frequent viral STI are HIV, humane Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and Krätze belong to the parasitical STI.
Who are the main party concerned groups?
Syphilis and Tripper occur above all with men, who have sex with men.
The Robert-cook-institute assumes that at least four are transmitted by five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany by sexual contacts between men.
At the heterosexual adults, Chlamydien infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (fungus), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren are frequently occurring sexually transferable illnesses.
The distribution of HIV is in this country comparatively slight under heterosexual adult - nevertheless: Approximately 20 percent of the HIVS new infections fall to this group.
Under youth, Chlamydien infections step substantially more frequently on than in other population groups.
After European elevations, three-quarters concern people young all infections between 15 and 25 years.
In this country humane Pappilomaviren occur moreover with youth frequently.
How did the number of the infections develop?
All sexually transferable illnesses are not reportable.
The number of the syphilis infections has according to the Robert-cook-institute of 1697 diseases per year 2001 on 3698 diseases per year 2011 more than doubled itself.
The number of the HIVS new infections has returned since 2007.
There were 2011 approximately 2700 cases.
That is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
Which symptoms refer to a venereal disease?
The infectious diseases can evoke abscesses in the genital area, troubles in the Urinieren, outflow, lower stomach ache as well as blister or wart.
Often they cause however no pains or other symptoms and remain therefore unseen.
How can one protect himself?
Condoms can decrease the risk of a contagion, offer however no hundred percent protection.
For in part pathogens can be transmitted by sexually transferable illnesses also by grease infections and narrow body contact.
Therefore experts recommend above all regular investigations with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed most STI can healed and long-term consequences avoided become.
Through godfather shafts, contributions and not finally the salaries, that itself the choir throughout Germany ersingt, meets a few things.
"Altogether have we already round 200,000 Euro after Esitjeni sent", says Annette Lennartz, the chairperson of the society.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and execution strong woman, the moneys administers from Germany.
It is concerned also therefore that the orphans find accommodation well, with one of the grandmothers about.
The Gogos how one names the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Many of them received up to 14 orphans with itself, give them a roof over the head and provide that the children in its uniforms appear every day punctually to the school instruction.
He who has no one more, comes becomes into the protection house Khanyisile, a single woman, that just as of the society paid like both cooks, who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover "Voices for Africa" called a vicinity school into life, constructed two chicken houses and organizes jointly with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have make let a HIV test.
That is is no basic assumption, for so obvious the illness in the entire country also, one is quiet it most dearly dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it with sexuality to do has".
Actually strangely in a country, in which the kings officially 14 wife holds itself.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Mswati III., is well known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things it is owed also this nationally sanctioned life form that the HI virus in the past decades so quickly spread out.
But also the many wall workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms to be sure at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but that will hardly use.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh".
Around the cultural exchange something to promote, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years jointly through the south of Africa and sings songs of full melancholy, battle spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many know at the southern point of the Dark Continent yet out of times of the Apartheid.
Sing a bus fuller whiter, the songs in a black language - so much recognition brings has not only mood and joy, but rather also already many a grim boundary soldier a couple of tears abgetrotzt.
The trip leads always also after Esitjeni where the singers visit its godchilds.
Also if one does hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than well known.
"Goes to Esitjeni, there is say the light" the people there.
And if one returns the 8733 kilometers as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the tramping singers in the sample room at the Bergheimer street, sees illuminate one it also there.
