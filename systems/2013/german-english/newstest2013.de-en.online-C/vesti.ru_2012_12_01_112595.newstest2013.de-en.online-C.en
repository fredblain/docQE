Birth in the universe
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceship with earth inhabitants on board make itself on the search for a replacement planets.
Rescue in order to humanity, the important question stands how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
There are not many choices according to my opinion.
De facto there are only two real planets that we at least hypothetically could inhabit.
"Namely Mars and Venus", says the scientific colleague of the astronomical star mountain institute Wladimir Surdin.
While however the conditions are comparatively life friendly on Mars, a temperature of 500 degrees rules on the surface of the Venus.
Live would be only in large height or in the orbit of the Venus, therefore in that all, possible.
The question of the propagation in the all treated the researchers first of all with regard to the Flora.
Already a half century before that experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas cultivated in the orbit did not differ in the slightest by the earthly types.
It followed the breeding of insects, more exact of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into the universe in order to investigate how the weightlessness affects the development of embryo.
It develops an entirely normal chick.
Yet then the problem begins.
"The problem insists therein, that the chick stop find must; it must on its legs stand can and begin, itself to move", clarifies the laboratory leader of the institute for medically biological problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without firm underground, the chicks flipped over wildly.
Ten hours of late stumpften the instincts of the new-born completely off.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later died it then simply.
"Twice let we chick slip and placed that very then on, because it is simply impossible, there with them to work", holds Wladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in that all firmly.
The last brood cage with animals flew 16 years ago into the orbit.
In the spring 2013, the experiments are continued.
However only same sexual species will be on the organic satellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that became all sent already fertilized in that.
Fundamentally was nothing assessed at the same time special.
"That was straight with the organic satellites, but was renewed it only a single experiment, and the researches must be continued", notes Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got new generation.
The problematic nature of the propagation directly in the space one was able to solve not yet.
The task is difficult.
Animals, that are torn out of its natural habitat, cannot follow simply its propagation drive.
In contrast to animals, the person could that fundamentally.
The Homo sapiens is capable to abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
Out of ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
Yet women have flown already for 50 years in that all.
There was the largest risk in Tereschkowa.
The most valuable that possesses humanity is the organism feminine.
Our gull flew therefrom, and following question would have been able to answer no one on the earth: Does it overcome the world space flight?
Will it be able to bring a child after this flight to the world?
"In the end answered no one this question", says space flight veteran awake seaweed Watschnadse.
The first feminine cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, bore in June 1964, only a year after its world space flight, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in that all, Swetlana Sawizkaja, that was twice in the orbit and performed even works outside of the spacecraft, a son bore.
Nevertheless a risk remains.
We have only extremely few cosmonauts with whom after long flights of all well went and got it healthy new generation.
"The more, is the more dangerous it itself in flights into the orbit", concludes cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian federation.
And yet humanity must after new ways in the biotechnology, that radiation protection and the producing of artificial gravitation seek.
The Hydrolabor in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is an obligatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a suspense condition, the cosmonauts win routine for the work in the open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Also if adults perceive water as comfortable, it is a strange environment; but baby perceive water as a natural element.
It is, would discard as the small Ichtyander testimonies therefrom that life emerged from at the country the ocean.
There is a context between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and can become accustomed that, that it then more easily to water.
In principle that is logical because from the birth for first swimming just once 2 weeks pass.
"That is too little time, around something to forget", says baby floating teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a new-born child the weightlessness is therefore a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the condition of the weightlessness, the belly musculature and basin musculature disappears enormously quickly and therewith also the capacity decreases to press out here the child.
Well well, let's go around that through birth its leading remedies.
The birth could take place for example also in a special chamber in order to press out here the child.
"But what does then" happen?, reads the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand the child needs also artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth attraction, the organism cannot instruct the skeleton and the muscles.
A new-born child cannot be stuck in the orbit like an adult to the training into a load suit.
It that will be missing simply, is what kind of life of elementary importance.
"This experiment, that we jointly undertake, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, in addition will lead, that we a hindered, a perfectly maladjusted person to the world bring become", says the leader of the bio-ethics commission of the institute for medically biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow, ahead.
Previously the birth of children in the universe is bare theory.
Sometime it becomes however reality if the earth inhabitants in its spaceships break open to a distant planet, that becomes the home for its in the all born descendant.
