In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marihuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands be becomes in the southeast Colorados for an offense before court, that in this country already soon legal: The possession of some less marihuana chunk and a pipe with which it smoked this.
According to Orozco it and some friends were at a September day with the car in Lamar near the boundary to Kansas underway when they were stopped.
After the police officer had found marihuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalier offense, that respectively with a punishment of 100 U.S. dollars accommodated are - and received a court appointment.
"We become how criminal treats", so Orozco.
Is it but also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the country of legalizeing small quantities marihuana to the own use, depends the answer in hunderten of smaller drug offense fewer on the law, than of the location.
Hundreds of infringements that revolve around marihuana become here and in the Staate Washington, that similar measures approved, already fallengelassen.
The police authorities does not pursue adult over 21 years more long for possession in small mass. This legally is allowed as soon as the new laws in the next weeks step effective.
But district attorneys in the more conservative districts Colorados announced, existing marihuana offenses followiera and quote still people before court.
To the same time, several cities vote, of the suburbs that verse to the Western Mountains about that to prevent from new, national licensed marihuana businesses the opening in its communities.
"This situation develops so quickly further, that I not at does all know, what next happen becomes", says Daniel J. Oates, police boss in Aurora who lies east of Denver.
And also regulating authorities in the state Washington scratch themselves helplessly at the head.
They wait for a guidance to the arrangement of a license system for the production, manufacture, the sales and marketing and the sale of the drug - and have at the same time a time period to the 1st of December 2013 before eyes.
In Washington, one is the view that Colorado in every trap is most countries ahead, what concerns the regulation of marihuana. There the drug became first medical purposes and then to the own consumption legalizeed.
"Colorado has a more strongly regulated market. The country suits itself therefore well to the orientation", says smith Brian E., speaker of the regulatory agency for Spirituosen in the country Washington.
But smith gives also to that no place or system can do more to serve than in the sense of a coarse clue.
"We have no real precedent, that we follow can", joins it thereto.
That Washington law, I named-502, steps on the 6th of December effective and forms legalizes is therewith also the final point of a gray zone, in which the national license system exists to be sure not yet, but the possession.
And unpleasant practice questions must be clarified in this time - about how the national specification of an "appropriate access" is supposed to be arranged to licensed marihuana with the ban by cannabis businesses in the vicinity by 300 meters around schools, park, playgrounds and child care arrangements.
"Nowhere becomes it be heavier, a location for a licensed cannabis business to find than in metropolitan areas, especially in the conurbation of Seattle", means Ben Livingston, speaker for that "center cannabis legal for", a research group formed recently.
On the 21st of November, Chief Oates sent its colleagues in Aurora an e-mail in which he explained, the district attorney not more long would pursue smaller marihuana offenses with people over 21 years, and that the police would strive for "from immediately" no punishment notices for these offense.
Chief Oates added that the police would put through further municipal specification to the regulation of Anbauern of medical marihuana and drug dealers would be pursued further.
In Weld County in the north Colorados, district district attorney Ken represents baked a more severe view.
After the voting, it indicated would pursue, its authority cases of marihuana possession further, mainly in order to move consumer to the withdrawal.
Up-to-date 119 people for the possession of about 50 grams or less marihuana must answer to court although many were accused also for other offenses.
"Our authority has the duty, offences to pursue, with which it itself to the deed moment around criminal offenses acted", let baked be reported in an explanation.
The reactions are even at places such as the rural Mesa County where voters rejected the marihuana initiative, conflicting.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, does not indicate adult for the possession of smaller quantities more long.
District district attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided however also in addition to not let fall all being outstanding possession procedures.
"I believe not, that I my time therewith would waste, the right to prevail, until it changes", says it.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, was already from the beginning clear that it would not be simple to arrange the personal consumption of marihuana with the complexities of government and right system.
And the contradictory reactions in the entire country promoted a far-reaching discrepancy under local official with regard to the large green experiment too days.
With district district attorneys would concern it one "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer out of Denver, that for marihuana offense before court standing accused represents and acts on the spot as a speaker for the national organization to the reform of marihuana laws.
"You have a so large part of its life therewith spent, people for that criminal to pursue, that it the legalization still do not accept can", believes it.
As the first country, the smaller quantity marihuana such as alcohol treat, are been Colorado and Washington as national pattern cases for the legalization about drugs.
While champion and country official prepare themselves for an age of legal sale, they wait simultaneously also nervously for directions of the Federal Government, which wants to treat the sale and the annex of marihuana on federal level further as a criminal offense.
Champions of the legalization movement hope that the justice ministry will give way.
The Federal Government allowed marihuana medical in spite of several sensation exciting arrests by consumer and salesmen the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries to the large part.
Kevin A. Sabet, earlier drug politics adviser of the Obama government is the view that criminalist will enter to be sure probably no doors in order to seize smaller quantities of the drugs, itself however probably str√§uben become to tolerate the marihuanas businesses legal, nationally regulated under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado wait first not at all on that that the federal authorities act.
Yet the election day ago some local community administrations approved moratoriums for new marihuanas businesses although these could open not until about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban that is dismissed probably next week concluded.
"We would want not into a position run, with which we someone license and then on federal level before a large problem stand", quaked Nicholson, member of the city advice.
Our community agreed against this change in the law.
We do not arrange ourselves after that, for which the community decided, and after that, for which the country decided.
Yet many questions are open.
