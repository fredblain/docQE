Šimon Ornest: On our concerts, we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month the end of the world should take place?
That is one of those catastrophe messages, on which we start people so gladly.
With our volumes The Tap Tap, we make ourselves sooner about that amusingly and say that we are the single volume of the world, that can gather sufficient positive energy in order to delay or to prevent the end of the world.
In December you realize moreover a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you more closely introduce our readers the project?
It we concern plan a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung, that already two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for the 21st of December around 11:10 clock mornings.
At the day before that, i.e. on the 20th of December, simultaneously three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava take place from 21:00 clock.
The end of the concerts should be in about at present, to which on the Pacific island Kiribati, that lies in a time zone around 12 hours before us, the Maya calendar ends.
Of whom does this idea come?
Originally probably of me, we subsequently arranged the idea jointly with our graphics Honza Augusta.
At the same time we would like to gather not only sufficiently positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, but rather we would like to think also together with the public about that, in which condition deliver we this world once our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we developed also a unique collection of shoes, T Shirts, pockets and key followers against the end of the world, with whose purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people can support us also.
The volumes The Tap Tap also that has together with other interpreters moreover so-called. Hymn against the end of the world with the title "end of the world falls out of" received.
Already today the hymn is chosen on YouTube very. Will it sound also on the Benefizkonzerten?
Obviously, and to be sure entirely to the end, prefaced that everything out does not work and the end of the world takes place...
The hymn simultaneously is supposed to be sung by all interpreters on all three concerts.
Moreover the hymns live are transmitted together in a direct control of the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes of Tomá Hanák, that also the principle figure of the Jesus in the videoclip plays, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to the collaboration with both?
We cooperate realize also with further personalities of the Czech culture scene, what holds together therewith, that we many Benefizveranstaltungen and concerts...
We strive to bind these people intensively into our projects.
At the same time appeared that that are interested at a collaboration with us, and have joke on that.
Which purpose do the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world benefit?
For the arrangement of the barrier-free development center Studeo at which we work already six years together with the society Tap in that.
The students the are looked after regularly of lecturers, that help them in different leisure time activities.
Because the students do not control even the means, in order to search for the lecturers, we would like to help them in this manner.
In frame of the completion the an own building should emerge, in which we take in then with this project.
In every concert, several groups and interpreters appear.
After which criteria did you choose this?
We wanted to assemble a program, that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague appear for example China ski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with served Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Suchý.
You learn all further on the webpage www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large organizations" also for the future planned?
In May we appear for the first time at the citizen of Prague spring, and also for this concert, we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would like to appear also gladly in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we then already once in the USA are - this would connect also gladly with entrances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are appeared not exactly small, you already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow until now.
The Tap Tap is however a group that consists of people with handicap.
How do you master these trips logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it appears on the first view.
Five of our members are must be conveyed wheelchair driver, i.e. the wheelchairs in the baggage room. Moreover we must drag along naturally many instrument suitcases and other baggage...
Nevertheless it worked out previously always without problems, and British Airways were prepared always very well for us that I partially already was surprised sometimes.
Even in Moscow where we were recently, gave it no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison how it looks in the single countries with barrier freedom, like one there with hindered person goes around etc.
How did you experience these things previously?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and further cities, in which all better functions than here, we were straight in Russia of witness its that in the East of yet all in its beginning is.
Opposite Prague is not Moscow absolutely behindertengerecht. There it is still unusual if someone is in the wheelchair alone in the city center underway.
It is there not yet once obvious that one admits a wheelchair driver for example in the procession.
Fortunately societies that try emerge also there to refer to the problems of people with handicap.
And in which regard must we developed make up vis-à-vis that further countries?
There are hang yet many things, in which we afterwards...
In addition however yet is to be noticed in that an improvement of the situation also always depends on the exertion of the concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usually that also people with heavy handicaps move independently in the public room, into the museum go, use can etc. toilets.
It is however not exactly usual that there a larger group of hindered people is involved actively in the social events, therein are we with the volume The Tap Tap the west a few ahead!
Respect in the public and barrier freedom is a thing, but first if out of our rows important athletes, artist, actor, politician or lawyers come, really will begin the things to change.
Until now these are only individual cases of especially will strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is presently very popular. If we return however a couple of year: What did you motivate in 1998 in addition to establish a volume?
At that time I began as a caregiver in that where I met many young people, who were interested on that to be concerned with somewhat intensively.
And there I myself musician am and play among other things Saxofon, established I together with a colleague a music CORP.
Well, and gradually that is, like our moderator, to say maintains, run (laughs) something except inspection.
Did well known become err me the volumes however not until the last years, or I?
It agrees, helped has us that the collaboration with well known singers; moreover have we also begun to advertise actively for us.
Not deliberately became that, if one performs something and this is not to be seen outward, the own achievement in certain sense existed us.
Thanks to the EU promote moneys, we can furthermore good lecturers, high-value devices and and the like afford.
Was it your goal of bringing it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning I sensed the potential that one can concern the things differently.
In the Showbusiness copies today often one the other.
That is in its manner logical because all new is observed with caution and is accepted first after longer time.
There is only few things really unique, and I venture to maintain that Tap Tap belongs in addition.
The first impression that the spectator has usually is obvious empathy; that is only natural...
But this empathy is absolutely superfluously because people with handicap are no solitary and left beings, that we would have to regret.
People, who can live a full life and can develop, are as far as they have the means necessary in addition.
I say always that if people with handicap succeeds something, this not only for it itself a progress is, but rather for the entire company.
Was it for this success also helpfully that you are a severe boss, how one hears of many people?
If one would like to make somewhat well, one may go in in many things no compromises and must call for also a certain discipline.
This is in my opinion however totally normal.
Some come to us with romantic presentations, and if they assess then, that they have twice the week sample, preparation phases graduate must and spend much time on concert trips, goes out the enthusiasm in many quickly.
So it functions however everywhere, in every volume, that seriously wants to work and wants to reach something.
Presently The Tap Tap of twenty members has.
How many of them have been from the beginning, i.e. since 1998 there?
Only a more only: .
We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent that.
Who has the will and the desire at the joining in, is here always welcome.
