Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The Weltenbummler of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected the basket sport more long than a 60 years and has the entire world bereist.
Few in Puerto Rico control the country such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes a so large intellectual collection of the story of the basketball.
Before it was tied by a stroke in 2008 to the wheelchair, Rexes was for 6 years part of this sport, would be it as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, authorized and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"My life long have I me in the basketball many hats mounted, even several simultaneously, when I president of the BSN, principal director of the national team and president of the association in the '90's was", remembered Reyes in a visit of Primera Hora with it at home in Bayamón where he lives with Isabel, its loyal wife since more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes does not exaggerate with these statements.
The walls of its house are decorated and attest almost all with photos and memories of its long career it.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are that, that remind one of its time in the Vaqueros of the middle of the '50's as a player until 1982, where he celebrated its 15-year-old anniversary as a with manager or manager of the club.
"Those were my best years, that I wetted at the most, because I part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 it would be be might as a manager, with manager or trainer.
Many fulfilling years were, including the five championship one after another of 1971 until 1975.
And then I took leave with a championship 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN.
From then, "Cuco" Ortiz, that received was a very good administrator", says Reyes.
I know yet that gene Bartow, that worked here as a trainer and was engaged at the university of Alabama (Birmingham), said me: "I have a very strong and 2 ms large player.
Would you like it"?
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that ever had Puerto Rico.
Bartow recommended after that the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse that let become established and was one of our best throwers.
I know yet how it said, that, if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for a further provide would become.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted it, but already out of a distance because it stood 1988 already at uppermost place of the association.
To this time, it preferred it to enjoy its execution and that of Mincy in the national team.
I know yet when we won for the first time in the before Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
After that the world championship 1990, with which we covered the fourth place, came, what actually bronze should have been, if this Canadian arbitrator had not been, who let repeat us the last playing style for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the world championship 1990 the best national team that you ever saw?
It belongs to the best how also that that won in the Olympic Games 2004 against the Dream team.
My favorite is however the team of the panamerikanischen games 1991 in Cuba where we won gold and offered a battle to the team of the USA how at that time, when they won against us in the world championship bronze.
At that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were again there, but rather also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, that brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, that 1990 was not able to be because of a knee injury there.
That a team, that was not perhaps with regard to personalities the best with which we won however a gold medal, and the joy large us prepared, was the before Olympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blocked players because of the incidents on the Panamerikanischen games in Mar del Plata, won we contrary to every prognosis the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers on plain of the international tournaments are impressively.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated on this plain so like Piculín.
And this without considering its course in the different leagues, in which it played.
Who was the best trainer out of Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a row of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys pleases me the work of Leo Arill good.
What do you believe is the best what you reached in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team of 1988 to 1995 that comprised the BSN at the beginning the '90's up to 17 teams in a season.
What remains to be done you yet?
There are things that I would have introduced, like for example the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce play for example only in its zone and encounter not until the national Playoffs on teams out of other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed educations and courses for trainer, table official and arbitrator.
On that I am proud.
What do you make today?
I hear gladly music, would see videos of music of my time in YouTube, would enjoy my grandchilds and occasionally I go to a basketball game.
And naturally I enjoy the company my wife Isabel that was always at my side.
