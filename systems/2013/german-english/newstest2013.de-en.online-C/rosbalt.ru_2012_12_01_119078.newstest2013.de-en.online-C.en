Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt. ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Peter castle vanguard", that is dedicated to city inhabitants, who form the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the selected list, already high-ranking representatives of the Peter castle landed go taking place via art scene, whose the boundaries of the city out and find that often recognition in Europe without being well known in the remainder of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The entire city knows Kirill Miller that in red of clothed bearded, that one finds once museum in the Russian, once in the summer garden, once in scene meeting or on openings.
Wherever the pictures by Kirill Miller also issued become, attract it large crowds of people on.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Peter castle socially philosophical artist whom new myths create.
Kirill Miller is an illuminating personality of the Peter castle vanguard end of the 80 and/or beginning of the 90.
It is also a man of the city and does magic through its presence on the street its citizen a smile into the face and provides with them for good mood.
Recently he snatched himself a trick organ and became the Peter castle trick organ player, there he himself for this difficult roll with regard to its artist existence, its philosophy and be felt image finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you not actually always in red and for example in yellow or turquois in the city underway?
I selected the color red as a fashion designer, who explains himself with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image adviser and company.
In the company, all evokes, what deviates something from the gray standard, aggressions and bad behavior.
I want to come however through my provocation with the people into the conversation.
Each of my past provocation was an invitation to the conversation.
- When do you know that you must become painter?
- In a display in the culture palace Newskij, with which my works were issued.
I concept that I must go this way.
Then the time of the old free went, however painters not officially acknowledged were over at that time, and new and free painters how I incomprehensible.
I friendly with the painters of the new generation, therefore with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from that emerged was me "Puschkinskaja 10", and then first once end.
It pulls me to the theater, to the fashion, to the music, actually to all, except the literature.
- And all that united itself in your Art-Klinik.. - It was important to me to stand in the midpoint of the Peter castle culture where the best creating artists should meet themselves.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there there was a musically artistic club for the bohemian, the house of the Peter castle to the renovation works bohemian.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember me also how cord with its project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Cord and its friends sang simple songs to the Play cheek, carried narrow tricots and to them belonged also the composer announced today Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, became out of its "Leningrad".
Dress mountain moderated many programs the time ago of "Halli Galli".
We gave them dress mountain, and it began its large career, but it learned the bases here.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club" Griboedov" have its origin in the kind of clinic.
There our colleagues and regular guests went.
I am a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was in the press a survey with which it concerned the honor "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "artist of the year", and therewith I had arrived at the highpoint.
It is not easy to work in new times after old rules; I am a person of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In the current time, it is simple, famous to become, but culture and popularity are not the same: One can be famous without performing therewith a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Real pearls are many of my pictures and express clearly the relevance and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have a display with the subject "the Russian museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I was earlier social, but now it hurts and prepares anxiety, to be.
In a clown, that of all smudges and loses its tragedy.
I love have the grotesque, and I grotesque ideas.
Let's rescue for example the world in that we prescribe, that every has to disguise itself completely.
Now every pays attention to the clothing and orients itself towards the Äußeren and not at the interior of the person.
But perhaps one may not give a person the hand, but rather should spit it into the face.
The deceit disappears through the disguising.
- Recently we saw you in the roll of the municipal trick organ player. - A culture city should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
Can - also commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, respectful and flattering.
We see the ruin of the cultures.
Earlier the people formed large groups: The Bohemiens loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there is Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to pleased all.
I am no one hundred-dollar-note that pleases everyone.
Now you must consider, whom you will please.
Now every cult star has approximately 100 followers.
- To the entrances of Stas Michailow several thousands come however!
- To it left women come plays, there the sexually social sphere a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and 10 thousands do not come, consequently there is less management, money, and everything goes to ruin.
I have follower, and the most important is not, to deceive it and is to be destroyed the reached not.
In my youth, I painted such pictures, that hung at a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I began with pictures, that come normally first at the end of the career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It is named: intellectual culture and consumption culture.
Consumption has generally no culture, that is somewhat entire other.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up rejected with artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty, and money in order to be able to paint.
That is the culture that I advocate.
- Kirill, what does Petersburg be missing?
- Goods culture experts.
One says: Servant of the culture.
Yet every of them cannot concern itself with culture.
At the real czars, it was differently, for the czars understood perhaps much of culture, but they understood that correct experts are not necessary.
In Moscow, there are presently good advisers.
In Petersburg, we have is blocked which that could be experts, but them the way because it more high-ranking experts needs, who correctly value the first and clear them the way.
Now only the own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, however with the difference that they honestly say, that they don't have to suppose all contemporary art and some painters must seek themselves therefore other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the culture capital; in Moscow, there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art only heavily can grow up.
We require a cultural breeding ground, for for example that have is we meanwhile more author than a reader, and yet not correct.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit displays or concerts.
Here much are that fewer.
Art must be again modern, so like to start of the previous century.
The project is financed out of subsidies of the city Saint Petersburg
