Cause for a dying because of Aids is today a too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when one it the test result confirmed: HIV positively.
"It was, as if a bomb hit", says it over the moment, in which it received the diagnosis "to reduce that the physician without recognizable success tried".
It hid it before its family.
He concluded to attend alone to its illness and began therewith to inform itself about that; and this with such use that he celebrated just its 43rd birthday.
He is came doubtless one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in that he after several fights 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the humane Immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years, what at the beginning the '90's was heavily conceivable, when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more stigmas.
At that time it itself avoided the director of a clinic of the IMSS to take leave, "because it into a dead end led".
At that time AIDS was synonymous for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
To be sure many people come yet always into the clinic, that know nothing of its illness and with which the virus already damage caused, and its immune system exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections are.
31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, i.e. after appearance of the first reported cases, "means the large success today, that the survival of a patient, that the treatment on time receives, and the survival of the general population exact same are", explained the leader of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, whereby he said, that this information had been supported in April this year of an esteemed scientific publication.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented on that the scientists have concluded since the year 2008, that AIDS would be to be sure no death sentence, that however the years of the survival would depend and the quality of life on the degree of the impairment of the immune system the people in start of the treatment, and that that larger chance would have, that are not drug-addicted: up to 30 years in a counting of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a counting Of 500 CD4.
Simply said, mean the above-mentioned executions that, who HIV positively receives at the age of 25 years the diagnosis, in this sense "problem-free 75 years old will can, as long as it under control stands", explained this expert.
In order correctly to be able to incorporate this progress, must be remembered on that that the life expectancy the mexican amounts to today on the average 76 years.
Even if the mortality in the past years significantly diminished has (in Mexico has itself the number of the people, that at AIDS die, of 6,678 cases per year 2007 on 4,862 in 2011 (year report of the ONUSIDA) diminished itself), is it nevertheless correct that since the appearance of the AIDS 60 of percent the patient grasped in the national database died.
Alone in Jalisco died are in 2011,255 people, and to the month of May of this year it already 187 deaths; to be sure is assured that there has been since 2005 universal access to the antiretroviralen medicines.
- Why do people die therefore yet always on that?
- Do not mean is according to opinion the problem the access to the treatment.
This is is my opinion, and so in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no provision problems in the medicines. The problem is that the people come in far advanced condition, because they do not know its infection condition, i.e. in very late phases of the illness.
It makes a striking statement: "Nine of ten patients come to us if they have already an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, are offered will must more premature diagnoses required, why, massively recognition tests" to all people with whom this is required.
The specialists and official of the Consejo Estatal agree this suggestion de Prevención del Sida e Jalisco (Coesida) (more nationally from shot to the AIDS avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio, that let carry out its test in a private laboratory, and this out of the single reason because it a friend of it had made, was that in spite of its young age already in the AIDS phase and had even the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancer-like tumor) What is one of the usual complication.
Everything is differently if you know, that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and would want do nothing hear.
"If I already die must, then rather three times burst", says one in my case.
The change was to that there improvement, I eat good, drive sport and would take the medicines.
Today his parents know only that it had cancer.
I live a normal life, like every other also.
"I work, would undertake much, would have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person", itemizes Fabrizio, that agreed to divide its intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to animate with its testimony that, that have today anxiety in the frame of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know, whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, should learn it how one can live like all people responsibly.
Its message is a summary of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condom behind the counter
Between the health programs and the simple citizen consist large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara, that took on the thing of the HIV.
And the most important is the prevention.
At the places certain in addition "became the distribution by condom actually increases; earlier became it individually delivered, now give it us packages with hundred pieces, what is already good, it gives however yet always people, that no access to a condom have", said he.
To the risk people for new infections, the youths count.
"Why do you need that"? is a common mockery question of social workers, orientation personnel in schools, employee in pharmacies and in the health system that youths not would like to stop itself, the correspondent assured.
It proposed to orient this inefficient distribution newly; the condoms should be not only behind the counter, but rather in edition devices in public toilets of arrangements, that are visited frequently by youth.
The promiscuity is not supposed to be promoted.
It is not supposed to be paid them the beer and motel how the governor Emilio González answered on the question, whether under its administration condoms would become distributed.
"Sexuality sees so not from; best is it, that condom that more closely to bring, the already one sexual activity exercise", brought it it on the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIVS).
The country lies nationally seen at 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and at 13th place with regard to HIV.
92% of the contagion cases take place via sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is appreciated that 50,000 people live with HIV, because it gives for every registered case 4 or 5 people, who do not know it.
