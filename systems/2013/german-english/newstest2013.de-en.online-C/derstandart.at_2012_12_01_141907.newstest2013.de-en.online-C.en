The MVRDV architects prove, are that the true adventures not only in the head - by the example of Spijkenisse and the most young erected book mountain - 2 photos
"I find the building amusingly, it sees futuristically from, and finally gives it again something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby at the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a suggested large business, means: It is "but, beautiful already, the house".
But I ask me for what we need today another library.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and E Books.
Is no person going today yet voluntarily into one of these Old-Style-libraries, or?
Spijkenisse, a hardly examination needy sleep city before the gates of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.
The 80.000-Einwohner-Gemeinde shows the lowest development rate of the entire Netherlands.
In order to work against this stupid circumstance, to contribute concluded one some years ago, to the general standard of education and the seven fictional bridges, that are represented on the Euro certificate, when pretty bepinselte reinforced concrete miniatures to reconstruct.
The success of the development offensive was limited.
And so recognized the city fathers that there would be only a single possibility to become the statistics gentleman: A library must here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdamer architecture office MVRDV, master of the rash beam charts and maker of witty, often cynical constructed, took the thing with accustomed composure and appear to the competition Hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grinning in the face.
And during the jury yet baffled around itself looked and twitched with the shoulders, piled up bolstered the impudent Maas its selected presents of the size after to a pyramid and concluded its aktionistisch speech with the words: "Love township"!
That is it therefore, my suggestion for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years expensive mountain later is poured up the 30 million Euro.
It is part of a revitalization project to which also underground garage, supermarket, postal service and a couple belong dwellings adjacent and rowhouse with altogether 50 dwellings.
Beginning of November was priced the book mountains Library "best with the second price of NL 2012".
Moreover the project is nominated for the Dutch nationally Wood Award 2012.
Therewith the faceless town retort is had pass to offer that to date no longer as a postmodern pedestrian zone and a disconcertedly ugly city hall, behind whose white facades one would be tended, to assume a dairy factory, around a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all however Spijkenisse controls now the first public culture building in the story of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under cheese bell.
There are open itself to be sure an elevator, that leads middle through that mountain massive, but the true room joys and harvest joys in the foot Erklimmen of in heat the topography.
That all around inner room glazed is bright and clear, the burned latch ground and the elegant street lanterns speak unmistakable the language of a public city place.
The urban ambience is perfect.
One keeps an already lookout for park bench, dog and soccer playing boy and girl.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally stand the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, that usually uncomfortable and impersonal is", says Winy Maas.
We placed the classic room configuration on the head and the harvest area from within outward gestülpt.
That in the book mountain is used adept: In the middle, offices, Internets libraries, lie chess club, environment center and house technology headquarters.
The black bookshelves, that are once wall disguise, once parapet, once increasing railing, are a special joy.
Optics, Haptik and smell are strange.
Even inveterate architects and building engineers shake whether the unknown building material the head.
"We wanted here with recycling materials work", explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the township Spijkenisse, on inquiry of the standard.
And so we bumped in a friesländischen agricultural business one day into a suitable waste product out of the agriculture.
For many years one has used a millimeter thin Kunststoffvlies in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields as a root document.
That is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile keeps is, two seasons, after that it ripe for the barrier rubbish.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick disks.
Under heat effect and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, robust material, that smells a bissl after new car and a bissl after sport shoe, discolors itself.
After 105 steps, one arrived at the summit.
One is rewarded traveling long at the end the almost 500 meter in the literature café not only with a fantastic prospect for the city, but rather also with Dutch Kroketten and on potted Ficusbäumen.
They provide for atmosphere, above all however for the correct humidity in the literature mountains.
Contributions for the new soul
"One would become it do not believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass areas a show project as regards ecology", says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled becomes with earth warmth.
Although the book mountains under a glass slump stands, the sun itself seems at sunny days only shortly in that in.
The wide Holzleimbinder, that stand diagonally to the glass facade, serve as a tailing and catch a large part of the sun irradiation off.
The room climate is very comfortable.
Fully automatic blinds settle the remainder.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic out of the IT SECTOR, ventured already the way into the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde that the Boekenberg quite as a Spijkenisses "a long time overdue soul" designates.
The reason: To the opening a few weeks ago every inhabitant was invited to contribute a book out of its personal existence.
Therewith the optical spaces in the not yet completely equipped library - presently 70,000 pieces - are supposed to be filled first of all once.
The draft rose.
The shelves are filled until casually.
"Is nothing worse than a half empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, has every inhabitant thanks to our invitation now a certain relation to this new house.
Everyone knows that its book part of this building is.
And if it is only for decoration.
Therewith MVRDV is arrive that king discipline, that one names in the specialty jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse wrote literature story.
So young and uneducated it also be likes.
That is finally a starting point for identity.
