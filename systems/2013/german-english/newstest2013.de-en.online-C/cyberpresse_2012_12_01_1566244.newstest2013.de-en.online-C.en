The Higgs Boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs Bosons excited a certain sensation in the last summer, and this for good reason.
One believes in the deed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than at the mechanism, that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And in the end it concerns observed became the last particle, whose existence of the standard model - our best or "at the least incorrect" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but empirically not yet.
But for the physicists, it is not certain yet complete that it concerns really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it strongly resembles the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition this seems confirmed through new data to become, that were introduced in this week on a large physics congress in Kyoto, but yet data are missing in order to be certain about that perfect.
Let's assume nevertheless that it concerns actually the Higgs, because apparently only a slight risk exists to be mistaken, and let's regard us, around which it goes.
There is in this world an inevitably indispensable law that causes, that two objects cannot be simultaneous at the same place available.
It is not possible to violated this rule - and do not try it too strongly because you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, turns out that for it also such a law counts: the Pauli' sche from end principle that purports, that two particles cannot occupy the same room to the same time, if they are in the same "quantum condition", whereby this "condition" consists in the large and entire of some of its characteristics.
Therefrom outgoing the physicists divide the particles in two categories.
In a corner, the good citizens, who are designated as a Fermione and obey good the Pauli principle, are.
And in the other, the Bosonen, a vile volume of anarchist move is holy, which nothing - in any case not this principle what means, that they can be in the deed to the same time at the same place.
These Bosonen subdivide itself in accordance with the web page The Particle Advent original of the Berkeley laboratories (that by the way absolutely astonishingly is) in two groups: the Mesonen that we will not treat here and the "power particles", through which the large powers of nature spread and with which the Higgs Boson would be used somehow.
It must be emphasized here however that these Bosonen are not all so exotic creatures, how one could mean.
If you are in a position to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a Bosons of extraordinary banality: the Photon or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic power.
If namely a particle with an electric load accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field becomes "disturbed" exactly at this place, in about like a pebble stone, that was thrown into a pond.
Through this "interference", an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared radiation or ultraviolet radiation etc.) emerges, and this wave is nothing but a Photon and therefore one of the Bosonen "carriers of the power".
More stable field
Same applies to the Higgs Boson, with which difference that another field, that must "disturbed" become Higgs field, appears, so that this Boson.
To be sure the Higgs field is very much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a few comparably with a frozen pond, whose surface could become only of a very large rock furrowed.
Therefore a gigantic particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! To reach - around such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in order to explain the relation between the Higgs and the mass.
All particles are not in the deed and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like Magnete, this do, but other not - for example a piece of paper never would become of even at the refrigerator hold.
And likewise all particles with the Higgs field do not interact possess: that that do it, a mass while the other (like by the way the Photon) possess no mass.
For what do all these researches can now "be good", asks woman Plamondon?
For the science, they serve the examination of the standard model (SM), and they enable the physicists also to examine all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM exactly.
There are by the way numerous physicists who hope longingest, that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and some holes of the model could plug.
One must say that latter yet large deficiencies shows, because it no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter offers, that ca. 80% of matter of the universe forms (again ups!).
To be sure such deviations were not found in the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these researches for the general population are to be predicted more hard, but it could be supposed incorrectly that there would be none.
By the way: in the early '60's the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not assume that its works such a revolution would release.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else further.
In the deed developed already said the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - that in the Bell live worked has, in which the laser in the '1960's invented became, and that 1962 itself the first duration stroke laser (the first were gepulst) - to us that the laser was looked at at the beginning sooner than a "laboratory to be played".
Stand before...
Moreover applications can result also from all the instruments, that surround the research.
For example Willard Boyle 1969 developed again a small light sensor during its works in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor serves today all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and brought in it 2009 the Nobel Prize for physics.
Naturally this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change inevitably our life, but means it, that one it really never know can...
