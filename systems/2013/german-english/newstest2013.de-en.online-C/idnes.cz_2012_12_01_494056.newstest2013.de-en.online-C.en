The lifting of the law over public-spirited works is no solution.
In the past week, the constitutional court canceled the law over public-spirited works.
This decision evoked a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to observe the problematic nature once of a wider perspective from.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of the unregulierten of economic competition.
In the end effect, this means that the single economic systems in a permanent conflict stand together.
Cause for that is the principle of the free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of the private capital that goes with unrestrained finance speculations hand in hand.
Based on the large differences of the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions.
Under this concept, a condition is to be understood, more favorably were with which the manufacturer tries, through importations in the economic competition to exist in that he "underbid" the competition in order to tear through it a larger market share at itself and to increase its profit.
In the large standard, this means for most businesses to transfer its fabrication abroad or to shop there favorably, or to abandon however its business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparably high cost of labor.
Because the private capital bears no social responsibility and therewith also no responsibility for unemployment caused by it, the country editions climb of necessity.
This situation yet is reinforced in that the Mr. entrepreneurs are absolutely indignant to pay its taxes and to replace through it the damages caused for society as a whole economic and social by them.
This situation is generally well known so that concrete statistics are superfluous here.
The ruthless practice of the private capital creates in the single economic systems a situation, in which the governments see forced themselves, to step in competition together, in order to sink the social level of the own population artificially and to attract therewith foreign capital into the country.
In other words: The governments deliver the own population without consideration on the social consequences to the private capital.
This expresses itself especially in changes of valid laws.
It that own population to force in addition is goal of these measures of accepting the dictation of the private capital especially in the wage area.
This happens to the one through economical compulsion in long-term unemployment, to the other through the circumcision of the employee rights.
The result are growing poverty, as well as always larger differences between arm and empire.
In Germany, there have been already for some years public groceries duty places for arms, that are no longer in a position, to eat through own work.
The amount of the concerned goes already into the millions.
In the course of the increase of the competitive stature the German economy it comes regularly to cases, in which employees receive a so slight wage, that the country must increase its income to the existence minimum.
Such a scandal became also in the case of assistants busied in the German Bundestag uncovered.
The savings measures practically all EU south countries will run out undoubtedly on the same condition, with which the people are forced under the pressure of a catastrophic fall of its social level, to hope to emigrate (like it in the 19th century the case was), or for a hunger wage at the edge of the company to darben and there on that that sometime private investment capital will flow into the country.
Does here impose comes itself nature appropriate for the question, from where this capital?
If it comes out of one of other EU country, poverty of a country in the other hikes solely; or the capital remains work equally very from, for in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco or Egypt and/or in Africa generally the employed for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns entirely Latin America.
Liberal theories and media maintain to the disgust that the country may not itself with capital at its own economic system of involved, and that planned economy leads to the economy catastrophe.
The private capital persists narrowly on its standpoint that the country may not interfere directing into the economy.
Then one must ask himself however whether the private capital does not influence or quite directs the politics and therewith the entire country in the own selfish sense.
Here the unambiguous answer is: Yes.
The proof for that is the existence of a practically almighty and in all countries omnipresent lobbies.
The result is is a despairing situation in the area of the corruption, the mutual before division, a legislation, in that practically all punishable, but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is so that a state ministry delegates lacking finances private, thickly with the industry entangled right business with the elaboration of drafts of a bill.
These drafts of a bill are dismissed subsequently in the Bundestag.
All force comes then no longer from the people how it announce the western constitutions, but rather of strong finance groups, that prefer its own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies run describes presently quickly into a situation, like it Appian in its work to the crisis of the Roman republic at times Cäsars and Pompeius' : "The country was grasped were occupied already for some time in the ruin, and the offices with force.
Against bribe, through illegal Erschleichung of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption proliferated unrestrained, and the people went with already bought voices to the choice"... "People with character did not apply had" himself for offices, so that the country as a result of this decline for eight months no consul... "One began to speak already really about that that the single medicine in this heavy situation would be an alone domination, and that a strong man selected become would must"... Appian thought at the same time to be sure of Pompeius, but the strong man was then in the end Cäsar that the democracy replaced durably by the alone domination.
How appears, the current company is based just as as in the antique on the ruthless preference of the own advantage without paying attention to for society as a whole interests.
The private capital is not already of its nature here in a position, that advantage to recognize and to put through for the entire company.
The result, today like at that time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elite, that themselves not in the slightest around depth issuing reforms strive.
We must the cause for the recovery of the fascism and communism therefore in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems in that 19th and 20th century seek.
Of the current condition out of seen, can be looked at the downfall of these regimes for the benefit of liberal democracies as a certain recess, with which the next round already is outlined.
Especially catastrophic the fact is that the current elite the losses possible in the future by hundreds of thousands of human life, that humanitarian and social catastrophes, whose witness we are already today as well as the crimes against the humaneness, how we know it out of the older and newer story, in perfect ignorance vis-à-vis stand.
The lifting of the law over public-spirited works is here no solution, at least no durable.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced, also to seek further ways, in order to press the social level of the population downward.
This trend is therefore system contingent.
The single solutions are aimed politically social reforms, that increase the capital participation of the country at the economy, that influence of the citizens raise to the government and the monopoly position of the private capital in the company weaken for the benefit of the country.
