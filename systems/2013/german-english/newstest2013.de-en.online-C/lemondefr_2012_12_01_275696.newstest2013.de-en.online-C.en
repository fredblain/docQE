With Bitcoin, paying and selling is possible without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the base of central banks, identified transaction and handling charges between the participant.
In addition a political vision is tangible like so often in these technologies: the conviction that the current, of bank monopoly monetary system formed leads, to finance crises.
In the deed, that of Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is certain invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (however in dollar, Euro etc. convertible) and a protocol for the exchange such as BitTorrent, that enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, already about 200,000 transactions were grasped.
Some thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as a contribution or as a currency.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 had peakd an of 30 dollars (23 Euro), he fell five months later on 2 dollars before he has himself today on approximately ten dollar recovered (the courses are on the web page bitcoincharts. com itemized).
Nothing especially impressive in comparison with the international trade of real currencies or finance products.
Nevertheless the European central bank (EZB) in a report published in October showed interest on virtual currencies for this.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the largest success", "in the competition with the dollar or Euro" and "similarly to to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs win or buy can of other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits", that are used in order to make headway in a video-game, that one through games (and sometimes also trade back).
The social network Facebook developed also such a system.
To be sure the trade is controlled each time of a central authority and is processed.
With Bitcoin, all network knots Verwahrer are simultaneous the calculation book, inspector, money Emittenten as well as buyer and salesman.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two e-mail addresses in form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can select another address for each payment, what guarantees the anonymity.
A row of the data standing with this transaction in context is signed electronically by a double encoding system.
In this manner the network can test the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is to be guaranteed also possible that the acted Bitcoins in the calculation book common in the entire network of the public accounts are available.
The decisive step exists therein to register this new transaction into this book.
This happens over a mathematical task, that is started on the computers whereby the winners, who is a type preliminary headquarters banker who possesses privilege, to add this additional line.
It concerns a cutting up of the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and join it a number thereto before the entire becomes "chops".
It is the goal of finding that number, that yields a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number was found, the other knots effortlessly can test whether it is the correct.
The transaction is connected therefore durably with the chain of all other transaction, and each modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay two times for deceiving very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one would be validated both transactions by the network and remains the other without connection because both different fingerprints possess.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To the prevention of an inflation, this reward regularly is halved, probably before end 2012.
The Bitcoins present in the circulation are limited therefore to 21 million, but lets up to a hundred millionth divisible, what one certain latitude...
In addition the difficulty of the task with every improvement of the computing power is increased.
Life of the network had already heights and depths.
The web pages that allocate services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin enclosures stolen.
"The used weakness concerns not the actual protocol", assures Pierre Noizat, that just Paymium introduced, that is a business for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The EZB reports also over the possibilities of the money wash with the help of this anonymous service.
To be sure cash shows also these deficiencies.
Important participants such as Wikipedia deny contributions of this type.
Of other like the blog platform Word press, they are accepted.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann institute in Israel analyzed and shown the calculation book that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in the circulation.
In November a "Mega sale" was started.
"Thirty thousand dollar were exchanged", is happy Jon Holmquist that works for the business Coinabul, that converts Bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, that also author of a book is over this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses however Bitcoin to the validation of the transaction that are through it cheaper.
In addition the proprietor administers its identity and can remain therefore anonymous.
The system easily can implement become at the dealers, and no new terminals or computer programs latter must install.
They must indicate simply only an address, "photographs and recognized" will can that of a telephone, gives Pierre Noizat on, that assures, that it user cable would send has.
A general trend is to be indicated it, with which hierarchical systems are roofed for the benefit of more strongly horizontally directed systems.
"It becomes some time last, until itself Bitcoin puts through, but 2013 could a turning point be", predicts it.
The EZB plans in its report by the way, the different to value today as a highly esteemed risks in the case a success of this currency newly.
