Poland and the space.
Past week was received Poland on a cabinet council session of the member nations of the European space organization ESA as a twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is therewith the second member nation out of the former Eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, that at the 12th of November 2008 ESA member became).
Poland began a narrow collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and tade part in the following years at several ESA projects.
The way of Poland in the space began to be sure much earlier.
Already before the second world war, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space flight busied itself whereby they bumped therewith not always into understanding.
I remind one here for example of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of the 6th of December 1933 in the Resident of Warsaw observatory with which the author introduced thought out of its pioneer work "entrance to the Kosmonautik".
The ideas of the young engineer (give. 1905) the listeners let themselves remembered however coldly, and after years Šternfeld yet that solely Dr. had shown Jan Gadomski interest in its work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP deer established by Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis deer in 1934 for "entrance to the Kosmonautik".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became later an important advocate of the astronomy and the space flight.
In Polish periodicals published it hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Contribution acknowledged Gadomskis worldwide to the development of the space flight was lauded among other things in that one of the crater was named on the earth turned away side of the moon after it.
Already in 1925, a railroad Draisine was constructed in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
The author of the design and the details this intention remained unfortunately unknown.
It is not clarified yet once whether the rocket should be used for starting or for braking the Draisine.
The information to this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to concern itself with rocket operated stories.
The institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi led the research projects.
Out of the traditional documents is evident that the research had advanced into the stage practical tests.
The research was interrupted then to be sure through the invasion of the German armed forces.
In 1937 immersed in the specialty press of that of Ing. Coming designs of a photo electric hunt rocket up, and in the year following on that appear the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
Both projects concerned themselves with the military utilization of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects were coordinated to the military utilization of the rocket technology of the temporary scientific consultation sow shot (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).
The from shot was arranged 1937, was concluded its work after two-year activity however by the beginning of the war.
Further articles to the space flight appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space flight company (pole skis Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company results 1954 in the November edition of the periodical Problemy in which four extensive articles of the space flight are dedicated.
The article of prof. M. Subotowicz contains the suggestion to the foundation of a space flight company.
At present there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the investigation of the space future would have.
Already in its beginning in 1956, the Polish space flight company PTA strove joins around one to the 1951 established international federation for space flight, and actual 1956 orderly member became the PTA already in the autumn.
In the following year, the first PTA chairperson, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), deputy chairperson of the international federation became for space flight.
It possessed this office to its death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA has been involved authoritatively in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for the scientific research.
The first type that completed became RM-1, in 1957 that first start resulted on the 10th of October 1958.
The rocket with a maximal altitude of 1800 ms was about 80 cm long and weighed not entirely 5 kg.
Later an improved version that RM-1A constructed,, and 1959 became began in the flight tests with the two step rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 ms long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development step should be already in a position to perform real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and should come for the observation of Höhenwinden to the use.
In 1962 however the further development was adjusted.
Successor of the first rockets of the type RM became developed that in the years 1962 to 1965 Meteor-1-Rakete.
The rocket was conceived as a two step rocket, its overall length amounted to was 510 cm and the start weight 32.5 kg.
Of this rocket, three types were developed distinguished (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), that from one another in the size of the carrier room for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete controlled frame fortune, Meteor-1B a carrier room with 0.4 liter over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximal altitude amounted to 37 km in all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2-Rakete was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 a start weight of 380 kg had and was in a position to convey a payload of 10 kg into a height of approximately 60 km.
After that the versions were constructed Meteor-2H and meteor-3.
Worth mentioning also that is joins Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 on which two years followed later the foundation of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland was involved in the frame of the Interkosmos program also in the space research with Soviet satellite, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became after the Czech Vladimír Remek of second Interkosmonaut.
