Old combats, new Near East
The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could prove to be an unexpected main pillar for the peace
Can there be ever continuous peace between Arabians and Jews in the Near East?
The newest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the middle of the usual guilt assignments, countless buildings in debris and ash were put, more than 140 Palestinians, that therefrom civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time are hit rockets out of Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolises tels Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Yet although Israelis and Palestinian in its historic conflict seem caught, changes the near East around it around.
The Arabic spring did not create a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or - Palestinian and Israelis became part of these confused.
Perhaps this will lead only to more bloodshed.
Yet there are reasons to the acceptance that the deadly stalemate situation could find finally its end.
A war, that neither lost yet won becomes
On the first view, optimism seems in view of the current situation all other as mounted.
Even if the armistice arranged at the 21st of November stops, the dieswöchigen battles the Hartgesottenen strengthened on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas, who Islamist movement, that has controlled since 2007 the Gaza Strip, will maintain of itself to have driven back the Israelis although its grouping had to indicate even large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gazastreifens in one of the most wretched and thickly most populated corners of the planet are corralled, it is not arrive Israel until now to destroy the Hamas.
Actually the Hamas in the West Bank gains controlled becomes, that by the competing, moderated Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the end that they have the time on its side.
So, how Islamists in the Arabic world won at influence, the Hamas was able to pull powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, an again gaining strength, regional power, that counted as Israel of narrowest Muslim ally once, seized for the Hamas party - exactly like Qatar, one of that pass and most dynamic gulf countries.
Rejoicing Hamas followers believe that around Israel an Islamist crescent moon forms - of the Lebanon in the north where the militant Hisbollah has the power, over Syria where rebels of an increasingly More islamist stamp could stand before the Stürzung Bashar Assads, up to Jordan where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And especially the ascent of the Moslem fraternity under Präsident Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the country inhabitant strongest and most important Arabic with distance - at the southern flank of Israel persistently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot, who reigned Egypt to its slump 2011 for 30 years, had only little time for the Hamas over.
In contrast to that the fraternity with the Hamas is intermarries and its leaders stronger of people views dependent.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could prove to be a participant, who cannot be squeezed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners on the other hand let pull an opposed conclusion.
Militarily seen is the Hamas no more danger.
The Israeli rocket defense system, "Iron cathedrals", was able to prove itself and were destroyed many of the Hamas rockets.
At least a while long more quietly will be able to sleep Israel.
In diplomatic regard, the United States hold imperturbably at its position firmly. Many European countries responsibly made the Hamas for the newest force escalations.
Israel issued, especially under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, it in last years well that ignored the peace process to large parts.
Although rockets killed out of the Gaza strip since 2004 about 30 Israelis, the country remained relatively free of suicide attempts - not finally thanks to the barrier plants, that into the West Bank and therewith in the main parts of a contingent Palestinian country in stray. These protect expanded become the Jewish settlements, that were declared to be sure to be people illegal, however always further.
Netanyahu stands there well. Its Likud party allied itself in the forefield of the choices on the 22nd of January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even more aggressive group.
Why do also these cunning Palestinians pamper and leave an own country to them?
Did if they have actually the control of the West Bank, they would become then not exactly like its comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip also rockets discharge?
No, it is better to hold and to punish it behind the wall in chess, should venture it it to lift the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail. Yet the Arabic spring could make them a stroke through the calculation.
Even if the Islamists, who sit in Egypt and in other countries now at the power, remaining have, few for Israel, they will concentrate first of all on the difficulties in the own country.
The defense budget of Israel is larger than that of its four Arabic neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arabic governments hardly in the restoration of its economy.
To reach that the pragmatic president Mursi got together itself with Barack Obama, around an armistice, a promising sign could be - and perhaps the start of a new era symbolize.
Also Israelis should think more long-termed.
While the remaining Arabic world undertakes timid steps toward democratization, Palestinians are robbed further its self-determination right - a powder keg, that will explode undoubtedly one day in the Israeli occupied zones, exactly like this week a bus in tel Aviv exploded.
The suppression undermines already now the democracy in the Jewish country, and with the growth of the Arabic population, this situation only will worsen.
Bloody missions to the repression of the Hamas in the Gaza strip will demand over the years increasingly its diplomatic tribute.
Both sides require an impetus from outside
The correct answer is that, that of the sensibler representatives of both sides, whom large part of the remaining world will represent and of this newspaper: Two countries with which Israel to security purposes lectures zones.
That - for the near future small - hope exists therein that the armistice of outsides more influence to the execution of this solution grants.
Egypt must stop jointly with Turkey and Qatar now the weapon deliveries into the Gaza strip and better positioned than ever before, expanded through zone exchange and a joint Jerusalem, to convince by the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish country on base of the boundaries of 1967.
Outside Arabic nations should move also the Hamas and Fatah to a unification.
Therewith would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian country than with the impending proposal on UN observer status.
Also Obama must contribute its part in addition to move Israel to negotiations.
During its first tenure, it neglected the presentation of its own peace plan.
Far removes seems in the white house it, as would be it just as a participation disinclined.
Yet that is a deplorable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have an essential interest in a stable Near East.
And in addition a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians belongs.
