AIDS Day: Stampfen, help
At Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi - and in Swaziland satisfaction, children orphaned by AIDS.
The story of a link that far more than 8733 kilometres.
First, there is the stampfen: Cowboy stiefel, basketball shoes, Damenpumps and gentlemen slipper in bed for the tact, find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voice of the singer slowly emerging-old, bass, tone and Sopran-press, betören and follow.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, it almost from its substance shoes, if it brings together with its elastic wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, the music area of the Institute for Medizinische psychology at Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi a new song.
Of the 50 Sängerinnen and singer came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin to the householder.
"om Obani" is not an easy step, every chorus agree with another text and do this in a very foreign language: Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV in the world, the UNAIDS estimates that the United Nations program to fight against AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
Living in Swaziland 245000 children orphaned by AIDS.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For the club has 180 children orphaned by AIDS in the village of Esitjeni Voices for Africa godfather found in Germany.
70 of them are secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can play a sponsor.
It guarantees the child, Schuluniform tuition and a warm meal every day in the Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu stories erzähler or Lobpreiser.
Fluent in the Bantusprache can sing, but no one in this area.
For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this foreign soft language and also brings them and to get back where they originally came from, in the southern Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the German Chores Stimmgewalt.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large number of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents, because they are HIV resistance.
In Esitjeni is reflected in the small, what in Swaziland is: High HIV infection rate lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Restrictions on freedom of male Vorhaut, the proven to reduce by half the risk of contagion, by the people won't be adopted.
More than 40 per cent of people in Swaziland bear the immunodeficiency virus, with center 30 to die is not uncommon.
In a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the chorus discovered the village, but above all saw the Imbongis many children in the streets, which are not only lacked parental care, but simply of everything: Food, clothing, education.
Without school in a poor country was certainly no chance.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later founded the chorus "Voices for Africa" the club, which has since then almost professional care about the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.

However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection.
Because partly agent sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by Schmierinfektionen and close physical contact.
Therefore recommend experts in particular often changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups.
Diagnosed early and repercussions cured most STI can be avoided.
By godmothers, donations and, last but not least, the Gagen, the chorus throughout Germany ersingt, some come together.
"overall, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself managed Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and durchsetzungsstarke woman who money from Germany.
They are also considering that the orphans well accommodated in one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as we call the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have included up to 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms schooling appear on time every day.
Anyone who has no one else comes into obstruction of protection Khanyisile, a single woman who will be paid by the club in the same way as the two cooks, every day for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa" has also launched a Nähschule, two chicken houses built and in conjunction with the American Health Organisation PSI organised a HIV test that many in the village have let.
This is not a foregone conclusion, because the disease throughout the country is so obvious that they are ideally dead silence.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state sanctioned life that the HIV has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms exist in every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another-flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange something, the Imbongi-chorus every two or three years jointly by the South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern light on the black continent even in times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition does not only mood and joy, but has also been some fierce border guards a few tears abgetrotzt.
The trip continues even after Esitjeni, where the singer visit their godchildren.
Even though the small village on maps little, in the valley of the river Ezulweni it is more than aware.
"after Esitjeni, there is the light" say the people there.
And if the 8733 kilometres returns to Heidelberg, stampfenden Sängern in the test area in the Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shine as well.
