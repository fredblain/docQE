Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Mercury
The special messenger has found evidence that there is on the planet Mercury ice.
The ice sheet is possibly up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are some frozen water, as three on Thursday in the journal Science "published studies have shown.
The special messenger have found evidence that it constantly in the region of the planet a shadow in the ice sheet.
This is at least 30 centimeters and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
The water was probably may also of comet or asteroid, which are taken on the Mercury.
No one brings the discovery of ice but linked to the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the messenger-special, said Sean Solomon.
The temperature in the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the discovery could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, to explore the depths of space.

As Pluto behind Neptun about the sun, Ceres is under the new definition of the International astronomical Union of 2006 no "Planet."

The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (dreigeteilt, dreigespalten), as dark dust lining the fervent heart of stars-birthplace dreiteilen.

Our insights into space: The main telescopes
The telescope should be 1608 by Hans Lipperhey invented-even before Galileo Galilei it a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes have been increasing and the insights that they provide deeper.
30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego the world's largest Fernrohr.
The mirror, in this picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope.
We can look into space on equal to, each with two mirror 8.4 metres in diameter.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias Kanareninsel on La Palma is huge-alone is the mirror to 10.4 metres in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres.
Detriment of good design: The telescope is in his heights of ground to a halt - and thus in his limited mobility.
Also the hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is caught up in the heights of view.
Their special: The high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is, despite comparatively low mirror installation - to the world's largest mirror dispatch.
With the help of a radio teleskops in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers the All after Außerirdischen signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) each computer owners can help by computing power available.
Look at the observatory waiting for the European star (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope, which is worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors the Fernrohr can also median Infrarotspektrum ausleuchten.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory is the European extremely Large Telescope.
Its main levels will include fat 42 metres - and almost a thousand mirror elements together.
With images, but until 2018.
By 2007, the two were girl-telescopes on the root volcano Mauna KEA as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirror with an average of 10 metres.
The girl-telescopes are part of the Mauna KEA Observatory, which provides them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF looks to the sky.
Also on Mauna KEA to create a new, huge telescope with a mirror-average of 30 metres.
Here is an illustration to gaze at.
The main impressions from the space, but the space telescope Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990 it already images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler is seeking extra solar planets-mainly for such the inhabitable.
On 2 February 2011 was announced by NASA that 1235 planet candidates identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the last launch preparations for the space telescope Kepler documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) until 2018 on board the Ariane5 rocket fired into space.
The Primärspiegel of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: In light of the first stars and galaxies look after the Big Bang.
Scientists are working on the assumption that the South Pole of Mercury ice exists.
However, there is no reliable data, as the messenger far closer to the North Pole about the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades to hingedeutet that there are on the Mercury ice.
Launched by the 2004 messenger-special-the first around the Mercury, the scientists have now certainty.
