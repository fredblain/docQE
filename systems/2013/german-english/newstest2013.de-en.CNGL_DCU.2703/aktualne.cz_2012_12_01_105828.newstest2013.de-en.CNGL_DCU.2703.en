NKÚ C hef: Control of the black system failed as a result of the policy
The Czech Republic holds good bodies in connection with public contracts and adequate laws, however, is back in its application.
In talks for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied properly - and I think that this is not the case with us," commented on Kala the current situation.
Come to a similar conclusion seems to be a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practice for it leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas the so-called "black system."
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not trouble the entrepreneurs with controls - the system is now prohibited or permitted?
"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, the government cannot simply chairman, and the one whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work," Kala.
At the meeting of the committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other.
What was there in concrete terms?
It is a parallel examination, with which we began about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question that the European legislators are to decide how to handle public contracts. Count on the national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the review has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences. Generally speaking, laws are perhaps a little "strict and perfect," but the real application is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. We must also address the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? What is for you from this project?
Just such a common control could help that we stop at a constantly perfecting of laws and cutting and balancing of thresholds, if this obviously not very positive effects.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
It may even be that we in this way the system only with excessive "red tape" and those seeking loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the thresholds were higher.
They are talking about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the system work in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
With regard to the authorities, the German counterpart to the General Accounting Office, NKÚ built along the same lines as at home and also has a college that only slightly different. But both authorities are similar in principle.
Also the skills are comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, that is, that the courts in the individual Länder - and this is where the German system differs from our.
The BRH may only federal funding control what our public funds.
Public funds, which is administered by the districts and communities, with us. There are subject to the control of the Courts
What the German legislation, which is easier than our?
I would generally without specifics are reluctant to compare. Nevertheless, Germany in some ways, often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
This is perhaps because the auditors are better?
Surely not, but as I have said, I may not particularly like to such comparisons.
This is still, it should be noted that even a model for those countries which are also struggling.
Otherwise they would have nothing to work with our authority, isn't it?
What the Czech legislation, had for the revision of the law on procurement, you feel your authority have any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in power, it is in our tests have not yet.
Since our controls after, we must take place here with some delay.
Impact we feel so far more in the preparation of future controls - as we have the new control "detection of risks of inefficiency" and introduced with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analyzed, the changes will change of course, because the thresholds, the conditions for certain types of contracts were among the modified.
You see the passage of this bill rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption confirmed.
However, there is the difficulty that the rules are "strict" and cannot be met.
Under the previous rules are a test unterzogenen people to the winner (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, accountable to the regional council) that any breach of public procurement law is tantamount to violation of budgetary discipline.
It makes sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not believe in this way.
The system have to exclude those who want to attack and abusing the system and not penalize those who have made a formal errors, which affects the real decision-making not.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.
Where is the solution?
We say first of all, what is not successful.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS employers with controls of the so-called "black" system would lay-exactly what does that mean?
The black and system is now prohibited or permitted?
A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, the government cannot simply chairman, and the one whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work.
He can say: `We change the law and allow the matter, "but he cannot say that we are, as if nothing had happened.
The allocation law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and that is right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is tragic if the bidders with the best offer alone because of procedural irregularities.
The law will never be perfect, but it needs to be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing.
