Directives for inflating balloons, bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey of the oddest bank charges, has decided that the competition this year `absurdeste regulation or idea from the EU to hold workshop."
"on this idea has brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan, a 40% quota of women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, for dealing with the organization of this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities such is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
In the meantime women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are strictly a lower risk for the insurance companies.
"further incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
On the controversial EU regulations, including the binding to mixing bioethanol fuel in its wake naturschädigend is, the more the banning of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount this hazardous material, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, this year because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism 81st in the past, the ban on the use of the term "butter spreads" or even ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels usually are represented by one or more Member States (for example, currently the Czech Republic is trying, with veto threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that banana the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must show a "Krümmungsanomalie".
The European Commission argued with the argument that they only the mixed national standards harmonisiere, handicapping the trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables from the EU in the face of opposition from some countries were already weakened by pointing out that the previous directives would lead to a loss of food.
A candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU regulation last year in accordance with balloons to sales by pointing out that children under the age of eight air balloon must not without adult supervision of a aufblasen.
The EU citing an American study in accordance with balloons are the leading cause suffocation of children.
A similar restriction is already using Jahrmarktströten for children up to 14 years.
There are also curious incursions at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that the European officials themselves-anyone who has an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece cannot use the name Macedonia and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above-mentioned. Absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU, so that the maximum volume of food supplies to the day of our EU accession located on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic crossed then canned mushroom set volume, for which we have a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or the idea of funding for applications for grants.
But these ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are put at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will refund apply to the EU, "said in the autumn of 2004 the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument is that the grain harvest was very high and the government camp as a result of the so-called. Be intervention purchases were overcrowded.
As the Czech Republic, the EU should have a path to seaports according Palas paying hundreds of millions of euros to us.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered communities the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US DEU), specifically, it has to be the means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen act to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are somewhat in the Member States a target of criticism, the EU's efforts for regulation and hence effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition.
A serious problem, according to these experts tend to be the EU funding for projects absolutely have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations were forced by individual Member States.
Emotions here also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic similar to other Member States in Brussels for the right to use specific names traditional products have to fight this battle and not always wins.
The Czech Republic has been following a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky' defend Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dating back to the 19th century with us, but our manufacturers in" Tuzemák "had to rename.
The name rum can only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products are registered in the EU in the society of the world-famous cheeses feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinkens now the Karlsbad Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops.
With a EU brand, because the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or Hořicer roles pride.
