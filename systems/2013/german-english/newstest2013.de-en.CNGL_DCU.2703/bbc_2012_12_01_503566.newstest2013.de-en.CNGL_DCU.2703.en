Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants Norway enjoy the highest standard of living - and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country with the local appetite for something quite übelriechenden fish?
Take a selection überreifer cheeses.
They are in the midst of a crowd dirty feuchter platziere sports clothing.
And they leave that a week.
Just about has to imagine the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the great Delikatessen Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes and the intractable smell in the air, just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, depending on how stinkend its fish would like-up to a year in water ferments.
If Norway is the darkness of the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians flock to a party here in Fagernes, the, well, really very bestechenden speciality.
"you eat it raw and carries it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who was working in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General" the festival.
Around us people eat small fish cube and take large quantities of alcohol.
"Mansche people may Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can smell.
I cost some packaged.
If it avoids Rakfisk to bring the nose, it is not a bad thing, such as sushi, which has been a coach for quite a long time.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no Kühlmöglichkeiten and fish in a dense, wet salt water barrels this autumn.
He was then removed after a long Fermentierung in the deepest winter and undoubtedly under using alcohol consumed-tempered end.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work and forced to leave their country, mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly-more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, it was not too long ago was far richer than Norway, flows immigrants.
Rakfisk is seen as important as an essential, albeit strictly riechender part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive courts, which can buy here.
But everything here is really expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euro.
Norway fails often in the world press, and most people seems not to disrupt the.
Here are still hates it Anders Breivik to name - the racist right-wing extremists, the last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead it refers only to the "incident of 22 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Norway is primarily responsible for today's wealth since the early 1970's growth of the world's largest oil and Gasindustrien.
"but oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waiter who round trays with reifem Rakfisk distributed and the stechend with her long blonde hair and blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
As the saying goes, we are a sensible people.
Her English is exactly like that of most people here above reproach.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting.
Norway is handled very careful with its oil wealth, a large part of the industries yields will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, all with money raised it does not, Norway had closed its purse.
"As long as we ski in winter and in the summer, can go, we are happy," Anna says.
"and of course Rakfisk eat," it adds with unbeschwertem laughter.
I am in the snow and am Rakfisk to another court-I have enough.
This elk burger is definitely something else. I enjoy the juicy meat.
But in the evening the Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel where I logiere, is one of several Olympic venues resorts to organise a Rakfisk dinner where guests for the best-or perhaps the most challenging smell sense-fish can vote.
There is a live TV on which a bird served Showmaster, which is surrounded by tables with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What point number you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"here are our points, Havard."
The Grand Coalition and laughs.
A man is overwhelmed by his chair, possibly by the aquavit.
But it is perhaps the strict form of the whole fish.
