The most difficult job in the world: The human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euro, the winner of the Indonesian volcano risking their lives and health when they 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is the hell, and other work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mines workers who earn their living by they sulphur from the volcanic Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has every day to his Kraters down on the ground, where the rise out of the ground ausströmende schwefelhaltige gas in contact with air strengthened.
After he has extracted large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, transported it in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope paths of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, to a level of 2386 metres, but the exhausted agencies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the rate of turtles, and they have to be careful in their actions and keep the balance, so that they do not slip and fall.
You know that each step can cost as much as their lives, as happened to a French tourist who years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which they.
Top arrived, they pave the path between the tourists who they as circus affen photographs and run with the tedious serious baskets three kilometres to balance a mining company a little further down a total of 1850 metres set
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcanic and (never better) exploiting its workers, which they said 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilogram of sulphur.
For every 10,000 rupees (it sold 83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life, and for the manufacture of matches next fireworks products, cosmetics, Dynamit and even the bleaching of sugar is used.
"because we usually perform 70 kg, for every way we receive approximately EUR 46.000 rupees (3.8), Anto tells us," the normally three routes on the day.
It needs three hours for each route that he completely succeeded, at the end of the day he has but then 138.000 rupees (11.5).
What a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but the times of what he deserves to be with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest paid $15,000 rupees (1.2) a day, and the average monthly income is $2 million rupees (167), is very high," explained the winner who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
He earned $75,000 rupees (6.2) day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family returned after Banyuwangi, a village near the in Indonesia, and for a reason that is as important as the sulphur: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought it to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs and his eyes are often because of the toxic gases gereizt.
The 27 year-old Anto, after three years of his life on Kawah Ijen at risk, whose sulphur at him, even though he has already taken the first traces with a face mask and Spezialbrille covers.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs and his eyes are often because of the toxic gases from the volcanic gereizt.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here for another two years, because I open a shop or Spanish or French wants to learn," he promises in a more acceptable than English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but the life gestrafte young man could as tourist guides, waiters or work on the reception of the hotel, but instead he carried out the work of Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other agencies and is at two o'clock every morning because the sulphur will ausströmt at night, where his distinctive yellow color in the darkness bläulich shine.
The shadow challenging, he rises in the light up a small lamp in his helmet he has bought by his own money in the crater.
Some 400 winner shop on the crater bed the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite its huge profits, the mining company reduction in the sulphur not mechanized, in order to save costs, and provides the agencies working on their own account and paid by weight, no equipment.
They also get a share of the $30,000 rupees (2.5) award per photo apparatus, the Guardian this national parks, together with the entrance fee of EUR 15,000 rupees (1.2) by the tourist demand, the photography of the volcano and human Tragesel.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protested Madrusin, a stämmiger, 42 years old agencies, the three decades since leaving school on Kawah Ijen works.
He is in a position to take up to 110 kg and assurances that he continues, "As long as it is," he because the money for raising his three children aged between 10 and 18 years needs.
I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my life.
Even if the sulphur his throat burns the eyes itch, and if the wind suddenly and mine workers in the thick pillars einklemmt, the move from the crater, the men are so hard that nobody complains about serious diseases... of course alongside the normal breathing problems result, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, the by the weight of the baskets have distorted.
With the basket on his back is merely Unainik with its 53 years in the situation, 50 kg.
Every day break he and his associates 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano in three trucks on a goat path between the Gebüsch to camp in Tamansari transported in 18 kilometres away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because of the volcanic my whole life" was declared Unainik, when he opens his mouth wide, where some teeth missing.
The grandfather of his five children works with his 30 years as sulphur winner.
As time passes, but the poverty generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: Those who as human burden esel on Kawah Ijen work.
