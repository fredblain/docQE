With Bitcoin is possible without pay and selling bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange transactions identified on the basis of central banks, and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies is a political vision tangible: The belief that the current monetary system of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
This is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto (one name) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency convertible (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for the safe exchange as BitTorrent, the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network were already collected 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to $2 before he has recovered to around $10 today (prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the real world trade currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown.
Bitcoin describes as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "compete with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that will be used to move forward in a video game, win or by the Games can buy (and sometimes zurücktauschen).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade every time controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin are all network hubs at the same time, repository of the Court of auditors, monetary issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Any transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for any pay, ensuring the anonymity.
A number of related to this transaction data is electronically signed by a double Verschlüsselungssystem.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the whole network there are widespread public accounts Court Paper.
The decisive step is to sign this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task on the computers will be launched, with the winners, a kind of temporary Zentralbankier is adding the privilege to cope with these additional line.
It is a Zerstückeln the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The "taking" the new computer transaction and submit their a number, before it `zerhackt."
The aim is to find the number that a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this figure has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is linked to the chain of all other transactions in the long term, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to cheat twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money will pay, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without link, because they have different fingerprints.
The computers, the task, 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation this reward will regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins are therefore limited to 21 million in circulation, but to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, which leaves some room for maneuver...
In addition, the difficulty of the task with every improving computing power increases.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and Bitcoin assets stolen.
"the problem is not the real Minutes," Pierre Noizat insured, who has just introduced Paymium that a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin uses.
The ECB also reported on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
Cash also, however, these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia deny such donations.
By others as the WordPress blog platform will accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyzed by the Weizmann Institute in Israel the Paper and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins not circulating.
A "Mega Schlussverkauf" was launched in November.
"thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," looks forward Jon Holmquist who works for the company Coinabul the Bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin verifying the transactions, which are cheaper.
Furthermore, the owner managed its identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system can easily implemented, dealers and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
They simply need to give an address by a telephone "photographed and recognized" can be assured, Pierre Noizat, which is that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend, in the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems designed to be reviewed.
"It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
In its report, the ECB, which different today than well-respected risks in the event of a success to reassess its currency.
