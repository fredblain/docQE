After the Court of Appeal confirmed the judgment of the United States, which does not recognize the group's debt restructuring Vitro that has been achieved on a trade konkurs in Mexico, will be a more sinister precedent for each national companies with operations in the neighbouring country has created the payment problems.
You could say that the procedures for survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition by the judge's ruling handed down on 15 June Harlin Hale on court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas that Mexican companies to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river bravo helpless.
But the decision opens the door to largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, for three inconsistencies to the Supreme Court of the United States.
While pointing out that the judges creditors the Bankruptcy Law must be subject to the United States, says the Appeal of the Fifth circuit based in New Orleans, first of all, that the main proceedings in the trade konkurs dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for corporate default with länderübergreifendem profile is unknown.
Indeed, the United Nations to this end, the model law for the unification of the international trade law and the American Law Institute, was used as a arbitrators.
Secondly, the ruling stipulates that without the voices of societies to recognize the liabilities in the estate, the branches of Vitro with its parent company, did not have the necessary majority to restructure the debt would have been reached.
But this is the possibility of the Mexican laws recognized.
Indeed, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme.
There are a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities under the group companies from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for trade bankruptcies) confirmed.
It is also true that after deducting the votes of the branches of Vitro creditors, creditors in the courts of the United States against Vitro complained, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had reached a majority.
The vote would be 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into consideration by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, there are Vitro blame for his difficult situation from 2008 during the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country hits.
That is why the Gonzalez Sada family before the same Court of Appeal contradiction to the vote in plenary, i.e. from all judges voted, because only three of them.
It is not granted, the Cerciorare-appeal, calling for a review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Schwerwiegende in this case is that the court has set aside a document by the Mexican government under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), what the procedure carried out by Vitro within the framework of the law on trade described bankruptcies, and what it is pointed out that it must adhere strictly to the agreements signed between the two countries had kept the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law to comply with the United States.
The country will also pointed out that the principles of the United Nations Commission on the subject to international trade, i.e. the rules laid down in cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
