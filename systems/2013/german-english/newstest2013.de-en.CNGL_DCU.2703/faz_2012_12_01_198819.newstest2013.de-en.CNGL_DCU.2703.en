"trademark protection" in China: If Puma and Armani suddenly be Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
There is an officially registered name in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
But she enjoys protection as long as the real name of employers not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether will get justice.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Patt layer, lawyer in the services Taylor Wessing, which is specialised in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The clones are already a few additional letter so that they can register their trademarks.
So just Lu, Gucci, Prada, Gucci, Prada-Kny register.
German companies also are legally copied in this way, such as sports equipment manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a file with registration of trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company the trademark Zegna DF Puma protect, an art names, which is also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese world champion in the copying and injured are intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities there are mehrstöckige department stores, which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
Stalemate hole cases but on behalf of his clients are different: He does to deal with the fact that Chinese companies from the trademarks agency officially given the right to use a name, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
These women are that the rich men angling.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"That is deprive, it must be fought," calls for stalemate hole.
"The brand is watered down the Alleinstellung disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and the Prozesskosten the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the market research company CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year's third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But erased dubious entries in brands register are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
Up to nine years can drag on the procedure, with an uncertain outcome.
Stalemate hole reports of cases in which the court complaints prompted because, after the long duration of the beanstandete name to "market had become reality."
If the plaintiff misfortune, he must have the Plagiator even pay money, because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, the company that recently took over the German pump concrete planter Putzmeister.
The Chinese must still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyers Geely, originally a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturers Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous Crocodile look in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The trademarks agency CTMO in Beijing to that there is 2010 for lack of staff and space equipment shortages.
Last year, the "emergency but normality in the business."
It is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure has declined by 22%.
Almost 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than in the previous year.
But in the office are still waiting 81.500 objections to carry out.
Address it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
It is a record and means that the list of China on the tenth consecutive Neuanmeldungen all over the world, shares the authority.
The line of reasoning would also apply to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011 are 1.8 billion yuan in fees earned.
Simplified, this means that any notification on average 1280 yuan or costs EUR 160.
Address it costs much joy, as the case of the German family business mountain shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been struggling against a Chinese Plagiator.
Although the Germans achieve that was lifted the illegal manufacture of imitation of motor vehicle parts.
But the counterfeiters secured to the Chinese brand rights joy.
We missed the family name, as in Germany could not be protected, said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of joy mountain Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademarks agency CTMO rejected the opposition of the Munich as well.
In the next two bodies, joy mountain may be right, but the Prozessgegner fighting until today.
We have to höllisch careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "the procedure is extremely expensive and is costing us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs would be difficult to quantify, the company archive have even one hundred years old files they need in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, offered joys of opposition in vain a "high six-figure euro amount" to resolve.
"this shows you how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even after Europe zurückzuschwappen.
Then, if there Imitatoren vulnerable brands.
It was a Chinese manufacturer in Germany the name pleasures mountain on shoes and leather.
This area of business, the company has already abandoned, but he could avert the registration.
"You höllisch must be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole rates German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should "everything somehow register is worth protecting, including in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if joy mountain last act of his trademark dramas too, then it is the other side should pay royalties on their own behalf, said Wentzler.
Or we will segment in question squeezed out of the market.
