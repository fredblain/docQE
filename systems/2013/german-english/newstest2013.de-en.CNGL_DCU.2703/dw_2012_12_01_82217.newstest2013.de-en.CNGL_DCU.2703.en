Szabo: "German must play greater role '
Germany has been in the abstained from voting on the opening of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US European relations,'re Berlin to a narrow diplomatic level.
German wave: Germany had indicated earlier this week that it violates the request for observer status for the Palestinians were to vote at the United Nations.
But then abstained from Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo, Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, but be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany abstained also, when it came to enforce a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Germany find it hard to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it's true.
This is because it is surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that was swept away by the US gemanaged, towards a German foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are also among the fronts.
It expects them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to.
I believe that they are still remember their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, like France or Britain.
Which means a "normal" foreign policy as it from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to national interests to take positions that are independent of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN had?
On the one hand, Germany major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, there must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not offending.
This will play a role in any case.
But I would not to attach too much importance to the, this is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by chose to abstain on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
Consequently, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.
Because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international players and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, have a clear message for a veto.
There are some differences between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always exists because of American domestic politics.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government this position publicly, of course, cannot represented.
I believe that the real differences are not so great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so upbeat of Netanyahu's policy.
It is difficult for Germany to its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the most important partner in the EU's position on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position.
This is precisely what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, in view of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans are well aware that they have a more independent role to play.
Germany itself is in its role as a major global players-Germany wants to play a major role in the first place?
Or is the lead Germany still difficult?
Germany is not accustomed to this is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it hard to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany will adopt a greater role, a variety of German feelings.
It is not just the Germans.
This is the old problem: You would not be surrounded by hostile countries.
Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be susceptible to a variety of neighbors and opinions and it is not easy.
Now, the US influence in European politics continuously, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who is otherwise?
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them, making them even more unpopular, c'est la vie!
