Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life '
The Weltenbummler of Basketballs, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was the basket sport for more than 60 years and has visited the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of history of the country's Basketballs as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was killed by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair was Rexes 6 years, either as part of this sport players lower classes, players in the first National League, and director's agent in BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My life I went to the basketball, even several put many hats at the same time, when I President of BSN, CEO and President of the Association was in the 1990s," remembered Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all with photographs and memories of his long career decorated and they show.
Bayamón at the heart
The emotionalsten memories are those who are skeptical about his time in the middle of the 1950s Vaqueros as players until 1982, where his 15-year anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or directors of the club celebrated.
"These were my best years I have enjoyed most, because I was part of the Vaqueros eight championships since 1967 it as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach privilege.
There were many rewarding years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted a championship in 1981, the year of Debüts of Jerome Mincy in BSN.
From then took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good managers, "Reyes says.
I remember that I worked as coach Gene Bartow here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m major players.
Möchtest you him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow, then the Freiwurf specialists Raymond Gausse, en masse, and was one of our best Werfer.
I remember, as he said that, if Mincy facilitated a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another would provide.
The championship the Vaqueros with Gausse he was granted, but from a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At the time he preferred his enforcement and Mincy to enjoy in the national team.
I remember when we first won at the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, the fourth place where we should have been documented what bronze, if not this Canadian referee would have been the last us Spielzug repeated for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won 2004 against the dream team at the Olympics.
But my favorite is the team the Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we gold in 1991, and the US team won a fight, as when they won bronze at the World Cup against us.
In the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas López, Fico and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also included the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, León (Francisco brothers and Edgar) and Mario Morales, the 1990 "Quixote" could not be because of a knee injury.
A team that perhaps in terms of figures was not the best, but with which we won a gold medal and the us great pleasure, those of was paved vorolympischen Turniers Neuquén, Argentina in 1995.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner schedule as a substitute for players because of the events in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all forecast.
Who was the best players of Puerto Rico?
This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
Its figures at international level tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated as Piculín at this level.
And that, without taking account of his career in the different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
As we had a number of good trainer Julio Toro, `Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys like the work of Leo Arill well.
What glaubst you is the best thing that you have achieved in the Association?
I was part of the team's most successful era between 1988 and 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams involved in a season.
What remains to be done you?
There are things that I have introduced, such as the regionalisation of lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play on their territory and only in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children many unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the result of mandatory training and courses for trainers, table, officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you today?
I listen to music, see my time in YouTube videos of music, enjoy my grandchildren, and I am going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the society my wife Isabel, who has always been on my side.
