Šimon Ornest: Do we want to collect positive energy on our concerts
What do you think that is due to take place in less than a month of doom?
This is one of those disasters reports, we the people so much like to start up again.
With our band The TAP TAP let us more poked fun at and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to halt the doomsday or prevent.
In December realize you also a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.
Can you imagine our readers the project?
It is a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung plan that we have two years.
To this end, we want to use the Marketingpotenzial of the Mayan calendar, the end is forecast at 11:10 a.m. on 21 December.
The day before, on 20 December, from 21:00 a.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of the Maya calendar ends.
Where this idea come from?
Originally come from me, then we have the idea together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta.
In this connection, we would not enough positive energy, in order to prevent the doomsday, together with the public, but we also want to consider in the state we give our children the world.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have a unique range of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key supporters against the doomsday developed, with their purchase on www.e - tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The TAP TAP, together with other performers also known as the anthem against the doomsday entitled "doomsday is included."
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will ring out on the Benefizkonzerten?
Of course, at the end, provided that all work and not the doomsday...
The national anthem should be sung by all actors at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns together in a Direktschaltung by Czech television broadcast.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, which also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How can you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other figures of the Czech culture scene, that implies that we achieve many Benefizveranstaltungen and concerts...
We are trying to these people involved in our projects.
It was clear that are most interested in cooperating with us, and have fun in it.
What purpose will be of great benefit to the proceeds of concerts against the doomsday?
For the establishment of the barrier free education center Studeo, on which we are already six years working together with the club TAP in Jedlička Institute.
The pupils the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by teachers who help them in various leisure activities.
Since the students do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute to create a separate buildings in which we then with this project.
In every concert, several groups and performers.
According to what criteria you have chosen this?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You know everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "events" are also planned for the future?
We are in May for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert with interesting guests we are preparing a interesting program.
Next year we would also like to arise in the Czech house in New York, and I personally, if we are already in the United States, this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans are not just small, you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
However, the TAP TAP is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with this travel logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the baggage area. We must also, of course, many instruments koffer and other baggage mitschleppen...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes even surprised me.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility as they deal with disabled people, etc..
How have you seen these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we are witnessing the in Russia that were in the east is still in its infancy.
In Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. It is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair is traveling alone in the city center.
It is not even, of course, that there is a person in a wheelchair lift vorlässt, for example.
Fortunately, there will also be created clubs who are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things, where we are...
To say that there is an improvement in the situation also always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal for people with severe disabilities too independently in the public sphere, go into the museum, can use toilets, etc..
But it is not normal for a larger group of disabled people, and we are actively involved in social life with the band The TAP TAP slightly ahead of the West.
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when important from our ranks athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers, things will start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken personalities.
The TAP TAP is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What did you in 1998, motivated to start a band?
Then I began as carers in Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something hard.
And since I myself am musicians including. Saxofon games, I have established a music company, along with a colleague.
Na, and, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs).
The band was known but only in recent years, or I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known Sängern helped us; we have also started to campaign actively for us.
We realized that if something, and this is not outwardly, their own performance in a sense does not exist.
Thanks to the EU aid we can also good teachers, high-quality equipment, etc...
It is your goal, but with The TAP TAP so far?
From the outset, I felt the potential that can things in a different way.
In Showbusiness today often copied the other.
In its own way, it is only logical as anything new viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that TAP TAP is one of them.
The first impression of the spectators usually has, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned nature, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities do something, this is not just a step forward for themselves, but for the whole of society.
It was also helpful for this success that you are a strong leader, as you can tell by many people?
If you want to make something good, you cannot compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline.
But I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come with romantic ideas, and if they discover that they have test twice a week, must overcome stages of preparation and spend a lot of time travel on concert, then the enthusiasm among many quickly extinguished.
But the way things work everywhere, in every band, the serious work and wants something.
At present, The TAP TAP twenty members.
How many of them were from the outset, since 1998.
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. You cannot prevent.
Who has the will and the desire to do, we always welcome.
