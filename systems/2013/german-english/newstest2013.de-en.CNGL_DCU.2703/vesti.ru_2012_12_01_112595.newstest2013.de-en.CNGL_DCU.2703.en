Born in outer space
World at risk.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
Karawanen of space ships with Erdbewohnern on board are on the search for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important issue is how we in the bubbles or spare planet can breed?
There are many choices I do not think so.
De facto, there are only two real planet that we could at least hypothetical inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomical star mountain Institute Vladimir Surdin.
But while the conditions on Mars are comparatively lebensfreundlich, there is a Venus on the surface temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only in height or Venus in orbit, in space, possible.
The researchers first dealt with the issue of reproduction in space in terms of the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments were carried out with plant.
The fourth generation of peas, not at all was produced in the orbit of the irdischen species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, tiny fruit flies in detail (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 Wachteleier were sent out into space, we want to see how the bubbles on the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chicks.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chicks must be stopped; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explained the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew.
Without firm underground überschlugen the chicks wild.
Ten hours later stumpften fully the instincts of the babies.
The chicks not responded to light and Laute.
They then simply died four days later.
"twice we chicks and slip it, simply because it is impossible to work with them," there is Vladimir Sychew for a failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
But will be based on the Biosatelliten "Bion" only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that are already fertilized were sent into space.
In principle it was nothing special.
"That was just with the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only one experiment, and research needs to be continued," said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the space rats were young.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could have not been resolved.
The task is difficult.
Animals, snatched from their natural habitats, simply cannot follow their Fortpflanzungstrieb.
Unlike animals could man the in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstraktem thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
Such experiments on ethical considerations are not carried out.
But women already fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk, Tereshkova.
The Wertvollste that mankind is the female body.
Our Möwe flew and nobody in the world can answer the following question: Would it preserves the space flight?
Will they can bring a child into the world after this flight?
"after all, nobody answered this question," says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after its space flight, gave the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988 brought forth the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which was twice in orbit and even doing work outside the space vehicle, a son.
Nevertheless, it remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet must humanity for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the produce artificial Gravitation.
The cosmonaut's Hydrolabor in preparation center is a compulsory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for work in the open space.
Water is the bubbles.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is an alien environment, but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testify of that life in the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child, approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit is water, and that it can easily become accustomed to water.
In principle, the logical, as the cradle for the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget," says something Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
So while the bubbles for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of bubbles, the stomach and basin muskulatur is very quickly and it is also the ability to extract the baby.
Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could, for example, in a Spezialkammer in order to extract the baby.
"But what happens?" is the important issue of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand the child needs also artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung to feel the skeleton and muscles, the organism cannot train.
A newborn child cannot as an adult in the orbit to training in a burden to be invested.
It is simply the lack, which is vital for his life.
"this experiment, which we make together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will lead to a disabled person, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world," says the head of the Institute for medical and biological Bioethikkommission problems ran, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in outer space just theory.
At some point, but they reality, if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space.
