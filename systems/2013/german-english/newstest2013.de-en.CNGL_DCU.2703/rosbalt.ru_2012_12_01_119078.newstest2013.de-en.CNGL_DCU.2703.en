Their own taste rather than cultural rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburg vanguard" project, the city dwellers, which form the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the select list, already high-ranking Petersburg art scene, whose achievements and often go beyond the city's borders, without recognition in Europe to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the "artists Kirill Miller.
The entire city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded, dressed in red in a Russian museum, sometimes at the summer, sometimes in scene-meeting or Vernissagen.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also be issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of Petersburg vanguard in the late 80s and early 90s.
It is also a man of the city and confirmed by his presence on the streets smiles in the face and his fellow citizens is causing them for good humor.
He recently, at a Drehorgel and became the Petersburg Drehorgel players, as it is for these difficult role in terms of artists dasein, his philosophy and his image was adrift.
- Kirill, why you are always in red and not, for example, in yellow or TÃ¼rkis in the city?
I have chosen the color red as fashion designers, which deals with the optics and image.
In this world is red the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In the society calls on everything, something from the gray standard, aggression and bad behavior.
But let me by my provocations to meet with the people.
All my last provocation was an invitation to talks.
- When wusstest you that you must be painter?
- In an exhibition in the culture palace Newskij, and my work were issued.
I realized that I must go this way.
That was the period of old free, but not officially recognized painter to end, and then new and free painters as I was incomprehensible.
I friendly with the new generation of painters, with representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; hence, "Puschkinskaja 10," and then was first conclusion.
Me prefers the theater, fashion, music, everything except in literature.
- And all the united in your kind-hospital... - It was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied an area in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical, artistic club to the renovation of the Boheme, the House of Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born: N.O.M. Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" there.
String and his friends sang simple songs to play-back close jersey and contributed to them was the today mature composer Igor Wdowin.
As the group began to play live, it was "Leningrad."
Costumes mountain facilitated many programs before the time of `Halli Galli."
We gave them costumes mountain, and it started his great career, but the foundations he learned.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club `Griboedov "have their origin in the clinic.
There were our staff and stem passengers.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, there have been in the press, a survey on the award "figures of our city."
I won in the category of "artist of the Year Award, and I was at the height.
It is not easy to work in new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You may be famous, without a cultural contribution.
- your work has a distinctive style.
- Many my images are real pearls and express clearly the timeliness and ferocity of the idea.
I am an exhibition with the theme of "The Russian museum as clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was socially, but now it pains and fear that to be the case.
In a clown blur all this and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world by making that everyone has to dress up fully.
Now respects everyone on the clothes and the Outer and not focused on the inside of the people.
But perhaps we cannot provide a person, but he should face spucken.
The illusion disappear by the dress up.
- Before recently we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgel player. - A City of Culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can be commercial art nice?
- It must be careful, respectful and complimentary commercial art.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Earlier formed the human large groups: The Bohemiens loved one and the other the ordinary people.
Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please all.
I am not 100 dollar note that everyone likes.
Will you consider who have now fallen.
Now, every cult star around 100 supporters.
- On the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand.
- At him, abandoned women, there is a role for the sexually-social sphere.
300 people come for cultural reasons and not 10 thousand, so there are fewer management, money, and anything goes.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has already been achieved.
In my youth I have such pictures painted in a gathering with the works of Falk and even in a series Larionow.
I began with images, which normally only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It reads: Intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption does not have a culture that is quite another.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture, which I support.
- Kirill, what is lacking Petersburg?
- the best culture experts.
Saying that servant of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real czar the tsars may not be understood it was different, because a lot of culture, but it is understood that right experts necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good adviser.
In St. Petersburg, we have those who could be experts, but the road has been closed, as it requires hochrangigerer experts, the former properly evaluate and open the path for them.
Now only their own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters to find other museums.
- What is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow, there is far more culture and breeding ground.
On our stones art find it difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural fertile ground for example we now have more writers and readers, and this is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
For us, these are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded through grants the city of St. Petersburg
