"The large and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While legislators and civil rights activist discuss what the laws on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals already with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to maintain a money at home remaining families to earn.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which each Arbeitsmigrant a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, must take.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants in the service sector, in the local housing industry and want to work in the retail sector.
However, should the tests over time according to Föderaler Migrationsbehörde compulsory for all migrant workers in the future.
We must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must both for maintaining and extending the work permit be proved.
Exceptions only for citizens of countries where Russian official language.
Also excluded from this law are people who their education certificates and diplomas received before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Point problem and protecting the rights
The whole of examination under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian people's hospitality, the Moscow State University, University of St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all the cities; in Russia have already been already opened centres more than 160.
The initiative was the introduction of the tests by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migrationsbehörde support.
Human rights activists, on the other hand, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press the following question: What is it really?
What changes, the provision, language skills to deliver, both for the Russians and for guest workers?
Above all, say the Migrationsbehörde spokesman, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labor.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migrationsbehörde representation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
But their rights must be protected before departure.
Only an organised recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without working, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably face people with bad intentions, which it under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow cabin, where he stay with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day will collapse.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"at home will promise you one thing, and cheated on arrival you will get their passports and do not receive the promised pay," the head of the Headquarters confirmed for migration of Tajik Migrationsbehörde, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not whose chief.
Nevertheless, many people give the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money that they not only do not speak the language of the destination country, but also in their own language hardly able to express in writing.
Of course, this is not their fault, so much as the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a sound basic education.
Because there are not even in their families money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and Schulsachen.
As a teenager these children to take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they are.
"you fühlst humiliated and degraded."
Human rights activists stress on the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
"welcome" or "Entry prohibited for unauthorised persons '
Many migrants in Russia, confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status.
The reason, bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents largely fake and we are not registered, and then result cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,", the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"spare no expense for false papers '
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates, which are educated the language tests certify, have already been of members of the Federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.
The fraudulent papers were printed with an ordinary Farbdrucker.
Of course, the new owners this is true: Every migrant, hoped to be able to save as the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and human rights activists agree.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers who fall through the test for the first time, only promise that they receive time for a language rate.
In addition, newcomers without language skills, offered jobs in areas where there is no active necessary understanding with people.
