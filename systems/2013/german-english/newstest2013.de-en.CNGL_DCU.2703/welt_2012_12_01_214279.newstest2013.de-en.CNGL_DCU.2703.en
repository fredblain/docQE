The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia law as a basis is hotly contested.
The Egyptian President sparte not with emotion.
We must create the transition.
"and that it is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but especially well the Coptic Christians, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular.
In a confused, because they all hopelessly divided opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on Nile of grace the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had, Mohamed Morsi said almost entschuldigend, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily cut and expanded his powers, "in order to save the revolution."
But what the 61 years engineer, which bears a doctorate of the American University of Südkalifornien, really wants to save as Egyptians, the world is not very much aware.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles that dominated by the Islamist 100-person Constituent Assembly as a night, 15, stündigen Parforceritt were pushed through, partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says, the jurisdiction grounds on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is meant by "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists the vague wording and the attendant legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law will use.
That suggests at least a newly hinzugeführter Article: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al Ashar University zurate, the country's main Islamic institution with great clout throughout the Sunni Islam.
It does not have, but it may mean that the clergy overseeing the legislation, which would lead to de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should continue to remain.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The government should also, it says in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morals and values."
The wording is legally so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even could control the content of cinema and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article, writes explicitly equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy to insult or to slander.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Also dubious is the wording of the "insulting people," is forbidden.
Is there has been a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of Leader?
Interpretation, as much in the design, Morsi to sign before and after his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down, the Charter, before it can be put into effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will prevail," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said, the draft Constitution belong "on the scrapheap of history."
Via Twitter Kurznachrichtendienst he accused supporters Morsi, they want to lead a "coup against democracy.
"If he devoted the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the opposition Yasser Said.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brothers arrested is not yet," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not be that it is going to monitor invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organised Muslim Brotherhood inflated to Gegendemonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayers on the other Nilufer before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, attended and chanted "the people calling for the application of the law of God."
They invited by Morsi: "Säubere the country!" and protested: "the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where anything began, would's conditions.
The Morsi's supporters clearly did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists is safe.
"The word `human rights is not even"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this speed up the constitutional process that you have gone until February and should involve all social forces.
Of the 48 years human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because it human rights are indivisible.
That is what he was convicted, imprisoned, beaten.
"and now the word `human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complained in conversation with the "world" on Sunday.
Morsi power expansion in all three branches in the state, the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and Egypt in a new dictatorship.
"rather than strengthening civil society. The President de facto repeal it," complained Saeda.
But without civil society organizations cannot work a democracy.
Saeda feels alone, even by the international community, the ideological direction campaign on Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could be revenge.
A protestor in the Tahrir warns: "You gebährt a monster that it cannot control."
