The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court on voluntary work on the law.
This decision, a lively debate in public.
It is interesting, to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions.
Under this concept is a state is trying to understand where the manufacturers to compete with imports cheaper goods in the economic, making the competition "unterbietet," thereby grab a larger share of the market and to increase its profit.
On a large scale does this mean for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or to abandon their business. The result is a comparable high unemployment in countries with high labor costs.
As the capital no social responsibility and, therefore, bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, necessarily increase public spending.
This situation is made even worse by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and by the overall economic and social damage caused by them to replace.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are not at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to reduce the social artificially level of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words: Governments provide its own people without regard to the social consequences from the private sector.
This is reflected in amendments to existing laws.
Objective of these measures is to force its own people, particularly in the field of pay to accept the dictates of private capital.
This is partly by financial constraints in long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by limiting the workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, and widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who are no longer able to feed through their own work.
The number of people are already in the millions.
In the wake of the increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it regularly to cases in which workers are paid so little that the state must increase their income until the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures virtually all EU southern will undoubtedly come to exactly the same situation, in which the people under pressure from a disastrous crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or for a pittance to languish on the fringes of society and hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
The natural question that arises here is where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, is only the poverty from one country to another, or the capital remains altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages.
This is all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state cannot capital involved in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
The private, parochial, insists on its position that the state cannot intervene lenkend in the economy.
But we must ask whether the capital's policy and thus affect the entire state in their own selfish sense or even.
This is a clear answer: Yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation in the fight against corruption, mutual advantage, a legislation, in the criminal virtually everything, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the reality is that a State Department due to lack of finances private, with the industry verflochtene legal companies charged with drawing up draft law.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence will no longer from the people, as the Western constitutions, but powerful financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
Obviously liberal democracies are currently quickly in a situation like they Appian in his work on the crisis at the time of the Roman Republic Caesar and Pompeius `describes: "The government was that has long been the disintegration and the offices have been filled with violence.
Against bribes by unlawful or fraudulent use of benefits with Stein and sword.
The corruption has grown incontinent, and the people have already bought votes on election, people with "..." character bewarben not for offices, so that the state had "no consul for eight months due to this decline..." You really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine is a dictatorship in this difficult situation, and that a strong man should be chosen "... Appian is thought to Pompeius, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, which democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, is based in today's society, as in antiquity the reckless preference of their own advantage, without paying attention to societal interests.
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who do not in any way seek deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism we must therefore in the reckless economic liberalisation systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current condition, the demise of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, already in the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the social and humanitarian disasters, we are already witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and contemporary history, in complete ignorance of.
The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systembedingt.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that the capital increase the state involvement in the economy, increase the influence of citizens to the government and the monopoly of private capital in society in the country.
