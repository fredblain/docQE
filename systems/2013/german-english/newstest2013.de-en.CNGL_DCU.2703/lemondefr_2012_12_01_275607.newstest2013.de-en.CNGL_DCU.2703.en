"It is strange, as the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures," witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was from him a thorough study of the embezzlement in connection with the contracts to revealed Straßenbauarbeiten in Quebec, the former Prime Minister only reluctantly agreed.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.

The next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city, has resigned.
He is suspected, repeatedly to have received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Explicitly accused, the Montreal Straßenbauamts, engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.

He himself has several years in Montreal 3% of the value of the contracts to received an associated with the Mafia mediator paid, Montreal gave the money to the Union, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has in the 2000 "s everywhere he had his hand in by more than 88 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) province of parties, especially in power at the time gewesenen liberals.
He also acknowledged that an illegal fund-raising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau organised.
Sanitation contracts, the costs of him have been artificially inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former Bauingenieur Gilles Surprenant this before the Commission has described in detail: In ten years, he received from builders gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736.000 in exchange for sanitation contracts, which will cost it artificially.
Other officials of the Straßenbauamtes have admitted that they could schmieren by the bills with false additional services artificially by 30-40% aufblähten.

From the investigation, which ultimately will be carried out, "she says that it" a thread, which allows the functioning of Ameisen unterwanderten system to understand in order to stop the evil and denounce the perpetrators."
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive."
We are in the process, the wound, but would need only for Montreal certain investigation unit, and supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to make clean.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau, notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is particularly concerned about the role of "the representatives on the tactic in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
Based on a percentage of 70% black in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec witzelt it: "I was told that it was only a weak simulacrum of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, which he says would not change the situation: "As long as the campaign spending will not be strictly limited, black money circulating in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public procurement and funding of parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by the things with courage, we can go to the House on a more solid basis with more controls and rebuild laws."
