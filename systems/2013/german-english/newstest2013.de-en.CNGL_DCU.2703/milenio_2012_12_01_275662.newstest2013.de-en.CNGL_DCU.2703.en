Cause of a dying of AIDS is today a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the outcome of the inquiry, confirmed HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says on the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."
He hid it in his family.
He decided to look just about his illness and started to inform; and this with such use that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of unity of the HIV Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) live for 22 years, was at the beginning of the 1990s, when it was hard to imagine many doubts, stigma was a few treatment and more.
Then it avoided even the director of the IMSS to a clinic, "because it into a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people are still in the clinic who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already damage and their immune system has run out of steam, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the publication of AIDS in the world. In other words, the date of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient's treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information in April this year was supported by a respected scientific publication.
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life on the level of damage to the immune system of people at the start of treatment law, and that the greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years in a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that, who at the age of 25, the diagnosis is HIV positive, "can be easily 75 years old in this sense, as long as it is under control," the expert said.
In order to be able to view this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality has significantly reduced in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (reduced annual report ONUSIDA)), it is true that since the appearance of the AIDS 60% of patients covered by the national database died.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until May this year are already 187 deaths, however, said that it is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why so people still die?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no problems of drug supply. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they are unaware of their infection status, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a resounding statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us if they have already an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, and all persons, where necessary, massive screening tests must be provided."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients as Fabrizio, which has carried out its test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS stage and even the Kaposi Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we want to hear nothing.
"If I was going to die, then burst," says one to three times in my case.
The amendment was to improve, I ernähre me well, treibe sport and take the drugs.
Today his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life as anyone else.
"I have a lot of work, it does, an active, but responsible Sexleben, I am on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio, which agreed to include his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco to share with his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global AIDS day afraid.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner we know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they will learn how to as all people can live responsibly.
The news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizen big holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which adopted the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the certain places "was the distribution of condoms; previously, they were actually increased individually, now give us with a hundred little packages, which already is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
One of the risk for new infections among young people.
"Why do you need?" is a widespread Spottfrage of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to suspend assured the correspondent.
He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in issuing equipment in public toilet facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted the promiscuity.
They are not paid the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether under his administration would be distributed condoms.
"sexuality is not enough; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it more succinctly.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is seen nationally in fourth place new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13 in terms of HIV.
92% of Ansteckungsfälle takes place through sex, 6% on the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are registered for each case 4 or 5 people who do not know.
