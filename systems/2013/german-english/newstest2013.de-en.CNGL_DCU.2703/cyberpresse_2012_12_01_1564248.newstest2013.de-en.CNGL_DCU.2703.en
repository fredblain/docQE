A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud.
The latter is the Brennan Center for a myth, confirmed that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republicans "lawyers have in 10 years in the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: These new rules will adversely affect voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly as a democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedure for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives seen in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require that the voters a photograph card and present proof of US citizenship.
In addition, by these laws will also shorten the time frames for the early vote annulled, the right to register as voters on election day, and nationals, denied the right to vote for a court acts.
Before the elections of 2006, no US state of the electorate, requires a photograph card appearances.
Indiana was the first federal state, which has made such a demand.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.
Over the last two years, they encouraged in 34 states bills, which voters are forced to draw a photograph card.
It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal ID card to the Health Insurance Card.
Indeed have 11% of US citizens, i.e. enfranchised 21 million people do not photograph card issued by a government authority of their state.
Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012 does not have such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary card.
Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately affected.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35.000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary photograph card.
This goes further.
The students, which are regarded as voters who cast their votes more for democratic candidates, it is not permitted in several states, to use their photograph card issued by its establishment.
On the other hand, allow the same states members of Angel-or hunting, the more for the Republican side to choose to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
In 2004, a federal state for the voters demanded proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, such a requirement.
For 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at the Hispanic votes to limit.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters, the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators have 2011 in eight states laws, which promoted the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups, to help those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections contributed to approximately 10 million citizens to register.
Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
Moreover, the Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at to shorten the period of the early vote.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida were 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance.
By contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate that voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened in order to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were partly limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the her a photograph card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly hinder the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws adopted and see them as influencing the results as a clear goal in the pivotal states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of 270 votes in the Electoral College is needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that this legislative changes to the electoral system a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: These new rules will adversely affect voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly as a democratic system of the United States.
