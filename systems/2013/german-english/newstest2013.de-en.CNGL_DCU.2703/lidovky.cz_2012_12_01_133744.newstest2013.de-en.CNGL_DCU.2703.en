The film Argo: If Hollywood's worst, call
In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution which for decades the Patronat on his regime had maintained.
For the US government, there have been no positive way out of this situation, they could not afford to throw away, the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the creation of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent the hostage fiasco in violent attempt exemption only made matters worse.
The captured diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government had been.
The fate of the hostages, a wave of solidarity at home and antiiranischer sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter in the presidential election against Ronald Reagan in 1980.
The film Argo of director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode this history, a small part of the US victory.
Just before the occupation of the message, six staff the flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA has succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; helped them a "story to Verdeckung their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film Drehorte stabes allegedly in the country for a science-fiction film visited.
Combination of Genres
The experts for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywood.
So that the cover was credible, article on this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of different film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie," i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film levels of the atmosphere - on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen from Teheran (in the title sequence ikonische contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there is no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and easy überspitzt therefore.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions, men in suits at the meeting table, the official fluren, on the phone...
Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable relaunch his career.
From a belächelten actor has become a respected director, as well as actors, he is no longer the objective ironic comments.
ARGO is his third movie The after the whodunit No children's (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is not in the Afflecks first film, the native of Boston director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was being one of the characteristics that the previous films this contrasted with the standard Hollywood director.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran played by Canada `."
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the opening sequence of storming the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and gives, the sense of Verwirrtheit and unpredictability, once that happens, if somewhere history.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong movie stab at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much in too many places to act
The director also had to deal with that history is actually not many in the cinematographic sense offers exciting scenes.
He has worked with the few but it quite successful, and sometimes a bit of reality nachhilft, which then not always seems so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran by a telephone call in America is avoided, or persecution hunt on the runway, something curious).
The weakness of Argo is too broad distribution, which is due to the need, too much in too many places to act to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in their roles as Hollywood staff are very charming, but more room deserve their characters in the film, and they are far from alone.
Afflecks film loses a little traction as a result. It is a film you with some interest and the design and the Retro reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years-style can approve.
Enthusiasm, it is difficult.
As a reminder of a living piece of history and to date in certain ways as proof of how excessive but notions of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services, but it is enough.
