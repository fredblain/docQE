Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: The test should be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to greater hesitation the already undecided men for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists.
In the studies in the United States were many disturbances between the onset, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the death of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that the likelihood of education in a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of metastases is 30 to 40% higher, if not carried out early detection.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, which was ill with prostate cancer.
In men afro-American origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, has been recognized as a cancer.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient, the extent of the risk of cancer actually made clear by him the possible options, which can Prostatakrebse remain untouched, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, where it has realized that no cancer treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
The proposal offers them an active surveillance and them in advance of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy the criteria for determining a decide who should be dealt with and who does not.
Therefore, I recommend the implementation of the tests.
However, the most important thing is to speak with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for Urologie Movember has developed a device with which it is possible, the pros and cons of the PSA tests to assess.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise by at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, the spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain unresolved.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It damages strong people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society promote overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease.
They seem the risk of breast, Grimmdarm -, darm, esophageal, stomach speichel drüsen and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity throughout the life against Grimmdarmkrebs," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities it increased the risk of a Grimm or fattening darm cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by Räuchern, dry or salts could lead to the creation of carcinogens.
"the latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, but are not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
During a study to reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, another rather showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer was also not yet shown.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu, underlines how important it is, with his doctor to talk about his concerns and his family down.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
