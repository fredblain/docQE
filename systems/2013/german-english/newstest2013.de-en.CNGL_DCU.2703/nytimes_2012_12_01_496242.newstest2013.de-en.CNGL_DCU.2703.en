In a constantly elektrisierten world it is nice to be bored as well
This Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts on boredom.
I will not lie.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite nervtötend-even if books, magazines and iPhones (available) and, of course, tax-free shopping.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
If it is up to them, it is for us and our children-OK, sometimes to be bored.
This is the brain forced to lose in interesting line of reasoning, which may promotes creativity.
And because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, are the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no..
I come back.
How many people I am also always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
"The boredom actually has a very long history," he says.
The House panels Pompejis ziert a Latin inscriptions on boredom that dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long reading research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom, experience as "a satisfactory to activity, but it cannot be able to define."
Boredom differs from apathy so that the person is not employed, but would like to be.
In the case of the apathy, there is no rush to do something.
The key experience boredom, he says, in a "disruption of attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
Boredom is almost as well as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions in the problem could be linked, bored people around them or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that is dull, even if we just have difficulties to focus.
In their study "The Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention" - German around: "The untätige minds: The definition of boredom from the point of view of attention," which in September in the journal "Perspectives on psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues" to an earlier experiment, in which participants a band listen a person to read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud TV from neighboring area, which had nothing to do with the content. Other heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard this noise at all.
Those who barely recognisable television, heard said, to feel more boring than the other two groups - they have had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this, and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you a monotonous work, "as the search for faulty products on a factory förderband, music can help us and not to feel bored."
Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom can fight, even by people remain physically more closely.
"studies have shown that children who keep herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to stillsitzen," Professor Fenske.
We will all eventually boring-my late flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly ermüdender film.
But some people bore more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "range in the 1980s to Langeweileanfälligkeit."
On the Richter scale statements such as `many things I have to do, and monotonous "and" I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
Using the scale, researchers found that boys are more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida, particularly the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli.
But generally, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter bunch.
In 1991, communities and Reed Larson, a professor of human development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven or eight times a day with a Pager kontaktierte.
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and do the homework were bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents to feel bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increase or decrease.
However, he was sure that "the youth is seen as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because people in extreme cases it leads to extreme physical risks and gambling or drug addicted to alleviate it, which studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"with the boredom will the brain a say that we should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not always know what it is best to do.
If a is dull and the energy used to play Gitarre and cook, will be happy.
But television can provide for feelings of happiness in the short term, these verflüchtigen but in the long term.
So who his gelangweilten child an iPad, it can distract you from the boredom. However, it has not learned to maintain itself or control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-regulation is conveyed by a situation on the other."
The child learns not only to have more self-control, but also in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not to take a critical view them.
Instead, our objective should be to give us away from the constant activity - and technology berieselung wohlzufühlen.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth only trying to find a way to shut down and relax.
"in an environment in which we are constantly being überstimuliert, it is difficult to deal with, once the noise is silent."
