"PSG is not the Barcelona!"
In this season with PSG, you have taken on a new dimension.
How do you explain this progress?
You can by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG explain.
Great players came.
Every day I am progress on their side.
The technical staff gave me too much.
These elements encouraged me to improve my level of play on a daily basis.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football everything is very quickly.
But I breche not in enthusiasm.
Since my beginning at the heart of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine to my game time in Saint Etienne I have always made gradual progress.
They are so as to take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers are used to this summer Games very high levels.
They also know that any training unit is crucial.
The result is that a player like me who must confront and wants to give his best.
It gives me Carlo Ancelotti much in terms of my game position.
He is supported by fellow coaches as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect for all technicians.
There are currently no comparable in the Ligue 1 person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a rich experience and won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I have just recovered from a series of violation.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services.
What are your thoughts on the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of top-level reiters Lyon us.
But we lurk in the ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: We have qualified for the final 8 in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as much as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
We are, however, opposed to very good European teams have our say.
First of all, we want to be first in our group Porto so that we can fight the return leg of Achtelfinales as a home game.
The PSG can be a great European club in the short term?
He has already the budget...
In order to be a major European club, must win Paris title and make a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG the resources to enable this project is taking shape.
It would be a big failure, not winning the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really close to our hearts, cream off this title.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough for the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed with 79 points.
Normally we should be with 79 points championship...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title rings, I believe that we have the stuff on him to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4 - 0, and it still is something that we can be accused of, this is certainly something frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never every weekend with 4 - 0 win.
We are not the Barcelona.
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
In the course of time building a team.
We have shown strength in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, an association of the last two seasons fails to qualify for the final 8, and also has made huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed you break the game with 15 points ahead.
This means that our opponents and the French championship would ignored.
Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new PSG `geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems entirely by the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better that we talk of a "Zlatan dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic is strong and many goals.
That is why he and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the players and the person.
It also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, is one of the best defenders in the world, it can also all others to make progress.
How did you Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was close to my heart, to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented from some game time.
I saw things, from which I am stronger.
Today I manage to achieve good Games in the national team.
This was my hope since being launched with the `Bleus' .
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and now we must display an exemplary behavior.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the `Bleus' ?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the group qualification for the World Cup.
The coaches is strictly, the players and stimulating victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to comparison.
Blanc had achieved its objective by agreeing to qualify for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps the `Bleus' will lead to Brazil.
In Spain, on 16 October forced draw (1) a prelude game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
