The start of the course, which studied the "end of the world,"
Every week, the students apocalyptic examining issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Each semester, if the religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: "the end of the long Rückwärtszählung" of the Mayan calendar on 21 December, of which many people believed that this means the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what should await him in the following two months: The destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon' , as well as a growing conflict between Israel's participation, the place where the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester that ever existed," Charmé said this week the students at Rutgers University, Camden (New Jersey).
If someone, analyzed what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, it would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And it is not the only professor who this semester, which is supposed to be the last in the history, offers courses on the "end of the world."
In Temple, the beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, the students apocalyptic examining issues such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear materials into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and studied how they compare compared with real life.
"I have tried to inform the students, which is possible, probably, credible and it is impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a beisitzende professor of art history and anthropology formed a team to settle a course with the name "The End of the World" offer.
"We are not in 2012, so that we always keep the option, newly able to hold back on an even keel, in the event that the world does not sink," said Restall.
Despite the "impending doom" must prepare the students study projects and participate in audits.
At Penn State, the audit carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, why the students have no other option than to continue "until the night when the world comes to an end," said Restall said.
Prices were very popular.
"in two hours" Restall said there was no seats on its course for students with high average, with 35 students filled.
For weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mails from students who asked whether still places are available.
For its part, the students say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is exciting to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects-or religion mentality is really just a question of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa of psychology and health care, all apocalyptic films I have ever seen.
"I have never heard of a teaching, where it will be informed," he admitted.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed, and even less a professor, to believe in the last date of December 21.
"our first project looked at the prophecy of the Maya, and in certain ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya said never ahead of the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He, however, notes that in the western society is an apocalyptic fear that several centuries back, when the people to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world responded.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"elsewhere, people do not think so," he says.
This is particularly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, which this year in the Philippines, quickly respond to the question of whether he is a course on the "end of the world would know."
"The Philippines are not at the end of the world," he wrote on an exception to suggest a higher court.
We have a pardon by the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days last court, and said that if nothing happens, on 21 December "immediately to a new date" or are thinking about philosophierten that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period that would be the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date easily.
To celebrate several said that they wish to go on "the end of the world."
"Perhaps I call on a few friends so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year student for communications.
