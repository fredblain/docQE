One in four American young people sitting behind the coffers of Mc Donald's
In recent days there has been across the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests will continue to grow or whether they will soon be back to the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-leaning non-governmental organizations.
In addition to improving the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, the sales in the United States, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes led to Handgemengen.
On this day, some Walmart workers, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and bestreikten along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, are aimed at low and middle-income people.
Walmart sold all products, ranging from nappies of hunting rifles and car batteries to dust saugern, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore buy many of the slightly paid Walmart work only on their jobs.
Prices and the range of goods, Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say the goods often Walmart can only sell so cheaply because the staff are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about hard work conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner.
The participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanding wage increases, and expressed their irritation that the contribution to the betriebseigene health insurance has risen from 30% to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart workers who earns $9.5 per hour, cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California Berkeley show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost 3.2 billion dollars Walmart.
The equivalent of 1.1% more than they now pay for donations.
Walmart would pass on the full wage increases to their customers, each purchase only 46 cents more in the future.
Per year would be the for them compared with the current expenditure of only 12 39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine states to protests and that the company gave no losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and Walmart sold in this period some 5,000 Article per second.
Overall, the Walmart cash on "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart workers working niederlegten and the protest action only "another PR stunt" was the union that organised the protests,.
"free money!"
The protests this week in New York, where their goal but not Walmart stores (which in this progressive city unwanted and therefore are not so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants were.
McDonald's says the company sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted you no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.

At present, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollars an hour.
In fast-food restaurants will gradually increase the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8 $90 per hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to live in New York with so little money is beyond me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's was behind the Theke, but young people were living with their parents.
Hardly anyone was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with staff of McDonald's constantly people who complain that they live with this wage and sometimes have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal, the author points out, it would be irresponsible to have children if it did not know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants received a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which represents more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They further demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law does not permit this objective to stand in the way of corporate governance and trade unionists abzumahnen or released.
On the other hand, they cannot simply corporate governance.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but also for objective reasons difficult.
The main reason is the high turnover.
Unhappy
Vocal protests on this day, there were many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The height of the protests was an assembly at midday before the McDonald's on Times Square, where some local Democrats languages, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted you no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food staff together so that they paid a fair and economic prosperity can achieve that every New York deserves."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest project of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
But only a few hundred people on the ground, were far from all of them in the fast-food industry employed in the tens of thousands of work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole mass.
