In Colorado, there is no clear guidance for the new Marihuanagesetz
Of the 19 years of community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in the southeast Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: The possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a tune with which he this rauchte.
According to Orozco, he and some friends in a Septembertag with the car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, was summoned Orozco for possession of drugs and drug supplies-Kavaliersdelikte, each labeled with a penalty of $100 - and received a court hearing.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco.
But it is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalise small amounts of marijuana to find the answer in hundreds of smaller drug offences less depends on the law, as the site.
Hundreds of order widrigkeiten that revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures, already dropped.
The police authorities are no longer adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally permitted, once the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts, announced Marihuanadelikte to quote and people are still in court.
At the same time vote several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains, new state licensed Marihuanageschäfte at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which lies east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are perplexed at your head.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have been given a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that Colorado in any case is further ahead than most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. The drug was only there for medical purposes, and then Eigenkonsum legalised.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well in orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Supervisory Authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, known as I - 502, enters into force on 6 December and is also a gray area in the bottom of the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalised.
And unpleasant practice issues must be resolved in this period - for example, as the government imposition of "reasonable access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres in schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.
"location anywhere, it will be difficult for a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group.
On 21 November Chief Oates his staff in Aurora sent an e-mail in which he said that the public prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller Marihuanadelikte among people over 21 years, and that the police "immediately" will not seek Strafanzeigen for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban plans for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana will prevail and drug traffickers would continue to be monitored.
In Weld County in northern Colorado district prosecutor Ken buck a stricter view.
After the vote he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly in order to encourage consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana trial, although many have been indicted for other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to pursue violations, which are the Tatzeitpunkt was crimes," buck said in a statement.
The reactions, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the country club, shows no longer adults for the possession of small quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also chose not to drop all outstanding possession procedures.
"I do not believe that I verschwende my time, the law until it is changing," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado, supported the measure was clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana in line with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state, local officials released a profound dilemma when it comes to the big green experiment.
In district prosecutors if it were a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, representing the defendants on trial for Marihuanadelikte and on the ground as the spokesman for the national organization for reform of Marihuanagesetzen.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives, to prosecute people for that they still cannot accept the legalization," he believes.
The first states that smaller quantities of marijuana, alcohol, Colorado and Washington and national test-cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they also nervously await instructions from the federal government, the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
Advocates of legalization movement will succumb to hope that the Ministry of Justice.
Despite several aufsehenerregender arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states largely.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that law enforcement officials are unlikely to enter doors, in order to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but who are likely to resist the legal under the new legislation, state regulated marijuana to tolerate business.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities act.
Before the election day approved some local municipalities moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although this could open for at least a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, it probably will be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license and then someone at the federal level are facing a major problem," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change in the law.
Later, we opted for what the community and not according to what the state has decided.
There are still many questions unanswered.
