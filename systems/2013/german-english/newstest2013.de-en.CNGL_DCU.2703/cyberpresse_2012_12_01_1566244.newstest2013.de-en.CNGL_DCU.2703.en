The Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bosons has a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason.
It is indeed believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the bulk of all objects in the universe.
And it is the last particle whose existence by the Standard Model-our best or `least wrong "statement of nature and the behavior of the matter, but not yet been observed empirically predicted.
But it is not yet fully for physicists sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs Boson strongly resembles.
Moreover, confirmed by new data seems to be in this week in a large physics presented Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data, in order to be completely safe.
Nevertheless, we assume that it is indeed the Higgs, as seemingly little risk to deceive, and we are looking at what is at stake.
There is an inevitable in this world inescapable law, which means that two objects cannot be in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try it not too much, because you will hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that they also such a law, the Pauli Clausewitzian Ausschlussprinzip, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "Quantenzustand" and the "state" broadly consists of some of their properties.
With this in mind, physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are described as Fermione and approved the principle of Pauli.
And in the other, the Bosonen, a nasty gang of anarchists, which nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that they are indeed can pass in the same place at the same time.
This divide Bosonen The Particle Adventure, according to the website of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: The Mesonen that we are not treat and the "Kraftteilchen," spread by the large forces of nature and the Higgs Boson somehow would be used.
But it must be stressed that this Bosonen not all are so exotic creatures, as one might think.
If you are in a position to read these chronicle, it is thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The Photon or the "Lichtteilchen," the "messenger" the electromagnetic force.
If the particles with a speed up electric cargo or change the direction, the electromagnetic field on this very spot, "disrupted" as a pebble, which has been thrown into a pond.
Created by this "disturbance" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared-or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon and thus one of the Bosonen "bearer of force."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disrupted" so that this Boson shows.
However, the Higgs field much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus must reach very high energy, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be.
That is why we need a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is true that they are not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do not do so, but others - for example, a piece of paper would never think of themselves in the refrigerator.
And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those that do have a mass, while others (like the Photon) have no mass.
What all this research can now be "good," says Mrs Plamondon?
For science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists, all differences between the observations and predictions to look closely at the SM.
There are, in fact, many physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations as the slightest difference open a door to a "new physics" and could plug some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings, because there was no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, approximately 80% of the matter in the universe (ups again!).
Nevertheless, the CERN such deviations until now have not been found.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell laboratories not suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself the first permanent, laser (were the first gepulst) - said that the laser at the beginning rather was regarded as a "playing" laboratory.
Imagine...
Applications can also result from all the instruments, surrounding the research.
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the optics a small light sensor developed.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras in the world today serves as a "eye" and has won him the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
