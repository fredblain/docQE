Many people in the south of Azerbaijan achieve a biblisch high age.
There is even a Museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97 is still relatively young.

A search for traces in the country where 97 is still relatively young.
The journey by the Talysch mountains is wildromantisch.
The Kleinbus rumpelt on the curves of roads, past densely forested hills, reißenden rivers and simple farmers.
Everything is green and will mount, one could be forgiven for thinking that it is in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of the border with Azerbaijan, Iran is only a few miles away.
Here the Caucasian Talyschen segment of the population is living, not much is known, except that it speaks perfect Persian and Aserisch and is very durable.
Destination is Lerik.
The small city flaunts to wuchtig geratener architecture from Soviet times, as does not fit into the scenic mountain landscape will.
Tourists come from Europe is hardly here, too onerous the period from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours, because the road is only einspurig.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the Eurovision Song Festival famous, and next year we have here a festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the museum of longevity, the only in the world.
Here is the vita of around eight dozen Talyschen documented in the area, the more than 100 Fatulayeva shows a black and white oto.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of a child born 136 years ago
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, should have become the 168 years old.
However, there is not a birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but highly dubious.
" 1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explained Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, aged between 136 years he should have a daughter born.
Has Şirali Müslümov also in his age by a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard about the Hochbetagten in Central Asia.
"striking number hochaltrige people, there is also in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also live in Sardinia lots of very old men."
But due to a lack of documentation is no scientific proof of age, because people were register.
Every day, ashtray geschmolzene butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik striking often reach a biblisches age.
There are currently 20 people who are more than 100 years old.
So why live here in the south so many hochbetagte?
The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the with the specific genes Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that the food is.
But it is the calories of Talyschen as healthy diet should be above all dairy products, meat, bread and love, many of whom drink a glass of geschmolzene butter on a daily basis, from a nutritional point of view is not just plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that young people? In Lerik Cengemiran, a tiny settlement from the city, sits Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants live in a simple wood, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground with a Butterfass they tirelessly - and herrollt.
Eight people live under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Also two young children jump around.
In the kitchen to prepare tea, the guests in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu served glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and link under her headscarf they long dunkelblonde Zöpfe revealed that her son before us proud.
I have always with milk washed my hair, so they were never from me and kept their color.
"I have never used," says Mirzayeva shampoo.
Monthly pension is for life
She has always only eat what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not once bought in a supermarket food.
Then they told by her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar" Aliyew took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is being driven by the nation's father figure, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, later took his son Ilham the helm.
After all, there is no need in Azerbaijan elderly.
230 Manat (roughly the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for a sum here, which we can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long ergrauter son right: "the elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared and are happy.
If this is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive
