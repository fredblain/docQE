On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto binde the president and the leadership of the nation.

Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon's was able to prove economically Mexico, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which in the past six years already has cost 60,000 lives.
"My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," said Pena Nieto earlier this week the US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.

In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are crucial urban in nature.
Earlier this year, the military, in order to combat drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.

If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the president receives binde, he is also a great responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of Mexican families were affected by violent crime, and the new president has promised during his tenure, particularly in order to take care of this problem.
"I hope that as president, he is so, as he was as Governor," says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
