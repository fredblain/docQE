"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is funded by the United States," he told as a reference to the political asylum in Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted.
Correa asserted that he does not regret the decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views about human rights," has fulfilled.
He added that it was "justified suspicions had been handed over to a third country that Assange and his trial would not complied with."
It also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which requires him on its territory him undergo interrogation because of alleged Sexualdelikts, while "the Swedish legislation allows it via a video conference, the had Ecuador in London on the message can be carried out."
Correa said that the danger that would undermine the health and mental state of Assange.
"since it is in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has, however, informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the head of state Ecuador.
, there is a risk that he took physical and psychological damage, because he was trapped in a narrow space and cannot conduct physical exercises outdoors.

Correa stated that the solution to the asylum that Assange in London for the month of June in Ecuador's message was granted to the granting of a Freibriefs, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the judicial authorities would be Europe's. He stressed that there had been talks with London, in order to find a solution to the captive founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with the human rights, that we do not apply in this case, however, there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the judicial authorities Europe because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, a set of procedures in various European bodies," he said.
And "if Britain morning this licence granted, I believe that this is done."
And if Sweden Mr Assange on the message Ecuador in London or on Skype verhörte, as the Swedish law allows and in other cases, the problem will be done.
Correa took the opportunity to portray himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity that bad faith and weaken the lie that freedom of expression."
"the greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who after profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense that he congratulated Ecuador no longer of such journalists "and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries," he and I think in a re-election "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision, the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur maintain at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism must remain "hard and no opportunism and should never grant verkleideten coup to be legal," because it "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."

Correa promised that if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from the political life.
Power has never interested me personally but in unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who this likely victory guaranteed, so I have this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I retreat from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had visited South Africa, planned for a routine treatment, and that would expected that he could go back to Cuba after the election campaign.
