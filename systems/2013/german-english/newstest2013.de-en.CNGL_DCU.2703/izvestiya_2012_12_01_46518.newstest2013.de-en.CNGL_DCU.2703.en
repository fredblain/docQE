"The brain is so far only moderately outsmart"
The purveyors of the enlarged becomes a reality in supporters of modern technologies recently usually seen through the lens of a special glasses.
First, Google in the summer, a working model at its annual conference in November was then known that Microsoft had a similar patents.
In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the lens for the company's scientists was only a transit station.
It fascinates the possibility, virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and to create virtual belts.
- please Beschreiben briefly, what research group.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the borders of this interaction.
So far, humanity is largely stuck in the stage, where the Pixeln on Flachbildschirmen, which sometimes.
We want 5-10 years vorausblicken and the radical changes this interaction foresee.
, for example, the Xbox-Konsole and the Kinect sensors a step forward, and today will no longer without Xbox Kinect sold, as all interested in movement control.
- What are still expected in the future?
- Although Kinect interaction on a physical level, has a great deal to the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D.
The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We are trying to change that are working on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We need to the computer world in our physical world and make them more tangible.
Yet it is necessary that not only the users, but also its surroundings.
Then we could supplement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should be rid of this bescheuerten virtual reality helmets.
- What do you think about language management?
It is popular, but it will not overvalued?
- you is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because it does not always would like to inform all others on his actions and intentions.
Any kind of interaction with computers is really good, but each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of management of objects in public places in a project in which we experimenting with short and narrow, rather than sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not from the object camera, recorded, but by a bracelet registered the movements of the bone and muscle.
It is still relatively large, but could in theory to the size of a wristwatch be reduced.
But the future belongs to all types of mixed governance, for example, Gestik and language.
- As the?
- We would you ask me, for example, you this Sprudel dose to extend?
They say it and, at the same time.
- normally I say it simply.
- O, that would be very difficult to see.
- saying that you want the user will adapt to the, which can make a machine at the time and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the next time we especially need to work on the development of new types of sensor, which will make it possible to collect responses from people.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good dissolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands you on the basis of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
There is a lack of dissolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 Megapixel at a speed of 1000 fps not bad.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
In this respect, all current technologies not good enough for us, as the designer of the algorithms more work.
It is not only the break-up along the X and Y-but also take into account along the Z axis.
Also the speed and the number of images per second are important.
The movements of people are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps, particularly for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with a regulierbaren processing delay between 1 and 100 Millisekunden, with today's commercial carriers closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much influenced the interaction of man and machine.
Just as an instrument for my work I needed, only without contact management and with more images per second.
- should not be increased the number of cameras first?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras," with one of them actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not intended to calculate the object deep.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or, as more calculations needed to strengthen the problem.
Would be nice a flexible, Kinect-similar system in which we could play with various camera slopes, in order to determine how we help the three-dimensional investigation a position.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft his glasses not public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged everyday reality in the lens has the best prospects?
- Of course it is not nice, always a Smartphone en route to keep in the hand, but I think the following: The tollste variant would be a "rotating" enlarged reality in which we have a cloud of the lens could tune in to the Smartphone,
The lens is a personal Gadget and that is its strength (private you can only see), but also its weakness, as it is an enlarged reality through the lens prevents you can work together with other virtual objects.
- Let us for a moment that the virtual Hologramme manipulation in the air not only Tony Stark is accessible from Iron Man, but also human beings.
There is a problem, to underline the Critics frequently this idea: There is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing!
The answers to your group at this point?
- In my lectures, I often talk that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of taktilen perception.
An interesting method is the use of second hand as something unusual projection document.
It takes pressure excellent true!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at the "images in the air a hand" to give firm, for example, the collision of ultrasound directed some rays in a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently still so weak, as pustete ballen someone on hand.
There are also bands for the hand Accident, affecting the nervous endungen in the fingers, it is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
I think that it should feel what it felt when it sees something?
- This is a good idea, as we have not yet tried.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, namely a man who is physically in a closed area, to believe that he was instead in an open, virtually infinite space, where we have been working on concepts with Laufbändern (other than in fitness studios), movable platforms and large bullets.
So far the brain can only moderate fall, and we still have many years of hard work.
It is precisely that which makes work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers appeal: On many issues we are only at the start.
