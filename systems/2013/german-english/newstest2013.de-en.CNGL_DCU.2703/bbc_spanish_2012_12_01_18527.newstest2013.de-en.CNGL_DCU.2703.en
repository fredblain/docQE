Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapurer people lay the blame for the fact that they have no children, career, the stress and the cost of housing and child rearing.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viralen video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a song, the local Rapper slogans such as "pushing a" Bao " (loaf) in the kiln, about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which has made the video, preserves the hope that the advert in an entertaining way, to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to meet their "national duty."
This is something only on the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The equipment we are the worst in the world, so we remarked that this is an issue that we have to look.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of Speed dating agencies evenings (rapid Flirts).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success.
Therefore we thought: Why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap to komponieren?
1.2 children
If this issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore.
Each year, they are $1,300 for political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, hochtechnologischer city state in the southeast Asia, including for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known.
According to its national population authority is the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was more than 2, which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't get the Singapurer more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director of the national population authority for marriage and family policy, says that this is the result of a "better education" and " `major career prospects.
"This has allowed the people, except to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she said.
These changes in the social realities have higher number of single and helped delay marriage and birth, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a surge in Zuwanderungen to counteract the reduction of the population to resentment in the local population.
There are websites in Singapore, where the little kaschierte xenophobia against many new immigrants is, especially against the Chinese who criticised that they keep wages low and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem of higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers to correct.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the repercussions on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are being built.
It has already impact on the housing market.
The urban development authority has begun to control the number of small Appartements, are known as the "shoe boxes" and must be built in certain areas of the city.
These Appartements have a Wohnfl√§che of 46 square meters and show a large sales success.
But the concern is that they can promote the lifestyle of a single person, and that they will deter construction companies to build large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" much faster than bigger houses sell.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
The result is that they are very much better for our cash flow.
He is, however, that the new standards developers clearer guidelines, which previously placed obstacles in the way that they too many small units within a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore, a city state.
Even if these new rules pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate could, the talks with the Singapurern, from working in the financial quarter, that they will not have a major impact.
"people are very stressed, the housing and education are expensive, so it is delayed by many people," says a young managers.
The children can get.
"it is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.
Men and women their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and education as reasons that they cannot have children.
This is why the Singapurer have the last word, when it comes to have children, because the government can still do so much.
