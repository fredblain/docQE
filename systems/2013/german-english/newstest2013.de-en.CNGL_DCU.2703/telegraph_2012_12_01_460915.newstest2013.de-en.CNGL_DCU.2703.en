Petronella Wyatt from Oxford: I was mobbed, because I am Tory
Not only university students today will be attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream, to be given a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the University, which I once thought for the world's largest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilisation-free thinking and tolerance -.
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College in the late 1980s, I had intended to study history-I had my suitcase and the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said that I would be because I had a problem with that fellow in neighbouring rooms had sex.
The author A N Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I walked away.
Yes, because I was suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because I unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been harassed for one reason only - a reason in this alleged cradle of enlightenment seemed so parochial and cruel: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher and I have been in favor of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right suffers from similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for equal rights protection in the same benefits, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) give the Corpus Christi College, they are often isolated actively, because their political views "personally attacked and declared undesirable."
They are calling for a place in the equality committee of college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Its situation has been exacerbated by a recent ausgestrahlte documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been shown, inter alia graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, in a Rolls-Royce and with silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock protzte.
In other universities say conservative students, they are as "scapegoats" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
The 20-year Luke black, Vice President of the University of Nottingham Association of conservative students, in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing Linkstendenz universities.
The people believe that we as the Bullingdon Club, without met us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant." The 19 years Stephanie Cherill, incoming president of the conservative student association of Oxford says that it has a growing opposition to students in JCR members watched the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was such a minority.
As I was incredibly timid those aged 18 in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
Last year, the university voted in favor, Margaret Thatcher, a former student, due to cuts in higher education to give no official title.
The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.
In the first week of the incoming days, in the new students to get to know each other and the Tutoren, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the Tutoren the mockery of Tory students not only duldeten, but even with joy attended it.
Political issues such as miners strike, the government's privatisation and the rejection of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the holzgetäfelten areas of Tutoriums.
In the first of these events should I French texts translated into English from the 18th century. What should come, I was not taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said Harry Pitt (now the tutor died), "please translate the first paragraph."
I,.
Pitt was a small man with a face as pie pastry and quite invidious.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they simply stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
"I propose that they take a few Französischstunden in your spare time - in other words, if you are not too preoccupied with your social activities," Pitt knurrte me.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
This evening, I sat at the College alone at the dinner, when one easy on the back tippte.
It was a Englischstudent from the second year named James, which is presented as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are friendly," he said.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, harassed.
It is bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher close, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first-year pretend to be supporters of the Labor Party.
In a local Pub later I tried to make me.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs Thatcher was in all respects.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A first-year philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, the conservative current visited Eton College, said to me: `You are the daughter of a fascist schweins."
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dreckig.
"How Tories have sex?" asked me one.
The are each other, or?
I felt as homosexuals before the liberal legislation had to have felt the United States.
I would ever be able to Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would Gleichgesinnte can make only after dark?
I should address the Labor Party and my natural inclination to suppress?
The three years before me, from my intellectual eye gradually become a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who has admitted openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he Thatcher when it comes to foreign policy advice and wrote speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place was him provincial and narrow and turned him for his Marxist deterministische Geschichtsperspektive.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel between Oxford and the House my parents and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed in disbelief.
During his time in the Vierzigern all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
Something they would never do, not in my city of träumenden Tower.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners.
His wet eyes trübten.
Give it a chance.
I am sure that we neckt you only.
It would break my heart if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London my emotional resistance was weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had buckled under pressure and renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, where another Geschichtstutor seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly in shame zerging, I am my parents were subjected to a "brainwashing" and called them "old stupid."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, the final nail in the coffin my Oxford-career.
At the time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hidden in my room, and after five minutes, my Häscher.
When they did, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Can you give me a to weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But not those aged 18 in an educational institution should ever have to suffer such intimidation and spite.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only 14 Tory Prime Minister produced, but up to now hiding behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
