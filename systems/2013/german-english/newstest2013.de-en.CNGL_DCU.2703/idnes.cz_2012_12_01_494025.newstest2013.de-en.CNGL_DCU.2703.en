Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency ESA as the twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member country from the former communist bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA Member).
Poland began in 1994 close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects.
The path Poland into space but began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space, but they do not always were met with understanding.
I recall, for example, of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, where the author ideas from his pioneering "entrance to Kosmonautik" presented.
The ideas of the young engineer (conduct. However, 1905), the audience cold, and after years remembered Šternfeld still that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in the year in 1934 for "receipt to Kosmonautik' the donated by Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix REP-Hirsch.
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis internationally recognized contribution to the development of space, inter alia, acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon has been named after him.
As early as the year 1925 a rail Draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket powered was planned.
The author of the proposal and the details of this project, remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile for Starten or brakes the Draisine should be used.
The information derived only from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with raketenbetriebenen munitions.
The research led the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents provided that research has got to the stage of practical tests.
But the research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German military power.
In 1937 appeared in the press of mine. Draft originating Rohoziński fotoelektrischen hunting rocket, and the following year, the work "Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of missiles antriebs.
Shortly before the war were all projects for military use of missile technology by the artist scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet coordinated Doradczo Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of hard work, however, the war began his work was closed.
Other articles appeared to space after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention this society is in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which four dedicated extensive article of the space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space society.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future space exploration.
Already in its inception in 1956, the Polish space society PTA to join the International Federation for space, founded in 1951 and the PTA was actually due as early as the autumn 1956 member.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.
This office he had until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA instrumental in the development of the very successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM 1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres long and weighed approximately 80 cm was not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM, 1A, built in 1959, and began in the Błędów desert air tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM - 2
The missile was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be in a position to make real scientific work - the missile RM - 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the monitoring of high winds.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
Heir to the first rockets of the type RM was the 1962 to 1965 developed over the years Meteor 1 rocket.
The missile was conceived as a Zweistufenrakete, their total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
By this missile were developed three types (Meteor 1A, 1B - and 1 C) that in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor - 1A missile had a transport area with 0.4 litres capacity, meteor - 1B more than 34 litre and Meteor 1C on 0.62 litre.
The maximum altitude for all three types 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 was in the aviation institute the Meteor 2 missile, developed the first test flights began in October 1970.
Meteor - 2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able, specifically a of 10 kg in a level of approximately 60 km.
Then the versions were built meteor - 2H and Meteor - 3.
Is also noteworthy Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, the two years later was followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland also participated in the framework of the Interkosmos program with Soviet satellite in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski second after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut.
