In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marihuana law
The 19-year-old Community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court which will be soon legal in this state: The possession of some marihuana lumps and a whistle with which he smoked this.
According to Orozco he and some friends were on the move on one September day by the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer marihuana had found in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug utensils - the gentleman's offences which are provided in each case with a punishment of 100 US dollars - and received a court appointment.
"We are treated like criminals", according to Orozco.
However, is he also one?
During the uncertain weeks according to the decision of the state to legalise tiny amounts of marihuana to the own use the answer hangs with hundreds of smaller drug offences of less of the law, than from the location.
Hundreds of the breaches of the law which turn on marihuana, are already dropped here and in Washington which approved similar measures.
The police authorities pursue adults more than 21 years no longer for possession in small measure. This is permitted legally, as soon as the new laws come into force during the next weeks.
But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced to follow up existing marihuana offences and still cite people in court.
At the same time several towns vote, from the suburbs of Denver up to the western Mountains to hinder new, state licensed marihuana shops in the opening in her municipalities.
"This situation develops so fast that I do not know at all what will happen as a next one", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora which lies to the east of Denver.
And also regulation authorities in the federal state Washington scratch helplessly in the head.
They wait for a guidance to the equipment of a licence system of the production, production, the distribution and the sales of the drug - and, besides, have a term up to the 1st of December, 2013 before eyes.
In Washington one takes the view that Colorado is in every case to most states ahead what concerns the regulation by marihuana. There the drug was legalised only for medical purposes and then to the own consumption.
"Colorado has a stronger adjusted market. Hence, the state is well suited to the orientation", says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the supervisory authority for spirits in Washington.
But Smith also admits that no more place or system can act, than to serve for the purposes of a coarse guide.
"We have no real precedence which we can follow", he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on the 6th of December and forms with it also the terminator point of a grey area in which the state licence system does not exist though yet, but the possession is legalised.
And disagreeable practise questions must be cleared in this time - possibly as the state default of an "adequate access" to licensed marihuana should be agreed with the ban of cannabis shops in the vicinity of 300 metres around schools, parks, to playgrounds and care of children facilities.
"It will nowhere be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in cities, in particular in the conurbation of Seattle", Ben Livingston, speaker for the "centre for Legally means cannabis", a recently educated research group.
On the 21st of November Chief Oates sent to his employees in Aurora e-mail in which he explained, the public prosecutor would pursue smaller marihuana offences with people more than 21 years no longer, and that the police will aim "from now on" at no charges for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police will put through furthermore urban default to the regulation of peasants of medical marihuana and drug dealer furthermore would be pursued.
In Weld county in the north of Colorado district public prosecutor Ken Buck represents a stricter opinion.
After the vote he bragged, his authority would pursue cases of marihuana possession furthermore primarily, in order to move consumers to the denial.
Topically 119 people must be summoned in court for the possession of about 50 grammes or less marihuana, although many were also accused for other offences.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue offence by which it concerned at the action time criminal offences", Buck let in an explanation announce.
The reactions are even at places like the rural Mesa a county where voters rejected the marihuana initiative, conflicting.
The police in Grand Junction, the biggest town of the administrative district, indicates adults for the possession tiny amounts no longer.
District public prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, however, resolved also to drop not all back possession procedures.
"I do not think that I waste my time to put through the right, until it changes", he says.
Although 55% of the voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear right from the start that it would not be easy to agree on the personal consumption of marihuana with the complexities of government and judicial system.
And the contradictory reactions in the whole state promoted a radical conflict in view of the big green experiment by days among local officials.
With district public prosecutors it concerns a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents in court standing defendants for marihuana offences and operates on site as a speaker for the national organisation to the reform of marihuana laws.
"You have spent a so large part of her life to pursue people for the fact criminal that they cannot accept the legalisation yet", he thinks.
When the first states which treat tiny amounts of marihuana like alcohol are traded Colorado and Washington as national pattern cases for the legalisation by drugs.
During advocates and civil servants to themselves for an age of legal sales prepare, they wait at the same time also nervously on instructions of the Federal Government which wants to treat the sales and the cultivation of marihuana at the national level furthermore as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give way.
In spite of several sensational arrests of consumers and shop assistants of medical marihuana the Federal Government has permitted the sales of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to the large part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug politics adviser of the Obama's government takes the view that detectives will stamp though probably in no doors to confiscate tiny amounts of the drugs, however, will presumably struggle to tolerate the by the state adjusted marihuana shops legal under the new legislation.
Several towns in Colorado do not wait only at all for the fact that the federal authorities act.
Still before the election day some local local governments approved moratoria for new marihuana shops, although these could open only in about one year.
The last week Montrose, a town decided in the west, a 6-month ban which is presumably dismissed the next week.
"We would not like to get in a position with which we licence somebody and stand then at the national level before a big problem", according to Bob Nicholson, member of the town council.
Our municipality has been right against this law change.
We are directed afterwards on what the municipality has decided and has not decided afterwards, on what the state.
Many questions are still open.
