Then the presidential office of Peru sent e-mail with the "final explanation" of the summit to the media and it concerned, however, the explanation of Humala and not around the official document for the end of the summit.
In the last October Peru was a host of the III summit South America - Arabian states (ASPA), and also with this opportunity the so-called explanation of Lima which one had announced before was just as little published in spite of emphatic request by the press.
On the official web page of the ASPA one can convince himself of the fact that the document was published on the last Tuesday.

The summit also ended with the common obligation of Chile and Peru to suppose a judgment of the court of law of Hague which adds a border conflict between both countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they accepted the decision of the IGH which begins on Monday in Hague, in the process which Lima initiated against Santiago to listen to the pleadings of both sides.
"We will obey the judgment about the differences which we bring forward presently to this international court of law and explain", said Humala together with his Chilean opponent.
"Chile was, is and also remains furthermore a country which keeps to the international laws, peaceful solutions for disputes searches, agreement closes and submits to the international courts of law", adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.

"Possibly I will meet on the tomorrow's day (Saturday) president Daniel Ortega", said Santos.
"We will check all these ways - they are not excluding, and also talks with Nicaragua make the agreement with Nicaragua necessary", he underlined.
"I hope to the president Ortega to be able to say that we this matter civilises so and deferentially as possible will treat", Santos added.
