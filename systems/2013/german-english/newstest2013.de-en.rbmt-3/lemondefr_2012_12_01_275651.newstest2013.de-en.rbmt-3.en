"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have accepted with PSG a new magnitude.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain him by a personal examination, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Wonderful players have come.
Daily I make on her side progress.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements urge me every single day to improve my play level.
And with a play this is even easier.
In the football everything goes very fast.
But I do not break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory education of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time with Saint-Etienne I have made always gradual progress.
They make use therefore of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new entries of this summer are accustomed to deliver plays to very high levels.
They also know that every training unity is decisive.
This leads to the fact, that a player like I who must offer forehead and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot concerning my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele who played on the same position like me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti gives respect to all engineers.
In the Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he counts to the best trainers of Europe.
He looks back at a rich experience and has won many titles with respectable associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think that he wins other titles in Paris.
In January I have carried on a reassuring conversation with him.
At that time I had recovered just from an injury series.
The trust which he has put in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyons has taken to us a seat of the front runner.
However, we lurk in the ambush.
One of our most important aims is the Champions League: we have qualified in this manner for the round of the last sixteen.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to come so far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
Indeed, we will have to have a say against very good European teams our word.
First we want to become a first of our group before postage, so that we can deliver the moving game of the round of the last sixteen as a home match.
Can a big European association become of the PSG in the short period?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a big European association, Paris Titel must win and make to himself in the long term a name.
Today this is not the case.
Financially gives itself of the PSG the means, so that this plan accepts concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1, how was this the case in the last season?
This one big disappointment would be natural.
This year it really lies to us in the heart to skim this title.
In the last season we were thick in it.
In May we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to carry off the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong achievement.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Ordinarily one should be with 79 points Master...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved a still better season.
I think that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams struggle like Marseille, Lyons or Bordeaux for the title, I think that we have the makings of winning him.
Do you think that the media too much expect from the PSG?
In consideration of that what has been invested and the players whom we have it is normal that a lot is expected from us.
We accept this completely.
If we win, however, with a home match against Troyes 4-0, and one still finds something of what one can accuse us, is a little bit frustrating with certainty.
One asks himself what the people still expect.
We could never win any week-end with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to put up a play draught.
A team is based with the time.
In the Champions League we have proved strength.
Look at Manchester city, an association since two seasons does not get to qualify for the round of the last sixteen, and the also gigantic issues has effected!
In view of the invested sums one believed you to the play break with 15 points projection!
This would be called that our opponents and the French mastery would be disregarded.
Lyons and Marseille which were not good in the last season became from this new PSG "geboostet".
This shows that the Ligue 1 are exciting.
I hope that we will be the smiling winner in the May and say ourselves that we have won them in spite of all difficulties, finally.
The PSG seems to be dependent completely on the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependence".
That is the fact that Ibrahimovic is highly competitive and scores many goals.
Therefore, he has come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere where he has played, he has made clear that he is a wonderful player and a world star.
Within the team we respect the player as well as the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has performed, is really unusual.
This urges the other to improve her play level.
Thiago Silva who is worldwide one of the best defenders also allows it to all other to make progress.
How have you experienced the EM 2012 with the French national team?
How a disappointment.
It lay to me in the heart to take part in these EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has stopped me from knocking out some playing time.
I have seen there things from which I have arisen strengthened.
Today I succeed in realising good plays in the national team.
This was since my baptism with the "blue" my hope.
From that what has occurred in the Ukraine we have pulled our apprenticeship, and today we must display an exemplary behaviour.
Which opinion do you have by the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "blue"?
He has reached promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the world championship.
The national trainer is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to the victory.
How it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to draw no comparison.
Blanc had achieved his aim, while he had qualified us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue" to Brazil.
Does the draw enforced on the 16th of October in Spain (1:1) show a prelude play?
This play has given us confidence.
Everybody has exerted itself for all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain I have never experienced a comparable play in my career.
