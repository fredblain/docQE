The film Argo: If it stands worst, Hollywood call
In November, 1979 a mob of demonstrating Islamic students took the US-American message in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release they demanded the delivery of the overthrown shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who had fled after the revolution in the USA which had protected the patronage about his regime for decades.
For the American government there was from this situation no positive way out - she could not afford to abandon the shah, because this would have damaged the trust of her allies in other countries massively.
At the same time she was not able, in Iran where the revolution flowed into the installation of a theokratischen regime to put through the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow for the call of the united states, and the next fiasco with the forcible attempt of the hostage's freeing made everything only bad.
The arrested diplomats were released, finally, after 444 days, after negotiations had been provided by the Algerian government.
The destiny of the hostages caused at home a wave of the solidarity as well as anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran considerably contributed to the defeat Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan with the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history which gave a small part victory to the USA.
Immediately before the occupation of the message six message employees managed the escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities in bringing the refugees from Iran; an extravagant story helped to them in it to the cover of her true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports in disguise as members of a film stick which visited locations for a science fiction film supposedly in the country.
Combination of the genres
From the expert for "ex-filtration", Tony Mendez, plan developed the cooperation of Hollywood also required.
So that the camouflage became plausible, articles about this film project appeared in technical periodicals, press conferences were held, and the fictive production society had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret long. The film rests on the recollections of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand it is a realistic political thriller, at the same time, however, also one so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the history of a successful exploit as for example the film Ocean's Student.
The mood levels thereby alternate in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the title sequence are shown ikonische contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other side the loose passages from Hollywood, ironically and easily exaggerates come along.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits in the conference table, on the office halls, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed with this film a noteworthy new start of his career.
From a smiled actor a respectable director has become, and also now as an actor it is not any more the aim of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature after the crime film no child's play (Gone baby Gone, in 2007) and the thriller town mercilessly (2010).
At the same time it is Afflecks the first film which does not play in home Boston of the director.
Besides, the feel for the atmosphere of the place belonged to the signs which removed the previous films of this director of the standard of Hollywood.
Affleck proves this feel, nevertheless, also in Argo where Teheran of Canada is "played".
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events which have really taken place - the input sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in her clarity, and, besides, provides still the feeling of the confusion and the Unvorhersehbarkeit, this enters if somewhere once the history moves.
A similar effect achieves Affleck with his team also with fictive scenes (the wrong film stick on a bazaar in Teheran).
Too much action at too many places
The director also had to argue with the fact that the history offers not really many scenes stretching in the cinematic sense.
However, with few he works rather successfully and he helps the reality sometimes something - what looks so elegant then not always (the scenes in which the menacing crisis on the airport is turned away in Teheran by a telephone call in America, or also the pursuit hunt on the start road, look a little bit unnatural).
The weakness of Argo is his much too wide dispersion which is caused by the need to have to point too much in action at too many places.
Though Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very winning in her roles as a Hollywood employee, however, her figures would have earned more space, and with it they stand in the film by far not only.
Afflecks film thereby loses something to tractive power. It is a film which one can pursue with certain interest and appreciate, besides, the creation and to a thriller from the 70th years reminding retro style.
He wakes up enthusiasm, nevertheless, only hard.
As a recollection of a piece living till this day in certain manner of history and as a proof of that, as coatedly, nevertheless, the images of the omnipotent and omniscient Secret Services are, nevertheless, he is enough.
