"South America must learn by the integration of the citizens", says Rafael Correa
Today the president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an aim and "South America can really learn somewhat of Europe."
Correa which took part in the 6th summit of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) which took place in Lima explained to the state television in Peru that the Europeans killed themselves "during the second world war and in other discussions" and "today practically a native country are."
In this sense he defended the project to create a South American citizenship which the member's states of the Unasur speed up.
"The free circulation of the citizens and workers must be reached in all South American countries as this is the case already in the Andes community; however, there are still reactionary sectors which aim at a return in the past", warned he.
Moreover, the president of Ecuador recommended the reorganisation of the organisation of American states (OEA) under the default to reduce the influence of the anglo-saxon states and to consider that which have signed the agreement of San José about human rights.
Which teach never commit themselves to something, and as a countermove in addition we sign the South Americans always everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the interamerican commission has her seat in Washington for human rights and is financed from the United States", he explained as an allusion on the political asylum which has granted Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision because he has betrayed with it not his principles, but to his "deep democratic values and views about human rights" has followed.
He added that there has been at that time "reasonable supposition that Assange would be delivered to a third country and his procedure would not be kept."
Moreover, he criticised the Swedish justice which has required from him to submit him on his state area to a questioning because of a supposed sexual offence, while the "Swedish administration of justice permits this by means of a video conference which could have been explained about the message of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that the danger insisted that the health and the psychic state would be affected by Assange.
"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken with him, however, the ambassadress has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but nobody serious", said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there is the danger that he would take physical and psychic damage because he would be caught in a narrow space and can carry out no physical exercises outside.
"This would affect the health of every person", he added.
Correa gave that the solution was granted for the asylum, the Assange since the June in the message of Ecuador in London which is a granting of a charter with which he can travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juridical authorities of Europa's. He underlined that there have been talks with London to find a solution for the locked up founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with the human rights, we do not apply this word for this case, however, there have been constant talks.
"The solution for this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juridical authorities of Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a row of procedure on different European authorities leads", he explained.
And "if Great Britain morning grants this charter, this is finished in my opinion."
And if Sweden Mr. Assange on the message of Ecuador interrogated in London or about Skype as it admits the Swedish administration of justice and was made in other cases, the problem would be finished.
Correa used the opportunity to be confirmed as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity, the bad intention and the lie are which weaken the freedom of speech."
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the bad and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail", he said.
In this sense he congratulated himself that Ecuador is not controlled any more by such journalists "and also not from the bankers or hegemonischen and middle-class countries", and anticipated that he will deepen with a reelection "the revolution to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to his next elections and he argued that the organism "must remain hard and may grant no opportunism and nobody as a legally dressed up coup d'état" because thereby "the legitimacy of the democracy was destroyed in Paraguay."
Moreover, the president of Ecuador holds the wish of his Colombian opponent to negotiate Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the international court of law of Hague, which the maritime state Highness of Nicaragua bevorteilte, with Nicaragua the sea-juridical borders between both countries, for "absolute entitles."
Presently this judgment is not moved.
It concerns a problem between the south and a Medium American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, however, they must be overcome in the striving for a common way.
They must be treated extensively, so that one can overcome them and look forwards.
Also he trusted in a good end of the disputes about the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court of law and believed that "it is right for Latin America to call international authorities if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it precipitates very hard."
Concerning the possibility that he positions himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to reach in succession his third mandate he gave that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes difficult also very much."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February, 2013 he withdrew from the political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under so unfair circumstances like in Ecuador this socioeconomic poverty can be corrected only by the political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was it which guaranteed this likely victory, therefore, I must follow to this responsibility", he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as a president, then I withdraw from the public life.
This is also valid if we lose.
"This is decided", he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have spoken just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He has said me that he has travelled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he can travel after the electoral campaign again to Cuba.
"It means a relapse in the state of health of the president Chávez in no case", he commented.
Today the ecuadorianische head of state took part in Lima in the 6th summit of the heads of state and head of government of the union of South American nations (Unasur) which was finished with the call for a higher regional integration to provide for a lasting progress, equality and security.
