Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and ill body parts on the neutral green packets which are same for all tobacco brands
The worldwide first laws for uniform cigarettes and tobacco packaging are come into force in Australia. With it brand logos and colours are substituted with neutral, olive-green lids which are printed, in addition, with drastic pictures which ill body parts and show ill babies and children by cigarette smoke.
From the different health warnings and pictures once seen the only difference exists from the next Saturday between the packets in the trade name which are printed in identical, small writing.
With it Australia introduces the worldwide strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from the smoking, while the glamorous picture of the tobacco consumption is removed.
Besides, the government goes out from studies which have shown that the people who have not started with 26 yet smoking will not start with 99 %-iger likelyhood also afterwards any more.
"One can already see with children of young age that they understand the message, the tobacco groups with her brand picture try to promote", according to federal health minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies which have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia shows one of the slightest smoker's rates of the world and the changes will affect only slightly the profits of the multinational groups, other countries already consider similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It is said so, with the laws black market trade would be favoured what leads to cheaper and lighter accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian forgers will offer by far larger amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.
Other, however, say that the laws have started her business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family enterprise, marks that the inquiry for cigarette cases and silicone lids have terrifically risen to the cover of the intolerable packaging, since the groups of British American Tobacco, Britain's failed Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago most highly Australian court of law with her challenge of the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale firms and waits for new supplies.
For us this is a good business.
According to expert the hook lies in the popularity of social media with the exactly section of the population at which the plan is directed.
A row of Australian laws has exiled tobacco groups from the TV advertisement, has prohibited it them to appear as sports sponsors and to lay out most traders in addition constrainedly, cigarettes in shops no longer. Now the tobacco advertisement is changed on the Internet.
The Australian government has forbade Internet advertisement by local enterprises and sides, nevertheless, owns no influence on international sides.
"Who markets tobacco and has only one small area, for the rest to promote his products, does not come round round the Internet", says Becky Freeman, researcher in the health service at the university of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has ascertained an increase in progress reports to the brands which were written by "quite normal people".
One must put the question to himself: Is this only a private individual who thinks to so big fallen in Marlboro cigarettes that she takes up for it even a video - or does a marketing agency deal with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry concentrates instead of upon marketing to argue with the new laws.
She has gone even so far of paying the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest the new regulations - those countries complain at the World Trade Organisation to unfair commercial restrictions, although none of the countries pursues bigger trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for the middle of 2013.
According to Plibersek the government has carried on conversations with the other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was in 2001 the first country which prescribed photographic warnings.
Meanwhile these were expanded on more than 40 countries, under it Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not influence me.
I simply ignore them.
"One simply takes a spring and puts away the box", says Victor El Hage by the purchase of a cigarette box on which a photo with an oral tumour is printed.
To tell the truth, there is only one reason, why I would stop, and this is my small girl.
James Yu, operator of tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city centre of Sydney, says, the uniform packaging has complicated the fill-up of his shelves.
"Earlier I have used one hour to sort a delivery, now I need four", says Yu.
"The government should have forbidden cigarettes simply completely - then we would have said ourselves okay, this it was, we close", he adds obviously infuriated.
