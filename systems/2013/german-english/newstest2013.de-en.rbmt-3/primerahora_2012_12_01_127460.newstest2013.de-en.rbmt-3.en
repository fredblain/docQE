Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world stroller of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was longer to the wicker sport than 60 years linkedly and has travelled around the whole world.
A few in Puerto Rico dispose of such a big spiritual collection of the history of the basketball of the country like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to the wheel chair, Rexes was during 6 years a part of this sport, it is as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, authorised representatives and leaders in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"All my life I have put on in the basketball many hats, even several at the same time when I was a president of the BSN, general managers of the national team and president of the association in the 90s" remembered Reyes in a visit of Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated almost everybody with photos and recollections of his long career and testify them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional recollections are that which remind of his time with the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as a player till 1982 where he celebrated his 15-year-old jubilee as a comanager or manager of the club.
"This was my prime of life which I have enjoyed mostly because I part of eight masteries of the Vaqueros since 1967 am it as a manager, comanager or trainer might be.
These were many fulfilling years, including five masteries successively from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a mastery in 1981, the year of the debut to Jerome Mincy with BSN.
From then took over "Cuco" Ortiz who was a very good governor", says Reyes.
I still know that Bartow which worked here as a trainer and was done at the university of Alabama (Birmingham) said me genes: "I have very much a strong and 2-m-player.
Would you want him?"
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players whom Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow recommended afterwards the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse who can be naturalized and one of our best throwers was.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastery for Bayamon Gausse provided for an other one.
The mastery of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance because he stood in 1988 already at the uppermost place of the association.
At this time he preferred to enjoy his enforcements and from Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won for the first time in the preolympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Then the world championship came in 1990 with which we booked the fourth place what should have been, actually, a bronze if not this Canadian referee had been who allowed to repeat the last play train to us for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the world championship in 1990 the best national team whom you have ever seen?
She belongs to the best, as well as that which won with the Olympic Games in 2004 against the Dream team.
However, my favorite is the team of the panamerikanischen plays in 1991 in Cuba where we won gold and offered to the team of the USA a fight, like at that time when they won bronze against us with the world championship.
With that team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, besides, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales who could not be present in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team whom maybe concerning personalities the best was not with whom we won, however, a gold medal and which gave big pleasure to us was that of the preolympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute with the closed players because of the incidents on the Panamerikanischen to plays in Mar del Plata, we won against every forecast the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at level of the international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has as dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a row of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What believes you is the best what you have reached in the association?
I was a part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 who enclosed the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in a season.
What remains to you still to act?
There are things which I would have introduced, as for example the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The fact that the boys play in Ponce, e.g., only in her area and hit only in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children go on needlessly many trips and plays.
At least I see the result of the prescribed Ausbildungen and courses for trainers, table official and referees.
I am proud of it.
What do you make today?
I hear with pleasure music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and again I go to a basketball play.
And of course I enjoy the society of my Mrs. Isabel who was always on my side.
