Ministry of the Interior ignores unlawful weapon market
Portion of legal weapons in criminal offences extremely slightly
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans an increase of the weapon law for private weapon owners.
With it the authorities react to the latest events: Injured with gunfights on weddings as well as seven dead people with the amok run of the Muscovite lawyers Dmitri Winogradow.
The police wants to forbid carrying non-deadly weapons in public and raise the age for the possession of firearms of from 18 to 21 years.
The chairperson of the Duma committee on security and corruption fight, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised has the proposal that the changes in the weapon law are presented shortly to the Duma.
Not everybody are contented with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight against the problems by "attraction of the screws".
On the Internet an open letter was published whose authors - representative of different weapon associations - demand of the authorities to refrain from "pointless increases".
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, expressed of the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, to the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes with use of the registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a Total of 1,168 000 offences were registered.
The authors of the open letter are persuaded that an increase of the law will not keep criminals from it for private weapon owners from serving itself on the black market.
At the moment one can find according to the authors in Moscow every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spreading of unlawful weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories up to the officers
The weapons reach about several canals the black market.
There are five such main canals, tells a former colonel Viktor Baranez who acted ten years in the ministry of education and in the general staff.

The first canal is the army or the military, i.e. weapons which were stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers as well as the Caucasians themselves", says Baranez.
On the second canal there come the unlawful weapons which are stolen from representatives of the law by criminals.
Baranez explains that moreover weapons count which were stolen from the armories of the police as well as directly by employees of the criminal proceedings authorities.
Other ones illegally sold weapons come from military arms caches.
With a lot of military storage it often came to explosions.
"There are proofs that it concerned with some cases arson to cover up the absence of weapons", says the former member of the armed forces.
The weapon manufacturers also make according to Baranez a contribution to the black market.
"Nowadays there are countless private armament factories who do not stand firm of the international competition and squander, therefore, the weapons under the hand on the black market, possibly in Moscow,", reports the expert.
Another canal of the black market is the smuggling.
Particularly many guns and guns come from poor countries like Kirghizia.
"There is own, sometimes craft production as well as a mafia which organises the smuggling", explains the former member of the armed forces.
Where from do the weapons come?
Experts calculated which portion each of five canals about has in the supply of the black market with unlawful weapons.
In 2011 a report was written by the centre for problem analyses and state management.
The experts analysed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the federal service for state statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on main entrances on the subject Weapons.
The prevailing part of the unlawful weapons comes according to the investigators of the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the "guilt of persons responsible, in her work with weapons deal reached", one says in the report.
To the data of the researchers according to 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% decrease to thefts with the weapon production, and 5% come from unlawful excavations.
A sales consultant of a weapon store who does not want to be called notable assures that the weapons which are found with unlawful excavations for a long time nobody more shops, because they have become outdated.
According to him it is more frequent that traders get themselves the supplies in an arms cache.
About an officer cadet a weapon, for example, a gun is bought from the type TT.
The weapon is issued and handed over by the fence.
"The trader brings the weapon in the town and sells them there for 900 euros each with two magazines", he tells
"The police knows of course about all answer and, therefore, leads if it cannot keep to the plan to the disclosure of crime, the sales consultant adds periodically controlling purchases with the traders by who offer unlawful weapons".
"Wie im Luxusladen"
Buyers and shop assistants find most often about friends to each other.
I had had a look at web pages and Blogs when somebody became attentive to me and to me suggested to the station "Begowaja" coming where a person would wait for me who would bring me to a certain place where we could negotiate then the price.
I found out the price of the weapon only there

"To procure a weapon, I need a friend, the contacts has", tells the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I do not trust him".
There is trader at the markets, however, there one must go and arrange to meet a code like "from Iwan Iwanowitsch which allows to aim that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I come currently even to some blow rings about a friend whom I trust.
He delivers the blow rings also to me because he knows that I do not blab on him.
Novices look for weapons on different ways.
The former member of the armed forces Viktor Baranez tried middle of the 1990th weapons unlawful as a buyer when he wrote an article on this subject.
The pattern have not changed according to him.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was illustrated.
"I felt like in the luxury store", remembers the member of the armed forces.
The buyer gets according to Baranez not the cat in the bag, but can try out everything.
I as a potential customer shop not just, but go with the shop assistant in the wood, and there we put up a target.
"Then I can shoot there, and if I am persuaded of the fact that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other", the expert describes the action.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet searching machines show searching results to web pages and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There are required neither some papers nor is it personal meetings.
"You need only the suitable sum money", one means to buy fight gun or gun" in the advert on the web page ".
There users give up your orders and put inquiries.
It is also sold to persons under age?
"Of course without licence", asks user "Iwan" (literal quotation).
"To purchase a TT. Moscow", there is the laconic inquiry of "Fedorenkow".

I have belonged from the following pattern: The web page is ordinarily registered abroad, and Russian laws find no use.
The persons responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money about a cash dispenser.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon", reports the press agent of the charitable organisation "Pravo oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that one can also come away empty-handed in the end and come behind grids if one places an inquiry on a web page.
