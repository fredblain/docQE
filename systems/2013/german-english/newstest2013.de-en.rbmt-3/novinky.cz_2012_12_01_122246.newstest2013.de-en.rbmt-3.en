Directives for inflating of aerial balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com which exclaims annually a survey about the absurdest bank charges has decided this year to organise the competition "the absurdest order or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea the plan recently proposed by the EU made us introduce a women's rate of 40% in the management of big European companies", said Patrik Nacher who looks after the organisation of this survey compared with the newspaper Právo.
Under the nominated Absurditäten, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice about the standardization of the insurance rates is for men and women.
Till then women enjoyed an advantage with life insurances because they show objectively a lower risk for the insurance societies.
"Other unbelievable inspirations from the EU workshop can be nominated till the end of this year.
Then the real vote occurs till the end of February, 2013", informed Nacher.
The obliging admixture of Bioethanol belongs among other things to the controversial EU orders to fuels which is nature-damaging in her result, furthermore the ban of the reliable mercury thermometers, only because contain this one relatively small quantity of this danger material, or also the directive to the size of the chicken cages because of which this year eggs became substantially more expensive.
Criticism harvested in the past also the actual ban of the use of the concept "Butter spread" or also the sales ban on customary light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry whose demands are represented in Brussels as a rule by one or several member countries (Czechia tries currently, for example to put through the demands of Czech banks also with veto threat).
Lobby interests were behind it also that bananas of the highest commercial class must be at least 14 cm long in the EU and may show no "bend anomaly".
Besides, the European Commission defended itself with the argument that it harmonises merely the nonuniform state norms which would hinder trade.
The norms with regard to fruit and vegetables were made soft by the EU against the opposition of some countries already with the tip that the present directives would lead to a squandering of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is possibly the EU order of the last year which according to aerial balloons by the sales must be provided with the tip that children may inflate the aerial balloon not without supervision of an adult less than eight years.
Besides, the EU appealed to an American study which according to aerial balloons the leading cause are in the suffocation death of children.
A similar restriction is already valid for children till 14 years with the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are strange inspirations also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive which concerns the European officials - everybody which takes an official function in the EU, the name may not use because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece Macedonia and must say, instead, FYROM (moulder Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server nominated Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez fair beside o.g. Absurditäten also the EU order about the extent of stocks of food in the area of a member country.
The EU fixed with it the Höchstvolumen in stocks of food which might be on the day of our EU entry on the area of Czech Republic.
Then Czechia crossed, e.g., the agreed volume for mushroom canned food for which to us a high fine threatened.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for the fact that they have no sea, or, however, from the idea to give conveyor money for applications for conveyor money.
These ideas came, admittedly, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply by the EU restitution", explained in autumn, 2004 the Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas at that time (ČSSD).
As an argument he stated that the grain harvest has been very high and the state camps as a result of the so-called. Intervention shopping was overcrowded.
Because Czechia has an other way to seaports, the EU according to palace should pay hundreds of millions euros to us.
The European Commission met Czechia, finally, so far that it organised an advertising about the purchase of grain from countries which have no access to the sea.
The ministry of regional development under the direction of minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) offered conveyor money for applications for conveyor money to the municipalities, besides, specifically it should concern means for the Aufsetzung of conveyor money applications in Brussels.
The EU: Weird orders are the exception
Orders are earned in the member countries though easily to the target of the criticism, the efforts of the EU towards regulation and with it also around effectiveness and development of the whole European Union according to opinion of some experts, nevertheless, rather recognition.
A more serious problem is according to opinion of these experts rather the EU-conveyor money for projects which have in common purely nothing at all with deepening the European integration which were forced, nevertheless, at the budgetary negotiations by single member countries.
The fact causes in this country also emotions that Czechia must fight as other member countries in Brussels for the right on use of specific names of traditional products and this fight, besides, not always wins.
Though Czechia could defend after a 6-year-old fight with Germany and Austria the name "Olomoucké tvar þ ky", nevertheless, our manufacturers had to rename the native's rum (Tuzemsk ý around) whose tradition goes back with us till the 19th century as "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may be used only for products from sugarcane distillate, not for products from sugar beets.
In the official list of the products registered in the EU dip in the society of the world-famous cheese kinds Feta and gorgonzola, of the Lübeck marzipan or the Parmaschinkens now also the Karl's barber-surgeon rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Třebo ň, or also the Saazer hop on.
About an EU brand can boast there the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer roles.
