To the Gefreiten of the US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
The public prosecutor's office has tried on Friday to find out that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - accused for the biggest exposure of confidential information of the US-American history - missed several opportunities to complain to the maltreatment supposedly suffered by him in military custody.
With a cross-examination Mannings during a prejudicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden Well that documents had carried out for weekly visits, the prison official during Mannings of 9-month custody time in Quantico, Virginia no discomfort upon his treatment showed.
One day before the cross-examination which was held as a result of an application of the defence to the refusal of the accusation - Manning has been punished by the hard custody time already enough - Manning had stated, he would have considered the suicide in the prison.
To the Secret Service analyst of the US army who was arrested in June, 2010 is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents during his business hours in Iraq.
Then the material was published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a spring of the information.
In the hearing on Friday Well went through with Manning the forms which officials had filled after her meetings with Manning during his custody in the Quantico-military prison where he had served a sentence from July, 2010 to April, 2011 under reinforced prison conditions.
The officials put Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Well questioned him on Friday about the forms, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the equipment all together as "very professional".
The forms, thus Well, contained no discomfort upon maltreatment, although the employed Manning had conferred with directly about his treatment.
Manning answered, he has expressed his doubts orally and the officials would have discussed this with him and would have indicated to deal with these. Nevertheless, they have not been taken down.
"You wrote down "No problems" (after discussion of the doubts), and meant not necessarily that I said generally nothing", according to Manning.
The judge, colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning, why he did not complain to his treatment when he met in January, 2011 a committee which should examine mentioned suicide thought from him some months before on a form.
Manning answered, his intention during this meeting has consisted in letting his observation status to the "prevention of injuries" herabstufen.
The military stated, it has to him this restrictive status - which stands a step under the suicide danger - to his and the protection more different assigned.
"I wanted to persuade employee of the fact that it went well to me, and the observation status to the prevention of injuries get rid (...) around a quality of life higher from my view to be able to reach", said Manning.
Manning stated on Thursday for his arrest and transfer to Kuweit where he was held on roughly two months, before he was moved in July, 2010 in the prison of the naval base Quantico in Virginia.
He said, in Kuweit he has considered the suicide and has become unconscious on account of the heat once.
Not to be allowed to know what happens with him or in the outside world, has been incriminating.
"My world shrivelled on camp Arafjon, on this cage", said Manning on Thursday.
I thought, I would die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning has spent the large part of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
One has permitted to him only one mattress, a cover, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said, he has tried to remain in movement, because on the day it has been forbade, to sleep or even to lie down.
Always he had to sleep with the light which penetrated from the outside into his cell.
If at night he has turned round and guards could not see his face any more, one has woken him, so that he turns back himself again.
In January, 2011 Mannings lawyer raised formally objection against the treatment Mannings.
In April, 2011 Manning was moved in the military prison by fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday the judge Manning also conferred with about an accusation which he had raised in his statement on Thursday - he has one night in the nude in his cell in Quantico must sleep and stand with an early morning counting in the nude before alert and other prisoner.
Manning had stated, he has never had during this counting the opportunity to wrap up himself in his cover.
While questioning on Friday Manning bragged, he has closed for an order of his guard that he should drop the cover with which he could have covered himself. Nevertheless, he admitted that him nobody had requested to it.
On Thursday Manning had stated that he was made at the previous night sleep in the nude. He would have tried before to show to an official that he shows no danger for himself.
Manning has said the official, he could have used alliance of his underpants or his flip flops to injure himself, this, nevertheless, not done.
At this night, so Manning stated, his underpants, flip flops and glasses from his cell have been removed.
His lawyers hope that the judge at least will consider his custody experiences and drastically reduce his custody measure, he should be condemned at his negotiations before the military court. This is attached for the beginning of the next year.
The defence has given that Manning confesses of lower offences for guilty, while the other charges which are considered as too extreme should be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is attached for this week-end. A justification of the prison conditions is expected from the public prosecutor's office.
The Pentagon remains with his position that Manning was held on according to the regulations which are valid for everybody under the highest safety measures in Quantico for kept prisoners.
To the charges against Manning count the furtherance of the enemy, wrongful publication of secret service information on the Internet, the transference of national defensive information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found in all charges guilty, a lifelong prison sentence threatens him.
