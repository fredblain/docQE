Birth in the universe
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings come along aboard on the search for a spare planet.
To save the humanity, does the important question position itself as we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the spare planet?
There are not many choices in my opinion.
De facto there are only two real planets which we could inhabit at least hypothetically.
"Because Mars and Venus", says the scientific employee of the Astronomical star mountain institute Vladimir Surdin.
While, nevertheless, the conditions on Mars are relatively friendly to life, a temperature of 500 degrees rules on the surface of the Venus.
Life would be possible only by big height or in the orbit of the Venus, so in all.
The researchers treated the question of the reproduction in all first in view of the flora.
Already half a century before it experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas grown in the orbit differed not in the slightest from the earthly kinds.
The ZÃ¼chtung of insects followed, more exactly from tiny fruit aviation (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979 quail's eggs were sent in the universe to investigate how the weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops quite a normal fledgling.
However, then the problem begins.
"The problem consists in the fact that the fledgling must find hold; it must be able to stand on his legs and start moving", explains the lab leader of the institute of medical-biological problems COME ON, Vladimir Sychew.
Without firm subsoil the fledglings wildly overturned.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn children completely from.
The fledglings did not react to light and sounds.
Then four days later they simply died.
"Twice we let fledgling slip and then put the whole because it is simply impossible to work there with them", Vladimir Sychew sticks to the failed experiment with the fledglings in all.
The last brood cage with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In spring, 2013 the experiments are continued.
However, will be on the biosatellite "Bion" only same-sexual species.
There was an experiment with rats who were already sent fertilised in all.
Besides, in principle nothing was ascertained special.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but once more it was only one single experiment, and the researches must be continued", notes Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing the space rats got younger generation.
One could not solve the problems of the reproduction directly in the space up to now.
The job is difficult.
The animals who are torn from her natural living space cannot simply follow her reproductive desire.
In contrast to animals the person would be able to do this in principle.
The homo sapiens is able of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
However, women already fly for 50 years in all.
There was the biggest risk with Tereschkowa.
The most valuable which owns the humanity is the female organism.
Our gull flew away, and nobody on the earth could have answered the following question: Does she get over the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth after this flight to a child?
"Finally, nobody answered this question", says space ex-serviceman awake seaweed Watschnadse.
In June, 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, bore a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman bore in all, Swetlana Sawizkaja who was twice in the orbit and did even works beyond the spacecraft, a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have only extremely few cosmonauts with whom after long flights everything went well and they recover younger generation agreed.
"The more, the more dangerously it itself is with flights in the orbit", cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian federation concludes.
And, nevertheless, the humanity must look for new ways in the biotechnology, the ray protection and generating artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in the preparatory centre of the cosmonauts is a compulsory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a Schwebezustand the cosmonauts Routine win for the work in the open space.
The water shows the weightlessness.
Even if adult waters feel as pleasant, these are foreign surroundings; however, babies feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander report put away of the fact that the life in the country emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get used then lighter to water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the birth up to the first swimming just once 2 weeks pass.
"This is not enough a time to forget something", says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the weightlessness is a lot of more natural state, the woman gets by not without gravitation.
In the state of the weightlessness the belly musculature recedes and pelvic musculature enormously fast and with it also takes the ability to squeeze out the child.
Well, we handle by natal-prefatory aid.
The birth could take place, for example, also in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?", is the not unimportant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child needs also artificial gravitation.
Without feeling the earth's pull, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child can be put in the orbit not like an adult to the training in a load suit.
He will simply lack this what is for his life of elementary meaning.
"This experiment which we carry out together namely the birth of a child in foreign surroundings, will lead to the fact that we will give birth to a disabled person, to a completely non-conformist person", the leader of the bioethical commission of the institute of medical-biological problems forecasts COME ON, Igor Pestow.
Up to now the birth of children in the universe is a bare theory.
However, sometime it becomes a reality if the earthlings open in her spaceships to a distant planet which becomes the home for theirs in all born descendants.
