Poland and the space.
The last week Poland on a minister's council meeting of the member countries of the European space organisation ESA was taken up as the twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is with it the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (to Czechia which on the 12th of November, 2008 ESA member became).
Poland began in 1994 a close collaboration with the ESA and took part during the following years in several ESA projects.
The way of Poland in the space began, admittedly, much earlier.
Already before the Second World War Polish eager with universe dealt with the astronautics and they not always bumped with it into understanding.
I remind here, for example, of the talk from A. Š field Tern from the 6th of December, 1933 in the Warsaw observatory with which the author introduced thought from his pioneering work "to entrance to the Kosmonautik".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners, nevertheless, cold, and after years still remembered Š field Tern that merely Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Š field Tern REP deer won in 1934 for "entrance to the Kosmonautik" from Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch donated Prix.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became later an important advocate of the astronomy and the astronautics.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis worldwide approved contribution to the development of the astronautics was appreciated among other things by the fact that one of the craters on the earth-turned away side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railway hand trolley for which a rocket impulse was planned was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the draught and the details of this plan remained unknown.
It is not cleared yet whether the rocket should be used for starting or to the braking of the hand trolley.
Moreover the information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-pursued floors.
The institute of Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia led the research projects in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the traditional documents is evident that the research had penetrated till the stage of practical tests.
Then the research was interrupted, admittedly, by the invasion of the German armed forces.
In 1937 the draught coming from engineer Rohoziński of a fotoelektrischen hunting rocket appeared in the specialist publications, and in the next year appeared the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket impulse.
Shortly before the war all projects were co-ordinated to the military use of the rocket technology by the passing scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was furnished in 1937, nevertheless, after two-year-old activity his work was finished from the war beginning.
Other articles to the astronautics appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society occurs in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy in which four extensive articles of the astronautics are dedicated.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the foundation of a space society.
At the time there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the investigation of the space would have future.
Already in her beginnings in 1956 the Polish space society PTA took care of an entry to the international federation founded in 1951 for astronautics, and really became the PTA already in autumn, 1956 well-arranged member.
The next year the first PTA chairperson, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), acting chairpersons of the international federation became for astronautics.
He held this office up to his death in 1959.
Since 1956 took part the PTA decisively in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for the scientific research.
The first type, RM-1, was finished in 1957, the first start occurred on the 10th of October, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh completely 5 kg.
Later an improved version, RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 dów desert flight tests began RM-2 in the Bł ę with the two-stage rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
An other stage of development should be already able to perform real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight altitude from up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of height hoists.
In 1962, nevertheless, the further development was put.
Successor of the first rockets of the type RM became Meteor 1 rocket developed in the years from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, her total length amounted to 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed by this rocket (Meteor-1A,-1B and-1C) which differed of each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor 1A rocket disposed of a transport space with 0.4 litres of capacity, Meteor-1B more than 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C more than 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude amounted with all three types 37 Km.
In the years from 1965 to 1968 Meteor 2 rockets whose first flight tests began in October, 1970 was developed in the aviation institute.
Meteor 2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a pay load of 10 kg in a height by chance 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor-2H and meteor 3 were built.
The entry of Poland is also worth mentioning to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 which two years later the foundation of a national COSPAR committee followed.
Poland took part within the scope of the interuniverse programme also in the space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
