Cancer of the prostate early diagnosis: should the test be made or not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes shows faulty results, with wrong negative or, however, also to wrong positive results which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger hesitation of the already undecided men for the realisation of early diagnosis tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We have caught up the opinion of two specialists.
With studies carried out in the USA numerous sturgeon factors existed between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret these data and to give unequivocal recommendations.
An other study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference exists with the mortality of patients with and without early diagnosis.
This study has also shown that with a postobservation after 12 years the likelyhood of the education of metastases is from 30 to 40% higher if no early diagnosis was carried out.
Therefore, I recommend the test from an age of 50 years or 40 years if one has a direct relative who had already fallen ill with cancer of the prostate.
With men of afro more in American manner origin a higher risk also exists.
The most important is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer illness was recognised.
There are cancer kinds, the aggressively and others which are indolent.
To the patient the magnitude of the risk of his cancer illness must be really made clear, while to him the possible options are indicated with which to cancer of the prostate can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and one decides in these cases rather on an active supervision of the illness.
Today takes place with many men with whom one has recognised cancer, no treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and shows no menace for her life.
One suggests an active supervision to them and offers a treatment to them with progress of the illness.
One determines the criteria for a decision with increasing exactness who should be treated and who not.
Therefore, I recommend, nevertheless, the realisation of the test.
However, it is most important to speak with his doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to value the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevent the illness
Unfortunately, there is no wonder drug for the prevention of cancer.
In spite of the progress in the research the acceptance of a healthy life-style remains the best way to reduce the risk to fall ill with him.
It is estimated that 30% of the cancer illnesses could be prevented if everybody well ate and move enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise at least on 50%", stresses Andre Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.
Indeed, it is assumed from the fact that about 10% of the cancer illnesses are caused by inheritance.
Several remain also absolutely unsettled.
For the Canadian cancer society the fight against the tobacco dependence remains a priority, in spite of the decline of the number of the smokers.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancer kinds.
It strongly damages the health of the people.
"Even today there are in Quebec 1.5 million smokers", regrets the speaker Andre Beaulieu.
Reassuring data: 10 years after the renunciation of the cigarette, decreases the risk to die of cancer around half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer society overweight and Adipositas also promote the outbreak of the illness.
They seem to raise the risk for breast, colon, rectum, esophagi, pancreatic cancer and womb cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity protects during the whole life against colon cancer", he adds.
The food
The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In to large amount it raises the risk to fall ill with a fury or rectum cancer.
Sausages should be also avoided.
The preservation of meat by burning incense, dry or salts can lead to the education of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer", he explains.
Vitamins
During the last years several scientists have examined the connection between vitamin additions and cancer.
However, their investigations are not logical currently.
After the Canadian cancer society the studies are contradictory to vitamin E.
While a study has found out the reduction of the risk of cancer of the prostate, a rise pointed another rather.
The effect from vitamin D on the cancer was also not clearly indicated yet.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses how important it is to speak with his doctor of his doubts and his informal preload.
"The realisation of an early diagnosis test does not lead to cancer."
