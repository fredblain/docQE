In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored also sometimes
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours in the airport when our airplane fell out on account of mechanical problems and we had to wait for another airman.
I had enough time to make to myself a few thought boredom.
I do not want to lie.
To wait half a day at the airport at a flight, is quite nerve-killing - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more graduates and child development experts state boredom than some positive.
If it goes after them, it is okay for us - and our children - is occasional to be bored.
With it the brain is made lose itself in interesting lines of thought what possibly promotes the creativity.
And because most from us stare nowadays almost constantly at the one or other screen, the advantages of the boredom are not of benefit for us any more.
Should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I come back to it once again.
How many people also I have always assumed from the fact that boredom is a relatively topical phenomenon which has developed with increasing spare time.
However, Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and Roman history at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of "boron cathedral: A Lively History" (Yale University Pressing, in 2011) does not see this in such a way.
"Really the boredom has a very long history", he says.
Latin graffiti about boredom which decreases to the first century adorn the house walls of Pompeii.
And then is there still the question as we define boredom, actually.
John D. Eastwood, a related professor of the psychology at the university of York in Ontario, according to Canada the problem consists in the fact that boredom has defined in all sorts of kinds and has been discussed.
After long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the end, that to want to exercise boredom as the experience, "an adequate activity to themselves not to be able to do this, however" allows to define.
Boredom differs from apathy therefore from that point of view that the person is not occupied, however, this would want his.
With the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of the boredom, he says, insists in a "disturbance of the attention process, combined with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes only slowly".
Boredom can as sound with it almost as depression.
But professor Eastwood believes, although these both states could stand in connection, bored people see the problem in her surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think that to us is dull, even if we have only difficulties to concentrate.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German possibly: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention" which appeared in September in the technical periodical "Perspectives on Psychological Science", wise professor Eastwood and his colleagues on a former experiment with which participants listened to a tape on which a person read out a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring space which dealt nothing with the contents. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was hardly discernible, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
The people who heard the hardly audible television indicated to feel more boredom than both other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could find for this no reason and ascribed her difficulties of the boredom.
If one tries to concentrate upon a difficult or strenuous job, the disturbance of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, related professor for neuro sciences at the university of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If one, however, a monotonous activity exercised - "as well as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, can deflect music and help to feel not bored".
Really, so he says, now we know that Herumzappeln and scrawling, often interprets as a token for boredom, these can even fight, while people remain physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children, herumhampeln are allowed, learn more and keep more information than those which are forced for sitting still", according to professor Fenske.
To us to all an especially tiresome film becomes sometime once dull - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker.
But some people are lighter bored than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale to the boredom susceptibility" in the 1980s.
On the scale statements are found like "Many things which I must do, recur and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales researchers have found out that to boy becomes more often dull than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the university of Westflorida - in particular what concerns the need after more and a bigger variety of external charms.
But generally teenagers are a quite drawn heap.
In 1991 Reed Larson, professor carried out for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment with which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and her parents from seven to eight spots on the day with a Pager.
He found out that 32% of the adolescents were bored at school and while doing the homework, while 23% indicated to be bored if they were not at school.
However, only 3% of the parents indicated to feel bored.
Today professor Larson says, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages have risen concerning the boredom or have sunk.
Nevertheless, he is sure that "the youth is felt as especially dull", primarily because children and teenagers have no big influence on her everyday expiry.
Back to my origin question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in the extreme case she leads to the fact that people undertake extreme physical risks and go to ruin the game of chance or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown this.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the respect between boredom and creativity. Of this opinion is professor Vodanovich who investigates the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom the brain wants to say one that one should do something else", according to Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the university of New York.
But the brain not always knows what one should do just best of all.
If is dull and one uses this energy to play the guitar and to cook, one becomes happy.
However, at short notice though television can provide for feelings of happiness, these evaporate in the long term, however, again.
Who reaches to his bored child iPad, it can dissuade with it though from the boredom. Nevertheless, it has not learnt with it to talk or to control, says professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control spreads from a situation to other".
The child learns not only to talk, but also receives in other areas more self-control.
I do not think that we should celebrate boredom.
Also we should not see them too critical.
Instead, our aim should consist in feeling fine to us also off the constant activity and technology irrigation.
Professor Eastwood agrees to him.
"It sounds in such a way as if had to be more often dull to us. But boredom is the tantalising, incessant wish to do something sensible", he says.
He thinks that the people look in truth only for a way, to switch off and to relax.
"In surroundings in which we become constantly Ã¼berstimuliert it is difficult to deal if the noise has fallen silent once."
