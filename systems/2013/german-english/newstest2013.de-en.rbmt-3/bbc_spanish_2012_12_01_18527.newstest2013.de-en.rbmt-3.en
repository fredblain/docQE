Singapore needs babies to the rescue of the economy
The Singaporeans pin the blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the costs of the real estate and the child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: If we fulfil our civic duty and we create life!
It seems unplausible that the verses are a part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but still - or just so - they became at the beginning of this year in Singapore a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are a part of a rapper's song, the local sayings as for example "Will push a "bao" (loaf) in the stove to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH which has turned the video protects hope that the commercial in amusing way reaches to draw the attention to the problem.
Their creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of the music to bring the people to it, her "national duty" fulfil.
This is something only for Internet, therefore, we had to form it funnily and wittily.
It concerns the biggest problem in this country.
While reproducing we are the worst of the world, therefore, we noticed that it concerns a subject after which we had to look.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, as for example the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organisation of speed Dating evenings (quick flirtations).
Possibly that many of these ideas were creative, however, they did not lead to success compelling.
Hence, we thought: Why do we not make a little bit so creatively as possible to approach this problem, as for example to compose a rap?
1.2 children
Who takes this subject not easily, is the government of Singapore.
Every year she spends 1,300 US dollars on political measures to stimulate the citizens, to get more children.
A package of the government for married couples and parents grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends the maternity vacation and distributes tax advantages.
But everything achieved up to now little success.
Singapore is a rich, highly technological town state in the southeast of Asia which is also known for the conservatism of his governing and his strict social controls.
Presently according to his national population authority the birth rate lies with 1.2 children per woman.
The last time when this rate amounted to more than 2 - what also as a compensation rate is known - was in 1976.
So why do the Singaporeans not get any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, manager for marriage politics and family politics of the national population authority, says that this is due to a "better education" and "bigger career chances".
"This has enabled to the people to marry except and to form a family substantially to have more options concerning life aims and to set priorities", she explains.
These changes in the social circumstances have contributed to the higher number to single and in putting off the marriage and births whose result is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile led an immigration policy which is aimed at a drastic increase of the immigrations to counteract against the reduction of the population, to resentments with the local population.
In Singapore there are web pages where the hardly concealed xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese who are criticised for the fact that they hold the wages low and do not integrate themselves.
The increase of the immigration is also looked as one of the reasons about the fact that the government party achieved her worst election result since the independence in Singapore the last year.
Since elections an attempt was started correcting the problem with higher contributions and deliveries for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the inland revenue, the health costs and the immigration policy, the example shows Singapore also unexpected consequences.
The government tries to reach that so many small flats are not built.
Thus she already also has effects on the flat market.
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number in small flats which are known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the town.
These flats have a living space of 46 square metres and show a big sales success.
Indeed, the worry insists that they can promote the life style of the single, and that they deter the construction companies to build big flat for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company Tablespoon Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" much faster than bigger residential units are for sale.
They are so popular, and the units are faster sold off on days and even weeks than the bigger residential units.
This leads to the fact that they are much better for our Cash Flow.
However, he admits that the new norms give to the developers clearer orientations to which before obstacles were laid in the way if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a town state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase of the national birth rate, is to the talks with the Singaporeans who work in the finance quarter on inferring that they will have no big effect.
"The people are strongly put under stress, the flats and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many" says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me it is important to dispose of my own money and time" says another, about twenty year-old man.
Men and women state her career, the stress and the costs for the property and the education as reasons for the fact that they can have no children.
Therefore, the Singaporeans have the last word if it is a matter of getting children - there the government can still act so much.
