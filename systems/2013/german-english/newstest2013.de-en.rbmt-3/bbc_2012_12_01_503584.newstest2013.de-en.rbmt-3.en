Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico stands before difficult start
While future president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto on his assumption of office prepares, analysed wanting Grant of the BBC the challenges approaching him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Topically the traffic is particularly bad in Mexico town.
Even on better days is this one always congested town, however, on Monday a ring of steel was established which blocks off several important traffic routes in the capital and provides on the streets for chaos.
Nevertheless, the aim was not to disturb commuter on the way to work, but to hinder demonstrators, to reach the parliament.
On Saturday new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bandage and take over the guidance of the nation.
He stands before a complicated job.
Under the parting government Felipe Calderons Mexico could prove itself economically well, however, the country is in the clutch of a drug war which has already cost 60,000 human lives during the last six years.
"My government is strongly involved to reduce the power", explained Pena Nieto in the beginning of this week in the oval office to the US-American presidents Barack Obama.
I will suggest a new security strategy with which we can achieve this aim.
Before he went with the US-president on eye level, Pena Nieto acted as a governor of his mother country Mexico.
In this close settled, extensive part of the country which surrounds the capital the opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote provincial town of Valle del Bravo! one remembers, for example, with pleasure him.
Inhabitants of the holiday place ascribe the development of the tourism and the construction of the infrastructure to him.
To reach the town, one can go on one of the highways, the Pena Nieto allowed to build and one big improvement compared with the fragile, rough streets explain which there were here once.
Badges with his name also hang beyond a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum to the climate change.
"We expect from him real and persistent changes", according to his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez who works as a congressman for the party of Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular what concerns the security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change which needs our country so urgently.
After 81 years in power it was removed the PRI in 2000 from Vicente Fox.
The congressman Olvera admits that the party puts big expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto after 12 years beyond the presidential palace of lot Pinos.
The reproaches of the opposition, to the new president there is not enough substance, he declines.
He is a very direct man, very much engages and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, however, above all he is also somebody who can listen.
But on the other side of the state many people do not divide this view about her former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also famously as a Ciudad Neza, the contrast could not be bigger to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo!.
The place lies hidden under autooverpasses and shows in many respects a suburb of Mexico town itself.
And the problems in the municipality are from decisively urbane nature.
In the beginning of this year the military was switched on to fight against the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and power against women is an especially acute problem.
On a spot fallow land near a big garbage dump the corpses of dutzender murdered women were left behind only during the last two years.
During the term of office of governor Pena Nieto more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state Mexico - a statistics which even those of the city of Ciudad Juarez excels which is infamous for her power and the murders of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the view that he has approached the problem of the women's murders during his term of office at least not appropriately.
However, in the worst case his government has closed her eyes before the problem.
In a concrete structure, typically for the dilapidated quarter, Irinea Buendia with the tears fights when she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
Of the official version of the events according to Mariana committed in 2010 suicide.
However, her family thinks that it was murdered by her lifelong companion.
"When I came with her at home, it seemed as if her body has been washed", remembers Senora Buendia.
There was sign that it was hit, and the rigour mortis had already started.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks from the wall at us down. It is right beside a cross which carries one single word: Justice.
However, till present exactly this, according to the family, one has kept her.
The authorities have treated me as if I am a chatterbox, troublemaker, troublemaker.
They would want that one simply accepts her judgment and shuts up.
"But this is not possible if there were so many irregularities and omissions", she says.
If president Pena Nieto receives the presidential bandage on Saturday, he takes over with it also a big responsibility.
Ten thousands Mexican families were affected during the last six years by violent crime, and the new president has promised to look during his term of office particularly after this problem.
"I hope, as a president he is in such a way as he was as a governor", says the PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo!.
However, exactly before it the families of the victims are afraid in Ciudad Neza mostly.
