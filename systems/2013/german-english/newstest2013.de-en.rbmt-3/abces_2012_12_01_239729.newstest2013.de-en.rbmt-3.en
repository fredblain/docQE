"Valentino prefers elegance of the fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of the Couture" which was opened this week in London speaks ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion doer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital which is worthy of the accomodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has this by the opening of "Valentino - master of the Couture" approved, a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the haute couture were put together which were created by his "Maison" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his unmistakeable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a history whose only protagonist "il signore" Garavani is which could not have been written, however, without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino always felt fascination for the musty and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition which shall still be seen up to the 3rd of March there is a huge number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most select aristocracy, starting from which princess Salimah Aga Khan, about the princess Marie-Chantal von Griechenland and Margarita von England up to lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal recollections as trophies of his social rise of the modest fashion doer in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
To be in love in the nobility, must not be from disadvantage.
"At least they do not stamp out her springs on your marvellous carpet as it some nice fames from the pop music act", says baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We everybody were glad if we were invited in his house in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely makes friends with forgotten beauties as for example Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the fame.
And still he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion doer.
Many years ago we went after a fashion show in the Piazza Tu Spagna in Rome to him home to the dinner.
We were approximate 20 people, under it also Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
One recognised and felt his influence by every detail of his flat, the decoration, in food and in the music.
"All invited felt important and beloved", remembers the "top model" which began her career with the week of the haute couture in 1995 in Paris.
"He never falls out of fashion because his designs pieces of art are" she says finally.
Fashion show of the origin
The life of Garavani is no history of craze, rather from mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long catwalk which suggests a role exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" which carries masterpieces of Valentino, as for example the dress which Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes which Monica Vitti carried in "La Notte", or a coat from wool and leather which belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
In this audience from model types names shine like that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario von Bulgarien or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion doer, in 2006
Many of these customers say who is the first Valentino like the first love, "unforgettably".
I can still remember perfectly.
These were trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1971-1972.
"It was a present of him", says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer him to all others because of his great love for the women and because he emphasises our beauty,", the ex-duchess of Feria adds.
I like the colours, which he used, very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion-leading with the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola mountain D'aren cannot forget the first time when she carried Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamt of having, finally, the age and the opportunity of carrying one of his evening dresses...
Then in the end of the 90s it arrived, finally.
I bought to myself my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, which prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped upper top with a low neckline which does credit to his name.
"It was a true become dream", says the widow of Rodrigo mountain D'aren.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess mountain D'aren keeps her evening dresses of the fashion doer "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the recollections linked with it".
The "king" of the fashion
The big finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (how the fashion doer his seamstresses called) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a 4,5-metre-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the uppermost authority of the specialist publications, this dress was a landmark in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the uppermost society".
Now clouded for years with "savoir-être" of the élite, Valentino is her best copy.
Garavani so a lot of honour, how each of the husbands of his customers accumulates Cavaliere Tu grain Croce (the highest honouring of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre of the Arts et of the Lettres, excellent with the Legion of Honor.
"To me is always his cunning, his rest have struck cultivated and perfect appearance", admits mountain D'aren.
I have seen him the last time one month ago with a gala dinner in the museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was flawless; the time leaves no tracks in him".
And a princess says this...
