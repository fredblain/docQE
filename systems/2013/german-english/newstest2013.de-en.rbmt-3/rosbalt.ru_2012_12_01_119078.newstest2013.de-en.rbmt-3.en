Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde" which is dedicated to townsmen who form the avant-garde of the art and culture.
On the select list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene whose success after the borders of the town goes and finds the often recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller which in Red dressed bearded, one finds sometimes at the Russian museum, sometimes with the summer garden, sometimes at stage meeting or on art openings.
Where always the pictures are also issued by Kirill Miller, they attract big human masses.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical inhabitants of St. Petersburg social-philosophical artist who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the Petersburg avant-garde end of the 80th or beginning of the 90th.
He is also a man of the town and conjures by his presence on the street to his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides with them for good mood.
Recently he caught to himself a barrel organ and became the Petersburg barrel organ player, because he felt ready for this difficult role in view of his artist's existence, his philosophy and his image, finally.
- Kirill, why you are on the move, actually, always in Red and not, for example, in Yellow or turquoise in the town?
I have chosen the colour Red as a fashion designer who argues with the optics and the image.
In this world the compromise is Red between artists, image advisers and society.
In the society everything causes what soaks off somewhat from the grey norm, aggressions and bad behaviour.
However, I want to get into conversation by my provocations with the people.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation for the conversation.
- When did you know that you must become a painter?
- With an exhibition in the cultural palace Newskij with which my works were issued.
I understood that I must go this way.
Then at that time the time of the old free came to an end, however, not officially approved painter, and new and free painters like I were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from it there originated "Puschkinskaja 10", and then was first of all end.
It pulls me to the theatre, to the fashion, to the music, actually, to all, except the literature.
- And all this joined in your kind clinic... - It was important to me to stand in the centre of the Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should assemble.
In 1995 I took a space in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was up to the renovation works a musical-artistic club for the bohemian world, the house of the Petersburg bohemian world.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also reminds me how string with his project "Ucho van Goga" came there.
String and his friends sang easy songs to the Play forecastle, carried narrow tricots and to them the composer Igor Wdowin announced today also belonged.
When the group started playing live, became from her "Leningrad".
National costume mountain presented many programmes prematurely from "Halli-Galli".
We gave them national costume mountain, and it began his big career, but he learnt the bases with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have her origin in the kind clinic.
There went our employees and habitu√©s.
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture something else meant.
In 2000 there was in the press a survey by which it was about the honouring "personalities of our town".
I won in the category "Artist of the year", and with it I had arrived in the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the today's time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same one: One can be famous without making with it a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakeable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the subject "The Russian museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was social, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be thus.
In a clown all that blurs and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have absurd ideas.
If we save, for example, the world, while we prescribe that everybody has to disguise itself completely.
Now everybody pays attention to the clothes and orientates itself by the appearance and not in the inside of the person.
But maybe one may give to a person not the hand, but should spit to him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A cultural town should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can commercial art be also nice?
- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, thoughtful and flattering.
We see the decay of the cultures.
Earlier the people formed big groups: Bohemians loved One and easy people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to like all.
I am no Einhundert dollar mark which everybody likes.
Now you must consider who will like you.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- However, to the appearances of Stas Michailow several come Thousand!
- To him come desolate women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons there come 300 people and not 10 000, consequently there is less management, money, and everything perishes.
I have follower, and the most important is not to cheat them and not to destroy the achieved.
In my youth I have painted such pictures which hung with a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I began with pictures which ordinarily come only at the end of the career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture and consumption culture.
Consumption has generally no culture, this is something else.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money to be able to paint.
This is the culture which I recommend.
- Kirill what Petersburg is absent?
- Good cultural experts.
One says: Servant of the culture.
However, not each of them can deal with culture.
With the real czars it was different, because the czars maybe did not understand a lot from culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
Presently in Moscow there are good advisers.
In Petersburg we have which, the experts could be, but the way is obstructed to them, because it requires hochrangigerer experts who value the Ersteren properly and free to them the way.
Now only own taste counts.
The same is valid for the Erarta, however, with the difference that they say honestly that they must accept not all contemporary art and search some painters for themselves, therefore, other museums.
- What is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a suitable fertile soil.
On our stones art can grow up only hard.
We need a cultural fertile soil, because, for example, we have meanwhile more authors than reader, and, nevertheless, this is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us are much less.
Art must moulder again be, as well as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from subsidies of the city of Saint Petersburg
