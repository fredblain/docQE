The word "Human right" is absent in the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivaling rallies in Cairo reveal the deep splitting of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as a base is violently argumentative.
The Egyptian president did not save with emotionalism.
We must create the crossing.
"And that he succeeds, lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God", he said on the state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, above all, however, probably to the Christian Kopten, the liberals, to enlightened Muslims and secular.
Since they all, fell out up to now hopelessly in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God's state at the Nile of mercies of the mighty Moslem's brotherhood.
He has, said Mohammed Mursi almost apologetic which cut competence of the constitutional court temporarily and his competence extends "to save the revolution".
However, what the 61-year-old engineer who carries a doctorate of the American university of South California really wants to save, about that are the Egyptians, the world is not completely in the clear.
It should be stripped of power the Judikative?
234 articles which were flogged by the Islamic dominated 100-headed constitutional-giving meeting there in a night, 15-hour Parforceritt are actual partly alarmingly.
As in former constitutions also one says in the draught, the administration of justice founds on the "principles of Islamic right".
However, what is called "principles"?
This was and is an interpretation thing and it is to fear that the islamists will use the spongy formulation and the juridical elbowroom walking along with it for a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
At least an article hinzugeführter anew suggests this: In all matters concerning the sharia the Al Ashar university must be pulled advises, the most important Islamic institution of the country with big ray strength in whole sunnitischen Islam.
This does not have to go, but it can mean that the clergy supervises the legislation what would entail de facto the incapacitation of the Judikative.
A lot in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is an interpretation thing
Also problematically: The civil military jurisdiction should further maintain remain.
These courts served during Mubaraks rule for the suppression of members of the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The state should also protect, it stands in the draught, "the true being of the Egyptian family" "and her morality and her values promote".
This is juridically formulated so blurred that state institutions with the help of this article even the contents of cinematography and literature could control.
In plain English nothing else means than censorship.
No article, by the way, expressly establishes the equalization of men and women.
For it forbids to offend another to slander the prophet Mohammed and his envoys or.
What is, however, insults and how it should be avenged, remains unclear.
As dubiously the formulation seems, the "insults of people" would be forbidden.
Does a caricature of the president or a joke reach there already at the expenses of a lawyer?
Interpretation thing, like so a lot in the draught, the Mursi for the signature is given and will be presented according to his words "very soon" to the Egyptians to the plebiscite.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition forms up since weeks against the superior strength of the islamists.
Ten thousands assembled in unusual unity on the Friday evening on the place Tahrir in Cairo and promised to bring the charter to case, even before she can come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed of the presidential elections.
Nobel peace prize bearer and ex-boss of the International nuclear energy authority Mohamed El-Baradei explained, the constitutional draught belongs "on the pile of rubbish of the history".
Via news in brief service Twitter he accused the followers Mursis to want to lead a "putsch against the democracy".
"If he exclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said the oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not expiated yet", the Egyptian media cited the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not to want to supervise the referendum by which it would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well organised Moslem's brotherhood blew for their part to the counterdemonstration, as a precaution, however, not on the place Tahrir, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile shore before the Cairo university.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafisten took part in it and shouted: "The people demand the use of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi: "Clean the country!" and protested: "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for the Highness about the symbolic-laden place Tahrir on which everything took his beginning would have brought on states quite similar to civil war.
Mursis follower did not want to risk this quite obviously.
The Moslem's brothers explained, the opponents of the constitutional draught as well as the advocates would have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let decide the people in the electoral urn to which direction the country should go.
The majority for the draught of the islamists is valid as sure.
"The word Human rights not even seems"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, actually, up to February would have should go and integrate all social forces.
The 48-year-old lawyer of human rights and chairperson of the Egyptian organisation for human rights (EOHR) defended the Moslem's brothers when they sat under Mubarak in the prison or stood in court.
Not because he would divide their world view, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For it he was beaten up, condemned, arrested.
"And now the word Human rights not even stands in the new constitution", he deplores in the conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi power expansion on all three powers in the state let the lawyer resign.
These measures are a striking offence against democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt in a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the president cancels them de facto", deplores Saeda.
However, without civil-social organisations a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels abandoned, also from the international community which looks at the ideological direction fight at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could take revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "You gebährt a monster whom you cannot control any more."
