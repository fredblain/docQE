Begin of the course which studies the "middle of nowhere"
Every week the students examine apocalyptic subjects as for example the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.
He knew every semestre if the religious professor decided to hold a course about the middle of nowhere about that he disposed of an irresistible fishhook: the end of the "long reverse counting" of the Maya's calendar on the 21st of December from which many people thought that it means the middle of nowhere.
But Charmé had no notion what should expect him during the following both months: the destructive hurricane Sandy which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict with participation of Israel, to the place from which the Christian theorists think that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semestre which there one day was" Charmé this week said the student at the university of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If somebody analyses what has happened today in the world, as if we were removed thirty days from it, would be this one really good period.
And he reminds of the fact that the bad is well for that with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this semestre which should be, actually, last in the history courses about the "middle of nowhere".
In Temple the attending professor Barry Vacker gives the course "to media, culture and the middle of nowhere."
Every week the students examine apocalyptic subjects as for example the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.
"We analyse, which is why these ideas spread out with the time", he said, as well as the way, as hypothetical scenarios are offered which lead to a certain human behaviour.
If nuclear material reaches in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analysed films with apocalyptic contents and examined how they can be compared in comparison to the real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is likely possibly, plausible and impossible", said Vacker.
On the main campus of the university of Pennsylvania have formed the professor for Latin-American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an attending professor for art history and anthropology a team to offer a course with the simple name "The middle of nowhere".
"We do not take up in 2012, so that we always keep the option to be able to hold anew the course, for the case that the world does not set" said Restall.
In spite of the "forthcoming setting" the students must study, provide projects and take part in final examinations.
In kipping State the final examination in the eve of the apocalypse is carried out, which is why the students have no other chance to go on working as "till the night where the world comes to an end supposedly", said Restall.
The courses were liked very much.
"In two hours there were no more places" Restall said about his course for students by the high average which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the semestre beginning we received e-mails from students who asked whether still places are free.
The students for their part assure that the course counts to the most interesting.
"It is to be seen amusing what the people do to console themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect mentality or religious mentality is real only one question of consolation or his absence.
The 25-year-old student wanting Wekesa for psychology and nursing explained to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard somewhat of lessons where this is informed", he bragged.
I enjoy it.
But none of the questioned students - and less one more professor - declared to believe in the last date of the 21st of December.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of Maya, and in certain way we discredit them", said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from west Chester.
Maya never forecast the middle of nowhere; it concerns only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he marks that in the western society apocalyptic fear exists which goes back several centuries, as the people reacted to changes in her surroundings with the prediction of the middle of nowhere.
The Internet has raised these speculations.
"Elsewhere the people do not think in such a way", he says.
This is principal in the English-speaking world the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor of the university of La Salle who informs this year on the Philippines answers fast the question whether he knew there a course about the "middle of nowhere".
"The Philippines do not take part at the back of beyond", he wrote as an indication of an exception of a higher authority.
We have a pardon of the pope.
Restall pointed out to the fact that many days of the last court were spoken of the years, and said that if on the 21st of December nothing happens, "the people immediately of a new date think" or about the fact philosophised that the 21st of December is the beginning of a seven-year-old period after which the middle of nowhere would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they liked to go to celebrations about the "middle of nowhere".
"Maybe I call a few friends, so that we can laugh together", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
