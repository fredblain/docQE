Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most stinking fish of the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and this not only in Europe, but in the whole world.
Could the secret behind a success of the country something deal with the local appetite for quite stinking fish?
One takes a choice of overripe cheese kinds.
One places them in the midst of a heap of dirty, humid sports clothes.
And if she leaves there one week.
So about one must fancy the nasal-deafening smell of Rakfisk, one of the big delicatessen of Norway.
I am in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is here snow, spectacular sceneries - and this stubborn smell in the air which simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt a strewed trout who becomes - dependent of it, how stinking one would have his fish with pleasure - up to a year in water fermentiert.
If in Norway the darkness about the country comes and the weather becomes colder, Norwegians flow out to a party here in Fagernes which is dedicated to this, now, really very fascinating speciality.
"One eats it raw and rinses it then with a glass Aquavit down", says Havard Halvarsen which works, actually, in the local fire station, but when so-called "Rakfisk general" also organises the festival.
Round us people consume small fish cubes and take in addition large amounts in alcohol to themselves.
"To mush people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk", says Havard.
The spirit can edge out the smell.
I cost some morsels.
If one avoids bringing the Rakfisk in nasal nearness, he is not bad - possibly like sushi which has a rather long bus ride behind itself.
Rakfisk is the product of quite an other, by far poorer Norwegian epoch than there were still no chill possibilities and fish was watered in autumn in airtight saltwater barrels.
Then in the dead of winter he was taken out after long Fermentierung and - certainly under senses subdued help of alcohol - consumed.
Still one generation ago thousands of Norwegians in search of work felt constrained to leave her country and emigrated primarily in the USA.
Today the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing job market, high wages and a comprehensive health service.
Even of Sweden, the old rival who was by far richer before not yet much too long time than Norway flow out immigrants.
Rakfisk is looked as something important - as essential, even if strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history.
He belongs to the more expensive courts which one can buy to himself here.
But here, actually, everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not create it often in the world press, and this does not seem to disturb most people.
Here one still hates it to call different Breivik with the name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children the last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "incident from the 22nd of July".
Norwegians do themselves hard to accept that somebody is able in her peaceful country too such to crude murders.
Responsibly for head for the today's wealth of Norway is since the early 1970s years the growth of one of the biggest oil industries and gas industries of the world.
"But oil is not the only reason, why it goes well to us so", says Anna, our waitress who distributes round trays with ripe Rakfisk and embodies with her long blond hair and the piercing blue eyes the northern ideal.
We are - like one says - circumspect people.
Their English is exact like of most people here flawlessly.
We are not very braggart, we like no boastfulness.
Norway has handled with his oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the branch yields is invested cheers future generations in a special fund.
When during the years up to the worldwide economic crisis everybody threw with money around themselves which they did not own at all, Norway held his change purse firmly close.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and be a matter walking in summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And of course Rakfisk eat", it adds with lighthearted laughter.
I stand in the snow and act for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
So an Elch-Burger is anyway something else. The juicy meat tastes good to me.
But in the evening stands again of the Stinkefisch on the menu.
The hotel at which I stay is one of several venues which organise a Rakfisk dinner, with the guest for the best - or maybe the sences of smell strongest challenging - fish can be right.
There is a live TV circuit to a show master dressed in fly which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision song contest.
"Which score do you have there on top in the mountains for the best fish, Thor JÃ¼rgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
One claps and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, beaten possibly from the Aquavit.
But, nevertheless, maybe it is the strict smoke of the whole fish.
