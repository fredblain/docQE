"The people want that I save the republic, but I am only an amateur", states Okamura.
Mr. senator, how one has the idea to run for election for the office of the president?
It is not a matter for me of being a senator or president.
If in our country everything functioned without problems, I would nowhere run for election.
But I cannot look any more with at how the republic is looted for 20 years as thieves freely walk around, while the people the taxes and the retirement age are raised.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
If I see, however, something what I do not like, then I try to suggest a solution to change this.
And because I am already more than 40, and in addition independently and independent, I have no other possibility to influence the things, to run for election as for the office of a senator or the president.
In the senate you have created it and then have come along immediately on the way in the castle.
Do you thereby not turn to your voters the back?
I have said myself all the time that I take up the fight for the castle after the result of the senatorial elections.
Later I have specified this and have said that I run for election for the office of the president, provided that I am chosen the senator.
However, my aim is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realise my visions.
For it I need possibly a lot of influence and a very strong mandate.
The difficulty consists in the fact not only that we get angry as people in the bar and before the television, but massacre everybody which wants to change something.
In addition come the media which want to rob of the honour one, and which mistake to lie the freedom of the word with the freedom.
About me it was maintained, for example that I bribed journalists or that I was an adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
If we speak of your visions.
You have taken up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective property explanations more than 20 million crowns.
In addition you must change laws.
As a president you have in this regard no competence, and only the senate as a whole can introduce law proposals.
How want you to solve this problem?
As an easy citizen I have exerted myself for the fact that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be put through.
The problem is the small-spiritual politics - if somebody comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this is rejected intentionally, and this only detains the population.
As independent independents I dispose of a by far bigger potential to win support at all parties represented in the parliament.
My advantage consists in the fact that I can take without drawer thinking and party dogmas of every party this what is the best for our country.
Do you see yourselves as a person in the politics rather on the right or on the left?
From Czech view seems to me that me the people see rather on the left.
However, for me this legal link thinking is absolutely insignificant.
For me is important that we get on.
It is not for me about whether somebody belongs to the left or to the right camp; I would like to connect the people.
Always I support publicly every good solution beginning, even if this of the KSČM or from the ODS comes, and also I will turn against bad ideas.
It displeases you if somebody calls you populists.
However, do you not confirm by what you have just said?
If you put up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal aim and a vision.
And you would like to approach this.
One can call this because of me populism, but all proposals of which I have spoken already function in the world, or they were discussed by important experts.
But without support in the parliament only catchwords remain to you.
And with it you come not far in the politics in the long term.
Or do you believe that you if you talk only long enough with the people succeed in putting through, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other possibility.
To persuade politician, journalists and the public and to try, to bring them on our side to put through these aims.
As a president it would be for me no problem to request the chairpersons of the parliament parties live on television, to anchor the material and criminal liability for politician, officials, judges and public prosecutors legally.
And then the appealed would have to say if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality which points to mismanagement can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct choice of the president which was a salary of the public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have started with the politics scarcely and try to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge the things independently; and if it does not work, I decrease in six years again in the private sector.
This sounds a little, as if Okamura Czechia should save.
I am no rescuer.
I know that I reach alone nothing; therefore, I have spoken with several known personalities of whether they did not like to run for election also for the senate.
I have spoken, e.g., with Radim Jančura which declined, nevertheless, because of overworking.
Moreover, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who uncovered the deception with trade with light fuel oil.
I began my candidature with the condition that the people are deeply discontented, but now I am not sure any more.
Sixty percent of the voters have not gone at all for the elections, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representative of the establishment.
In the senate we are with it only two independent.
The people have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be only very hardly enforcable.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g., for the direct dialling of the mayors and district captains.
Do you think about the foundation of own party?
I have not thought about it yet because I have no time to check the past of every potential party member, and also at all the money for it does not have.
I do not have yet sometimes money for the presidential campaign; on my clear account are only 20,000 CZK.
They have no money?
They speak of property explanations, how did theirs look?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a property with a value of 25 millions, a flat for about 10 millions, next for 8 millions, an art collection which is worth about 10 millions, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 millions and Š kodu the Superb which is worth about one million. And then I have a few more millions on the account.
The Aston Martin was, by the way, a child dream - I always liked James Bond as he went in the car, was gallantly to women and fought at the same time against Bad.
They drive an Aston Martin, have a property of 60 millions and have no money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the republic, but you would not like to invest your own money in it.
This is not quite persuasive.
I have no 15 millions for the campaign.
Should I incur possibly debts?
I have already put 2.5 millions in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my programme probably wakes up not too a lot of interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from own means.
The costs for the campaign are covered basically by my salary as a senator.
But only from the senator's salary I could not live; thus I could not finance, e.g., to my son the English school which costs 30,000 per month.
If I wanted to earn only money, I would run for election for nothing at all.
Do you remain as an enterpriser active to have your living?
Did you not say that you drive back these activities?
But this does not hang together with the height of the salary.
As promised, I have partially driven back my activities.
Thus, e.g., my deputy becomes a manager of the travel agency in the spring.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.
But, nevertheless, I must also live on something.
To which monthly income were you accustomed as an enterpriser?
From about 200,000 to 400,000, and this also is furthermore in such a way.
Nevertheless, as a president I would completely put my enterprises.
You find the entire conversation in the Saturday issue of Právo.
