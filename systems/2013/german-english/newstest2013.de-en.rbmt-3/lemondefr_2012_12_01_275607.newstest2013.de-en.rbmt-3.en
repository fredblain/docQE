Real estate scandals of big magnitude in Quebec
Employ of the road construction office, enterprises of the construction head trade, Geldbeschaffer of political parties and specialist of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a wonderful "system" in which building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are involved.
An "industry" which was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, in particular in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange as the system disintegrates, since one has took drastic measures", Jacques Duchesneau, representative jokes in Quebec and former leader of the police of Montreal.
The scandal was uncovered by him on account of a detailed investigation of the misappropriation in connection with the contracts to road construction works in Quebec to which the prime minister at that time had agreed only with reluctance.
The "Duchesneau report" set up a direct connection between industry, confidential financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010", he stresses, "the traffic ministry would have saved alone one milliard dollars in the contracts", because, besides, some reined her instinct to receive her portion!
The Charbonneau commission "has already brought two mayors to case", he adds, in hope that she succeeds "in indicating the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unity brought to life in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unity brought to life in 2011 makes with her troops in chartered accountants, investigating and analysts of the government also big efforts.
Moreover, the policemen of the "Marteau troop" which has caused since 2009 that the "canalisation cartel" of Montreal goes forward with the artificial inflation of the contracts reserved...
During the last weeks she has carried out by the dozen house searches and has raised accusations because of deception and corruption against municipal mandate holders like Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb is.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt who has withdrawn just from his office as a mayor of Laval, the third-biggest town of Quebec.
He is suspected, in the exchange for public orders repeats bribes to have accepted.
Expressly, by the way, engineers of the road construction office were accused by Montreal, as well as enterpriser of Italian origin, how Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused sensation, while he has explained the functionality of the "system" of the preservation of public orders to the commission.
He himself has paid during several years 3% of the value of the contracts preserved in Montreal to one with the mafia in connection standing mediator who transferred the money to the union to Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has had in the 2000s everywhere his hand in the play, while he gave more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approx. 68,000 euros) in provincial parties, above all to the liberals former in power at that time.
He also confessed to have organised an unlawful middle procurement for the former liberal vice president Nathalie Normandeau.
The canalisation contracts whose costs were blown up by him artificially
In Montreal the "system" of the corruption functioned smoothly.
The former structural engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this before the commission in detail: in ten years he received from the building contractor presents, invitations for travelling, golf tournaments, restaurants and hockey plays, as well as bribes at the rate of 736,000 dollars as a consideration for the canalisation contracts whose costs he blew up artificially.
Other officials of the road construction office have admitted that they can be smeared, while they blew up the calculations with wrong additional achievements artificially about 30-40%.
Moreover, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay has accused that he has seen intentionally over a shadow household which filled his cashes with black money.
As a result of these exposures Mr. Tremblay Anfang November has withdrawn what overthrew Montreal in a heavy crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first representatives of Montreal whom alarm hit.
As a mayoress of the town district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled from 2010 against the sales of a local property that was acquired for 5 million dollars and was resold for 1.6 millions to developer in the booming property market.
70% of black money in the electoral campaigns
From the investigation which is carried out at last she says that it moves "in a thread which enables to understand the functionality of the system infiltrated by ants to stop the evil and to denounce the culprits".
She says that the procedure is "painfully, but positively".
We are about to clean the wound, however, would need an inquiry unity only certain for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent a return of the questionable methods.
How one cleans.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau marks on his part that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", however, comes along before all thought about the role of the "mandate holders who are about the tactics in the picture" if they were not involved in the deception!
Outgoing from a portion of 70% of black money by the financing of the electoral campaigns in Quebec he jokes: "To Me was said that this is only a weak imitation of the reality."
The government of Quebec suggests limiting the donations in parties to 100 dollars what would change according to him nothing in the situation: "As long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in the politics in the circulation."
He recommends a complete reworking of the system of the assignment of public orders and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; while we go for the things with courage on the reason, we can rebuild the house on a more respectable base with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international respect of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau requests those which laugh to have a look in her own backyard...
