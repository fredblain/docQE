After the court of appeal of the United States has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the obligations of the group Vitro which was reached about a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedence is created for every national enterprise with establishments in the neighbouring country which has payment problems.
One could say that the procedures have no validity to the survival of the enterprises who admit the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and Stripes in the contradiction to international agreements.
In practice the recognition gone out on the 15th of June of the judgment by the judge Harlin Hale in the court leads in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas to the fact that the Mexican enterprises of the seizure of her property are put out beyond the river Bravo! helplessly.
Indeed, the decision opens door and gate to the biggest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the uppermost court of law of the United States because of three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the thing points out to the fact that the believers must be defeated by the bankruptcy right of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit with headquarter in New Orleans says first that it concerns with the main procedure the commercial bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation is not known in procedure with insolvency by enterprise with land-covering profile.
Really the model law of the United Nations was created for this purpose for the standardization of the international commercial right and the American Law institutes was used as a mediator.
Secondly the judgment determines that without voices of the societies after recognition of the obligations in the bankrupt's estate which the branches of Vitro with her parent company had not the necessary majority would have been obtained for the restructuring of the obligations.
Indeed, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
Really Vitro is not the first case with which this pattern was admitted.
There is half-dozen examples, under it Agremex and Comercial Mexicana whose obligations were confirmed under enterprise of the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (federal institute of commercial bankruptcies).
Moreover, it is right that after deduction of the voices of the branches the believers from Vitro, the believers who complained at the courts of the United States against Vitro would have reached i.e. the vulture grounds as for example Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, no majority.
The vote would have gone out 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not considered by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, there is Vitro guilt for his difficult situation from 2008 within the scope of the big economic crisis in the United States which gave blows to the country.
That's why the family González Sada before the same court of appeal inserts contradiction, so that the vote occurs in the plenary sitting, i.e. from all judges because only three voted of it.
It is not granted to him, the Cerciorare objection which demands the examination of the procedure by a higher authority in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States is inserted.
The serious in this case is that the court left a document aside which was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) in what the procedure carried out by Vitro is described within the scope of the law about commercial bankruptcies, and in what is pointed out to the fact that it had kept strictly to the agreements signed by both countries to correspond to the chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
Moreover, it is pointed out to the fact that the country has submitted to the principles of the commission of the United Nations for international trade, i.e. to the agreed rules for the cases of international insolvency which guarantee the equalization of debtor and Gläubigern.
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
