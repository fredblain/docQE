In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea from sole
The promised land unites the magnificence of biblical truth, modern comfort and an untouched nature in itself.
AIF calls to you five most important reasons for a visit in Israel.
Before the holy sites bow
Visit the river Jordan in which Jesus was christened.
It means that everybody who have a bath in this river receives God's blessing.
Galilee is the place at which Jesus accomplished his miracles: the change of water in wine on a wedding celebration, the walking on the water, the Stillung of the sea storm and the fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Nevertheless, most sanctums are found in Jerusalem.
Believers commit here the suffering way or crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The way begins with the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old Town to the grave church on the mountain Golgotha where the crucifixion place, the Salbungsstein and the grave of Jesus are.
Here is in Christian view the navel of the world which symbolises the rescue of the humanity.
The cloister of the holy cross in Jerusalem stands at the place at which according to a Christian legend the tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple which was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 A.D.
Traditionally people of different religious directions leave there slip of paper with the wishes which come true then.
A trip undertake upwards
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the confidential hiding place before enemies, the Herodes the tallness in the year 25 A.D. for his family allowed to build.
They lie with a cliff face in the mountains at 450-metre height about the sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins from own strength.
An aerial cable railway brings all the others to this historical summit.
In the north of the country at from 1600-to 2040-metre height there is the famous skiing area Hermon in which it pulls countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you reach there by a shuttle coach.
The ski runways have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an old legend pagan gods at the mountaintop lived supposedly.
Unique museums visit
In this country there are nearly 300 museums.
With only one trip not everybody can be visited of it.
However, at least five most interesting from them a visit should be paid.
Under it the Israel museum is once not far from the Knesseth (parliament).
There old Qumranhandschriften or scrolls are kept by the dead sea which were found in rock caves in the Judäischen desert as well as about 500 000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
Also the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is worth a visit.
There the collection is issued by works of the impressionists and expressionist Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the bath the Al Basha which accommodates several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors at that time and bath servants.

The entry is free, and donations are basically rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, told by one of the most stupefying chapters of the history.
The most affecting department is the monument for the children which was built to the memory of the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
With the entrance of the space there rules complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And there sound the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.

Three most important recreation areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the dead sea.
At each of three places there are swimming-pools, water parks, dolphin arias and ocean arias.
Surprisingly it is bathed in the Red Sea also during the winter months, because the water temperature does not fall there under 21 °C and the air warms itself up to 23 °C.
The dead sea is even warmer and there it is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a situation of 417 metres under the sea level is the most deeply situated sea of the world.
His turquoise-blue water has a high salinity and thereby carries even non-swimmer easily on the surface.
The surrounding scenery is indescribably nice.
Visitors come here for treatments under use of salted water (natural salt sole) and remedial mud as well as to the treatment of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to the reassurance of strained nerves.
The secrets of the antiquity touch
The Old Town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa rescues these secrets on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this town ran the famous sea way which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia with each other.
The town is mentioned in Ancient Greek and altägyptischen legends.
According to traditions Noah built exactly here his ark, and Perseus saved here nice Andromeda with whom he led a long and happy life at this place.
