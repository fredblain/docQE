World AIDS day: Stamp, sing, help
In Heidelberg the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are glad about it.
The history of a connection which overcomes far more than 8733 kilometres.
First is there stamping: Cowboy's boots, gym-shoes, ladies' pumps and man's slip-on shoes search the tact on the parquet floor, find him quick.
Eins-zwei-drei-vier.
Then only the voices of the singers slowly rise - Old, bass, tenor and soprano - press, beguile and pursue themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductors, lifts it almost from his material shoes if he brings together them with his smoothly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music space of the institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg the choir rehearses Imbongi a new song.
To fifty singers and female singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist up to the househusband.
"Om'Obani" is no easy piece, every choral voice has another text and this still into very much foreign language: The Zulu which is spoken from eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mosambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Help to the self-help
Worldwide there are about 34 million HIV-infected, this estimates unaIDS, the programme of the United Nations to the Bekämfung of AIDS.
23.5 million people of it live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive, in the meantime.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village Esitjeni the association has found Voices for Africa godfathers in Germany.
70 of them visit a grammar school.
For 15 or 20 euros in the month one can take over a godparenthood.
She guarantees for the child college fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means on Zulu Geschichtenerzähler or also Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language fluently can speak in this space nobody, but sing.
For nearly ten years the choir practises songs into this foreign soft language and brings back them from time to time also there where they come originally: in the south of Africa.
Since there are 8 733 kilometres of air line of Heidelberg remotely, in the northwest of the kingdom Swaziland, the village Esitjeni which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in easy mucky huts and straw huts, a large part of it are children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents because these to the hi-virus shoot are.
In Esitjeni appears in the little one what completely Swaziland suffers from: the highest HIV-infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
Beschneidungen of the male foreskin which reduce the infection risk as can be proved around half are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus in themselves, at the middle thirty is to be died no rarity.
With a common Africa trip in spring, 2005 the choir discovered the village, above all, however, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets which lacked not only parental care but simply in all: Food, clothes, education.
Without graduation one has in a poor country only surely no chance.
In the beginning it was still the private engagement of singles to send a child to the school for some euro in the year and to allow to him a warm meal on the day.
However, already a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which looks since that time almost professionally after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts too sexually to transferable infections
What are the most important sexually transferable illnesses?
Syphilis, Chlamydien and gonorrhea (Gonorrhö) count to the bacterial STI.
Frequent viral STI are a HIV, human Pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Crab louses and Krätze belong to the parasite's eras STI.
Who are the main affected person's groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea seem above all with men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch's institute assumes from the fact that at least four of five all syphilis cases announced in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
With the heterosexual adults Chlamydien infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (mushrooms), gonorrhea and human Pappilomaviren are often seeming sexually transferable illnesses.
The spreading of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - still: About 20 percent of the HIV-new infections are cancelled to this group.
Among youngsters Chlamydien infections appear as substantially more frequent than with other sections of the population.
After European elevations three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years.
Besides, in this country human Pappilomaviren seem with youngsters often.
How has the number of the infections developed?
Not all sexually transferable illnesses are subject to registration.
The number of the syphilis infections has doubled according to the Robert Koch's institute of 1697 illnesses in 2001 on 3698 illnesses in 2011 more than.
The number of the HIV-new infections decreases since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than in the year before.
Which symptoms point to a gender illness?
The infection illnesses can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort in urinating, outflow, unterstomachaches as well as vesicles or warts.
Nevertheless, often they cause no pains or other symptoms and, therefore, remain unnoticed.
How can one protect himself?
Condoms can diminish the risk of an infection, however, offer no hundred percent protection.
Since partly causes can be transmitted by sexually transferable illnesses also by infections and narrow body contact.
Hence, experts recommend regular investigations above all with often varying sex partners.
Early diagnosed most STI can be cured and late results be avoided.
By godparenthood, donations and not least the fees, itself the choir in the whole of Germany ersingt, gathers something.
"All together we have sent quite about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the chairperson of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and penetration-strong woman, the money from Germany administers.
She also looks after the fact that the orphans well possibly find accomodation, with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as one calls the old women on Zulu, are the props of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans with themselves, give them a roof over the head and provide for the fact that the children appear in her uniforms every day on time to the school lessons.
Who has nobody more, comes to the protective house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is just paid by the association like both cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Besides, "Voices for Africa" has brought to life a Nähschule, has built two chicken houses and organised together with the American health organisation PSI that many left a HIV test in the village.
This is no self-evident fact, because so obviously the illness in the whole country also is, one hushes up them best.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it deals with sexuality."
Actually, strangely in a country in which the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, king Mswati III, is known for his excessive life style.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among the rest, it is also owed of this by the state sanctioned life form that the hi-virus has spread out in past decades so fast.
But also to many travelling workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms though on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote the cultural exchange something, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years together by the south of Africa and sings the songs of full melancholy, fight mind, confidence and black self-confidence which know many by the southern corner of the black continent still from times of the apartheid.
A coach of the full white who sing songs into black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has already wrested from some fierce border guards a few tears.
The trip leads always also to Esitjeni where the singers visit her godchildren.
Even if one hardly finds the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is known more than.
"Goes to Esitjeni, there is the light" the people say there.
And if one returns 8733 kilometres of air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the test space in the Bergheimer street, then one sees it shining also there.
