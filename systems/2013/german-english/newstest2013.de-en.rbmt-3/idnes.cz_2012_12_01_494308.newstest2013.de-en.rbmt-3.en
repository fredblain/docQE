Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"... that nothing originates from power, or could one day originate" Sting sings the fragile whose most important verse is in the refrain in the song: "... with it we do not forget how breakable we are".
"If my sons to no wars wanted, there would be none", says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of the power between Israel and the Gaza Strip there was, as usual, an immense number of reactions.
One stand behind Israel and argue with his right on self-defence, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others support the Palestinians again, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed in the Palestinian Arabs and call the state Israel terrorist.
I would not like to write at this point who is a victim in these always returning waves of the Tötens of culprits and who; at last the today's inhabitants of Israel became including the self-government areas in the present political situation hineingeboren and have not experienced the beginning of the power even.
It is a matter for me of opening the look behind the scenery for the readers, the look at to whom 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration are above all useful in November, 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East.
My thoughts partially rest on accessible historical facts, other are derived from these and arise from my own understanding of who influences the events of the modern history or which group of people decisively.
The history of the humanity is, primarily, a history of the fight for the power.
In every epoch we can put out Alexander the tallness or Napoleon.
That what is less seeming is the question whether these were really always these personalities themselves which determined her steps autonomous, or whether behind her throne somebody stood which steered her actions on a predetermined aim.
We must admit ourselves that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world concentrates in the hand of less singles, and that this concentration of the money and which has not originated from it arising power within the span of life of one generation.
Under this astronomically to rich families particularly stands out which one could call head of the octopus (I do not know whether about them still somebody stands, I do not exclude this, however) - which Rothschilds.
A lot it is not written about them.
Clear proofs.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought from Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of her name with highly criminal actions, in which background always the strengthening of her power which stood increase of her property or both.
Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks they wage wars or prepare on this (before the raid on Afghanistan these were 7 countries, after the raid on Iraq these were 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis only four remained and Russia has subordinated his central bank of the Russian government) in the interim.
Whoever has tried to oppose this family, had to pay with the life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war, own (speak: state to publish bank notes) and was murdered in 1865 at a theatre.
J.F.Kennedy began to publish own bank notes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the representative Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after he wanted to sue the FED because of release of the worldwide economic crisis in 1929.
The global power cravings of Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - in 1871 to the formulation of a plan to the Entfesselung of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of 33. and with it of the highest degree of the knowledge.
The first war had to the aim to remove the big monarchist state beings of Europe, in particular the colonial rule of Great Britain should be broken by the second war, and the third war has to do the world population on about 0.5 - 1 milliard people reduce (such a number would provide for her comfort and her luxury and would also not use so many resources), a universal religion create (the Ökumenismus is here nothing else as the approach) and, finally, for the takeover of the absolute power lead.
The method with which the group of the richest families with Rothschilds works at the head is the release of a crisis and the next offer of a solution (order from chao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the increase of the situation (see foundation of the FED, so that crises do not recur like from them in 1907 released).
After they had succeeded by the murder of the Habsburg successor to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo in releasing the First World War, they destroyed the Russian czardom by the revolution the Bolshevik.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically groundless capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian czardom the war was not necessary any more), afterwards the resolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary occurred.
To be able to kindle easier the Second World War, the bankers let by the politics create a latent conflict situation, while they booked Germany with huge Kriegsreparationen; thereby they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they had to unterrejoice the Germans only an enough strong leader who offered the culprits named and easy solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority which should take the function of the fifth column and also took to kindle the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement with which a branch aimed at the foundation of a Jew's state possibly in the historical area Judäas with Jerusalem as a capital (return after Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour declaration created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first collisions with the resident Arabian population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether now Hitler broke loose from the chain in which him the international bankers had held initial, or whether everything ran after plan, is only difficult to estimate, anyway the grief of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as by the Kriegsreparationen against Germany the way for the Second World War was paved, the proclamation of the state Israel shows the creation of the focus for the third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in provoking this war, the Jewish people become as during the Second World War the victim in the foremost fight line, this time together with the Arabian or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a gigantic lab, a spring of the quarrel and the chaos, not only in the country, but also internationally (one remembers only how sharply itself the people divide into follower and opponent of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who the victim during the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites where wrong releases only wrong in an endless spiral of the power and at the beginning the avarice of singles and her striving for global power stood?
One must make a distinction here between the inhabitants of Israel and her guidance, nevertheless, the international bankers place in Israel just as with us, the people, exclusively her own candidates for the choice.
The present prime minister of Israel whom falcon Netanjahu, a typical example of a susceptible to fascism one, to the international bankers is loyally of devoted politician who does everything for it to kindle a war with Iran which could expand in view of the membership of Iran in the Schanghaier organisation for cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly into a global conflict, and with which it run because of the control of Iran of the only 2 miles wide street of Hormus, through 20% of the worldwide oil deliveries to a destruction of the world economy could come.
In which light the words of David Rockefeller appear there from 1994: "The only what we need is a crisis reaching round everything, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In her image the new world order is a world of men and slave.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of finance aristocrats serves.
A world in which to every newborn child in the birth a chip is implanted to subject this being of the complete control.
"And it makes that the little ones and the tallness, the empires and the arms, the open air and the farm-hands all itself a multiplication sign give to her right hand or to her forehead that nobody can shop or sell, he has then the multiplication sign, namely the names of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Who has mind, that considers the number of the animal.
Since it is of a person a number, and his number is 666."
