Petronella Wyatt: I became from Oxford gemobbt because I am Tory
Not only university students from today are attacked for her views
Always it had been my biggest dream to receive a place at the university of Oxford.
My father as well as my older brother had visited that university which I held once for the biggest knowledge stamp of the world, for a modern Greek symposium which promoted the big columns of the civilisation - free thinking and tolerance-.
However, within two weeks after my move in the Worscester college in the end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and thus had caused the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening standard one said, I would have gone because I would have had a problem with the fact that fellow students had sex in the neighbouring room.
The author A N Wilson explained roguishly, I would have left the university because I was made drink from damaged cups.
However, the truth was less entertaining.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not possibly on account of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
One had on me only for reason harassed - a reason which seemed so more purblind in this supposed cradle of the enlightenment and crueler: My meanwhile late father Woodrow Wyatt had been important adviser Margaret Thatcher and me advocate of the conservative party.
Why do I mention this just now?
Now, according to topical reports a new generation of students of the temperate rights suffers from similar pursuit.
The organised and rising hatred on Tory student in Oxford has developed meanwhile such dimensions that a group of them the last week demanded the same equal rights protection, the gays, disabled person and ethnic minorities is of benefit.
Conservative members of the junior Common Room (JCR) of the body of Christ college brag, they are isolated on account of her political views "often actively, are attacked personally and explained for undesirable".
They demand a place in the equal rights committee of her college to make sure that her opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was aggravated by a recently emitted documentation about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories as an eccentric and neo-Nazis showed.
In it was shown under other graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student union of the university of Oxford who went in Rolls Royce and showed off with silvery suit and silver-occupied walking floor.
At other universities say conservative students, they are looked as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old hatches Black, vice president of the conservative student union of the university of Nottingham, let in a Sunday newspaper announce: "There is a growing link trend at universities.
The people believe, we are a club like the Bullingdon without having become acquainted generally".
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historical student in body of Christ who initiated the request for bigger protection takes the view, such a climate is "disagreeable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designate president of the conservative student union of Oxford says, she has observed a growing refusal towards students of the temperate rights with JCR members.
"This shows a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members", she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford I belonged to such a minority.
As incredibly shy 18-year-old I had come in September, 1986.
The hatred on the conservative party had reached his high point.
In the year before the university had been right to lend no honourary title to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - on the basis of shortenings in the university being.
The atmosphere would let even have startled Stalinisten.
In the first days of the first-year student's week with which new students become acquainted and the tutors I received a foretaste on the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors tolerated the derision of Tory students not only, but even with joys took part in it.
Political subjects like the miner's strike, the privatisation and the refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found her way in the wooden-panelled rooms of the seminar.
With mine first of these events I should translate French texts from the 18th century into the English. On that what should come then I had not been caught.
"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (meanwhile lately), "you translate please the first sales".
Besides, I tripped.
Pitt was a small man with a face like from cake dough, and quite abusively.
"Do refuse Thatcher's followers to learn French, or are they just silly?", he asked me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes tears boiled up.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours - in your spare time if you are not occupied too much with your social activities", growled me Pitt.
I returned with hanging head in my room.
In this evening I sat in the college alone with the dinner when me somebody easily tapped on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James who fancied as a member of the conservative student union.
"I know who you are", he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Everybody which is suspected of being Tory is pestered.
For me it is quite bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, therefore, it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first-year students pretend to be followers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I tried later to pretend.
I insisted on the fact that I was not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion.
This trick should turn out fruitless.
A university entrant in the field Philosophy, Politics and Economy who had visited ironically as conservatively valid Eton college said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist's pig".
You have got dirty.
Other students divided his opinion.
I was perverted and filthy.
"How do Tories sex have?", one asked me.
They fight mutually, or?
I felt in such a way as homosexual had to have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in leading a normal life at the university of Oxford?
Would be I able to meet like-minded people only after burglary of the darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclinations must suppress?
Three years which lay before me stretched before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of the proscription and isolation.
The only tutor who gave to recognise himself openly as a Tory was Norman Stone, professor for contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had discussed Thatcher in the matter of foreign affairs and had written for them talking.
He was there only seldom.
He hated the place, found him provincial and finely checked and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the university of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not become happy here", he said me.
I began to oscillate between Oxford and the house of my parents and took shelter with more open friends and members of the family in the town.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the men in his forties all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world", he said meekly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my town of the dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends always displayed flawless manners.
His humid eyes went cloudy.
Give to the whole a chance.
I am sure, one teases you only.
It would break to me the heart if you went.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London my emotional opposition became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory follower, had given way to the pressure and had renounced his convictions.
During a seminar the next week with which another historical tutor had seriously stated I am "an enemy of the people", I resolved to do the same.
Although I melted in petto before shame, I admitted that me my parents of a "brainwashing" had submitted, and called them "old idiots".
The relief continued only briefly.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote per week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my HÃ¤scher surrendered.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
With pleasure you can call me a tearful wimp.
But no 18-year-old should one day have to suffer in an educational institution from such intimidation and wickedness.
And it is even more tragic that it Oxford was hidden - a university which produced not only 14 Tory prime ministers but itself till this day behind an undeserved call by equal rights and freedom of thought.
