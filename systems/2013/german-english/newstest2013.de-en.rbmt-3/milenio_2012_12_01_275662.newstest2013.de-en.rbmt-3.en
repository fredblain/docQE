Today cause for a death because of AIDS is a too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when one confirmed the investigation result to him: HIV-positive.
"It was, as if a bomb hit", he says about the moment at which he received the diagnosis which the doctor tried to weaken without recognizable success "".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to look only after his illness and began to find out about it; and this with such application that he celebrated just his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unity of the hospital of Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the human Immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years what was hardly conceivable at the beginning of the 90s when there were many doubts, few possibilities of treatment and more stigmas.
At that time it itself avoided the manager of a clinic of the IMSS saying goodbye, "because it led in a dead end."
At that time AIDS was a synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
Indeed, still many people come to the clinic which know nothing about her illness and with those the virus already damage has arranged and has exhausted her immune system, and which are a victim of opportunistic infections.
Today 31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, i.e. after appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success means that the survival of a patient who takes up the treatment on time and the survival of the general population are precisely same", explained the leader of the HIV unity of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he said that this information has been supported in April of this year by a respectable scientific publication.
The expert for infection illnesses and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded since 2008 that AIDS is though no death sentence that, however, would take down the years of the survival and the quality of life on the degree of the interference of the immune system of the people with beginning of the treatment, and that those bigger chances would have which are not addicted to drugs: up to 30 years with a counting of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a counting of 500 CD4.
Simply said, the above implementation means that who receives the diagnosis at the age of 25 years HIV-positive in this sense "can become 75 years old trouble-free, as long as he stands under control", explained this expert.
To be able to arrange properly this progress, must be reminded of the fact that the life expectancy of the Mexicans amounts today on an average 76 years.
Even if the mortality has considerably decreased during the past years (in Mexico has itself the number of the people who die of AIDS, from 6.678 cases in 2007 on 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), it is still right that since the appearance of the AIDS 60 percent of the patients grasped in the national data bank have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the May of this year these are already 187 deaths; indeed, it is assured that there is universal access to the anti-retro-viral medicaments since 2005.
- Why still do people die of it?
- In my opinion the problem is not the access to the treatment.
This is my opinion, and thus is in our hospital.
At least during the past 12 years we had no care problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people come in far advanced state because they do not know her infection state, i.e. in very late phases of the illness.
He makes an apt declaration: "Nine of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. To be able to influence the global mortality, untimelier diagnoses are necessary, which is why recognition tests must be offered to all people with whom this is necessary massively."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee for the AIDS avoidance agree to this proposal in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio who allowed to carry out his test with a private lab, and this had for only reason because it a friend of him had made who was in spite of his young age already in the AIDS phase and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a crustaceous tumour) what is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they die, and would like to hear nothing.
"If I must already die, rather three spots burst", one says in my case.
The change was for the there improvement, I well live, go in for sports and take the drugs.
Today his parents know only that he had cancer.
I also live a normal life, how everybody other.
"I work, undertake a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and of the other person", Fabrizio enumerates who agreed to divide his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate that with his report which are afraid today within the scope of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how one can live like all people responsibly.
His news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and the easy citizen big holes exist, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara who has taken care of the thing of the HIV.
And the most important is the prevention.
At the places certain for it "the distribution was really raised by condoms; earlier they were delivered individually, now they give us packages to with hundred pieces what is quite good, however, there are still people who have no access to a condom", he said.
The youngsters count to the risk people for new infections.
For what do you need them?" a widespread mockery question of social workers, orientation staff is in schools, employees in chemist's shops and in the health system to which youngsters would not like to expose themselves, assured the correspondent.
He suggested orienting this ineffective distribution anew; the condoms should be not only behind the counter, but be visited in issue devices in public toilets by facilities, often from youngsters.
It should not be promoted the promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel as the governor Emilio González answered the question whether under his management preservatives were distributed.
"Sexuality does not look thus; It is best to give an understanding of the condoms those which already perform a sexual activity", he summed up it.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIVs).
The state lies nationwide seen at the 4th place of new and accumulated AIDS cases, and at the 13th place concerning HIV.
92% of the infection cases occur about sexual intercourse, 6% about the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people with HIV live because there are for every registered case 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
