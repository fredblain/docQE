Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The probe messenger has thought proofs of the fact that there is on the planet of Mercury Eis.
The sheet of ice should possibly be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he lies most near the sun, there also is there frozen water how it arises from three on Thursday in the professional magazine "Science" to published studies.
The probe messenger has thought proofs of the fact that there is a sheet of ice in the region constantly lying in the shade of the planet.
This should be up to 20 metres thick at least 30 centimetres and possibly even.
The water presumably came from comets or possibly also asteroids which have hit on the Mercury.
Nobody brings the finding of ice, however, with the existence of life on the planet in connection, said the chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, the findings could help in it to clear how waters and other stones of the life have reached in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed from the mortals are probes, telescopes and small robots like phoenix to investigate the depths of the universe.
Every now and then they send pictures to the earth: Small peepholes in infinite width.
The picture comes from a camera which German researchers of the Max-Planck's institute have developed.
Eight planets of our solar system, moreover, the midget planet of cerium.
Like Pluto which circles behind Neptune round the sun is of cerium according to the new concept definition of the international astronomical union of 2006 no "planet".
This screen window of an infrared admission of the top telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: The oldest stars are to be recognised as blue points, heavier the pink-coloured "newborn children" are to be identified in the star circle hall.
This star-pedagogic region - from scientists unromantic W5 called - has discovered the telescope sharpener in the star picture Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This fluorescent glow of a dying star has taken up the top telescope of the NASA.
The Donut shaped ring exists of material, this the star in the Sterbeprozess herausschleuderte.
In the gigantic Trifid fog, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars originate of gas and dust.
The top telescope of the NASA shot this photo of the galactic natal room.
At night the Plejaden star cluster, also "seven sisters" called, can be seen with the bare eye.
However, with the telescope the colours are better effective.
Like a red Age the Helix fog on this infrared photo awaits the viewer.
He is 700 light years remotely in the Aquarius sign of the zodiac.
His resemblance to an earthly continent introduced the title North America in this fog.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides for the spectacular colour.
This baby star could be taken up in his full beauty only by the infrared detectors of the top telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How these have originated, is one of the big riddles of the astronomy.
Possibly they are the remains of a Saturn moon which disappeared before 4.5 milliard years without a trace.
One of the biggest and most sharp admissions of the Hubble telescope: The jacuzzi galaxy
According to colour admissions of spiral galaxies become true pieces of art.
Shooter shows the Trifid fog distant several thousand light years in the sign of the zodiac the admission published by the European south observatory.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three parts, dreigespalten), there dark dust stripes the glowing heart of the star birthplace to 3 parts.
In the sign of the zodiac of queue bearers astronomers have taken a photo of the heralds of a cosmic cannon: 400 million light years of the earth the cores of two melting galaxies race remotely on each other to and will collide unavoidably with each other.
This star birth taped the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom technical abbreviations do not lie, that may call them with her nickname southern Catherine wheel.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a cutting from the iris fog in the sign of the zodiac Kepheus.
Of 1400 light years of distant fog exists of dust granule, from ten to hundred spots are smaller than usual house dust.
This picture was joined from optical and X-rays of different telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes, 430 million light years of the earth remotely.
This group of galaxies, Arp 273 called, took up the space telescope Hubble for the NASA.
Scientists UGC call the bigger spiral galaxy in 1810.
In this star fog there is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle produces always new Youngster.
Also this star cloud, linked with the rosette fog, produces constantly new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole still exists no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suppose that he has originated only shortly after the big bang when in the universe mainly hydrogen was to be found.
Our insights in all: The most important telescopes
The telescope should have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to the star observation.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became bigger and bigger - and the insights which they deliver, deeper and deeper.
During 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar observatory was close San Diego the biggest telescope of the world.
Spiegel, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, the USA, stands the Generous Binocular Telescope.
It admits looks in all immediately more than two mirrors, everybody with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner life of the grain Telescopio Canarias on the Canaries island La Palma is gigantic - only the mirror comes on 10.4 metres in the diameter.
Spiegel of the Southern African Generous Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter from about eleven metres.
Disadvantage of the favorable construction method: The telescope is in his height corner a festival-lashed - and with it in his mobility limited.
Also the amateur Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the height corner.
His specific feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This comes up because - in spite of relatively low reflecting diameter - to those of the worldwide biggest reflecting telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers all monitor after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Every computer owner can help with "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), while he makes available arithmetic achievement.
Look at the observatory of the European observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Generous Telescope - which does all credit to his name.
With his a total of four mirrors the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO observatory the European Extremely Generous Telescope is planned.
His main mirror should enclose full 42 metres - and be composed from just 1000 reflecting elements.
However, on pictures is to be calculated at the earliest in 2018.
Till 2007 both perky telescopes on the hawaiianischen volcano Mauna Kea were valid as the biggest ones of the world.
They offer immediately two mirrors by an average of ten metres.
The perky telescopes are a part of the Mauna Kea observatory which looks beside them still with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, gigantic telescope should originate - by a reflecting average of thirty metres.
Here it is to be marvelled at on an illustration.
Nevertheless, the space telescope Hubble delivers the most important impressions from all.
Since the 24th of April, 1990 it already delivers pictures of distant worlds.
Since March, 2009 the space telescope Kepler looks for extra-solar planets - particularly after such which are inhabitable.
On the 2nd of February, 2011 was announced by the NASA that 1235 planet candidates were determined since mission beginning.
In the picture the last start preparations in the space telescope Kepler are documented.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane5 rocket in all.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the duties of the telescope: It should look for light of the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists assume from the fact that also in the South Pole of Mercury Eis it exists.
Indeed, there are for it no dependable data, because the messengers far closer on the North Pole circles round the planet.
Radar measurements have pointed since decades to the fact that there is on Mercury Eis.
Now by the messenger probe begun in 2004 - the first one which circles round the Mercury - the scientists have certainty.
