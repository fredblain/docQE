"Protection of trade marks" in China: If puma and Armani become Chinese sudden
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What, however, is Armani Polo?
Behind it a name quite officially registered in China which deals, however, nothing with the origin enterprises is hidden.
Still she enjoys so long protection how the real name givers do not complain.
And is not clear whether it is received right.
"It becomes more and more difficult for foreigners to protect her brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in the office Taylor Wessing who is specified on protective law breakings in the Far East.
Every week a new case on my desk lands.
A few additional letters already reach to the imitators, so that they may announce her brands.
Thus becomes from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada one brings in Prada-Kny.
Also German enterprises are legally copied in this manner, possibly the sports article manufacturer puma.
Stalemate hole opens a folder with registrations of the brand office in Peking.
On the 14th of September, 2010 a Chinese enterprise let there the trade mark Zegna DF protect puma, an art name which also helped itself at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in the injured person of intellectual property, is known.
In the big towns there are the multistoried department stores who sell almost excluding forgeries.
However, stalemate hole cases are different: By order of his mandators he goes forward against the fact that Chinese enterprises from the brand office receive quite officially the right to use a name which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call "Bang Mingpai", a front seat passenger's brand.
The word orientates itself by "Bang Dakuan".
With it the women who hook rich men are meant.
The Chinese authorities do not feel responsible for anything
"This is damaging to business, one must fight against it", demands stalemate hole.
"The brand is diluted, the Alleinstellung disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial failures and the legal costs of the affected branches go to the millions, above all with expensive showing products.
According to the market research society CLSA China with a volume of 15 milliard euros in the year is the third-biggest market for luxury and the fastest growing one.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the brand register are difficult to reach and go to the money.
Up to nine years the procedure can stretch, with uncertain exit.
Stalemate hole reports about cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration the complained name has become the "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he must pay to the plagiarist even money because he injured his brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there rules here the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, that enterprise which took over recently the German concrete pump farmer cleaning master.
Therefore, the Chinese may use till this day an emblem which resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue-white logo which reminded of BMW; the quarrel was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who allowed to look the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities do not feel responsible for anything.
Though the brand office CTMO in Peking admits that there have been bottlenecks there in 2010 because of too low personnel equipment and office layout.
However, last year one has returned from the "emergency situation in the work routine to the normality".
Thus the continuance of raw objection procedures has sunk by 22 percent.
One has concluded nearly 57,000 such cases, 75 percent more than in the year before.
Still 81,500 objections still wait in the office for execution.
To begin against it costs a lot
As so often in China the figures are impressive.
Last year came with the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for protection of trade marks, nearly one third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China states for the tenth time one after the other the list of the new registrations all over the world, informs the authority.
This is also valid for the continuance of all valid brand names, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011 1.8 milliard yuan have been taken in fees.
Simplisticly this is called that every registration costs on an average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To begin against it costs a multiple how the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg points.
For more than seven years the group fights against a Chinese plagiarist.
Though the Germans could reach that his unlawful manufacture of artificial automobile parts was dug up.
However, the imitator protected the Chinese rights in the brand Joy mountain to himself furthermore.
One himself has missed this, because in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairperson of the management of joy mountain Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand office CTMO rejected the objection of the inhabitants of Munich also.
Though in the both next authorities joy mountain agreed surely, however, the opposing party fights on till this day.
One must pay attention like hell
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the thing to a good end, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely costly and costs us a lot of time, money and nerve."
The internal costs can be hardly numbered, the company archive had to look through even 100 year-old acts to adduce evidences.
Five years ago joy mountain of the opposition offered in vain a "high 6-figure euroamount" to the settlement.
"One sees in it, how much to us this is worth", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to Europe zur√ºckzuschwappen.
Because when to themselves there imitators protect unprotected brands.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer wanted to announce the name Joy mountain for shoes and leather in Germany.
The group has given up this business segment long ago, nevertheless, he could turn away the registration.
"One must pay attention like hell", says Wentzler.
He as well as the lawyer Pattloch advise German enterprises to be very careful by shops with China.
It does not manage on counting on international brand rights, rather the foreigners should announce "everything what is protection-worth anyhow also in China" as Wentzler says.
Otherwise this can become more expensive much than the registration.
Indeed: If joy mountain is defeated in the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay of the opposition royalties for own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed in the doubtful segment from the market.
