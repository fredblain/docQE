We have departed from Afghanistan.
And afterwards?
French troops have left her area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the USA might follow in the end of 2014.
It is in the time that the Afghan army takes the possession of her territory again, and that the Afghan population decides her future without expecting everything of us.
We have punished in particular the Afghan farmers, while we have looked at them as terrorists.
And to ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured persons and disabled persons.
The Taliban exist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from the farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, how at the moment of the Soviets.
They want to defend her ancient and archaic traditions, even if to them Dschihadisten, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek and Tajik have joined.
Tolerated, sometimes from the local insurgents supported, latter will not be there any more if the western countries become more discreet.
The deduction of the French troops of the base in Nijrab which I have observed from a hill planted with almond trees which was financed with the help of French loans occurred properly.
The truck convoys flown by helicopters and armoured convoys have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no more streaming of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since her irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996 the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country on account of the fights of the different riotous groups was covered by the war.
At that time their seizure of power was looked as a sort of freeing and return to the security.
The Afghan women have paid the price of the Obskurantismus of the farmers beaten by the organisation al-Qaeda, but her situation has not improved till this day.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and topical Taliban have the common wish to hold the women in a subordinated position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war have come into power in 2001 again.
They have changed into profiteer, while they have confiscated properties of the government to sell them as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus derived benefit from the massive American assignment of untermissions.
They have brought themselves in discredit, and most from them were not involved even in the fights.
How I have heard it in the campaigns, the people wish a government which does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those which could make the American allowances benefit to themselves: the flight of capital is substantial.
The young people are fed up with the war and with his ideologies.
During her exile in Iran or Pakistan they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population is less than 25 years; now Kabul has 5 million inhabitants what is one fifth of the whole population.
In the towns the state schools are completely from girl like boys.
One will have to make available to these young people who want to return neither to the Obskurantismus of the former parties nor to the corruption of certain executives jobs.
Everybody, also the armed parties, is owned by mobile phones; the television with his Turkish series which show a modern world is looked everywhere.
Now an army exists.
Are the authorities under whose authority she will stand looked as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight already take care of the restoration of the militia in the province which will avoid the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have profited from a certain decentralisation at the example of the western nations, but by abolition of the office of the Prime Minister which existed since the constitution of 1964 the USA from him wanted to make a centralised state with a strong presidential power.
President Karza√Ø wants no foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the elections planned for April, 2014.
Indeed, his country is dependent since the 50s and already long before on foreign help.
Industries were not rebuilt, functioning control works do not exist and important irrigation system were not repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The pas is given to the private initiative.
In a country which was ruined from 30-year war a state control of the infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumour was spread that Afghanistan would own immense mineral resources.
This still strengthens the impression that the western countries were only on site to seize of that.
Without energy to process the iron ore or copper ore on site, or without means of transportation for an export over the mountains no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, the international archeologists (financed from the world bank) on the gigantic Buddhist site allow to make her excavations and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will be also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan on which extensively the imports and exportations are dependent again produce normal relations.
The deduction of the French fight troops was concluded on the 20th of November.
The new co-operative agreement intends the continuation of traditional aid: Girl's high schools and young high schools, institute of French at the universities, French institute, cooperation in the military, juridical, medical and agricultural area, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 a service "of civil-military actions" of the ministry of defence (Cimic) which was put in 2012 in dozens of mountain villages has carried out numerous charitable works and measures for the renovation of the agriculture and from a small French non-governmental organisation allow to carry out to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to reach the impossible job of the compatibility from aid and offensive actions.
These works for which numerous local manpower was necessary could serve to suppress the uprising: Irrigation, well, drinking water, rereforestation, fruit-trees, soil conservation and rise of the agricultural usable areas.
Which souvenir do we leave behind after military expenses of two milliard euros?
A lot of more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of the local living conditions which are very hard in this often at a height of more than 2000 metres of recumbent valleys.
In the message dozens written inquiries have come smaller of agricultural plans of municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
So that the farmers of the uprising controlled by foreign groups escape what is her wish after her own statements, the continuation would be lower, well more controlled and they was necessary directly of concerning civil aid in your favour.
