My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced on account of the missing chances to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they call to them heavy times in the memory, he says
Navarrette takes the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a kürzlichen trip to Mexico town I had crossed scarcely the hall and had come in the passport check when desperation spread in me.
Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").
I stood there during some seconds uncertainly, to which I should proceed.
I have grown up in Zentralkalifornien and my whole life was called long "Mexican".
An ethnic abbreviation - just, as my friends are called in Boston "Irishmen" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later I decided on "Mexican American".
But here this was Mexico.
And in the native country of my grandfather there was no need for Kürzeln or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself into this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not dispose of the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I also do not get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and positioned myself in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment of this week when the future Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet president Obama.
On the agenda stood all those subjects which one expects if the heads of these both countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also interested very much to speak of the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for the fact that Mexicans remain nowadays with as high likelyhood in Mexico instead of emigrating in the United States.
He would like to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and create a North American commercial block according to model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he called concerning this no details.
Relation of Mexico to the United States is complicated and full resentment.
Most Americans presumably never waste one single thought of the fact that the United States occurred in 1848 in Mexico and made the guidance of the country under reproached gun leave to them more than half of her territory.
But for the Mexicans who think during centuries and not during minutes recollections of this event are not to be overlooked.
As soon as an US government official practises even the mildest criticism to Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and under the élites of the country - discomfort upon how the Americans press the sovereignty of her neighbouring country.
And the children Montezumas proceed on the warpath.
And, nevertheless, the biggest challenge of Mexico lies in truth in the respect with the more than 35 millions Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Desire to speak of resentments?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winner and loser. The people for whom the country offers chances, and others for which it this does not act.
The only reason, why so many people of Mexican origin live in towns like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, consists in the fact that in a point in our family tree a person - maybe a parent or grandparent's part - got no chance in Mexico compulsory and emigrated in the direction of the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - swarthy, ill-mannered, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is valid for them.
Not Mexico.
And although we live maybe now the American dream, good schools have visited and have received good jobs, we may never lose out of sight that it is the American dream which we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity has sometimes become blurred possibly, but what concerns our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is valid unambiguously for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that to us many members of the Mexican ruling class may not.
This is based on mutuality.
They look down to us as a memorial of a mortifying defeat and look at us because we are Mexican enough not.
Our Spanish becomes never good enough, our gang to Mexico be never strong enough.
In your opinion our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And now then we would not feel behind the silk curtain caught - with a pleasant life lost in the United States, but anyhow.
My woman who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated as a child legally in the United States reminds me of the fact that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions exist because Mexicans own a clearer image about who they are - and Mexican Americans take amiss them of this.
While she is an US-American citizen, she sees herself as a part of two countries.
However, many Mexican Americans whom I know have the feeling to belong neither on the one hand nor to the other country.
We love the Mexican tape lot Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, has rooted, however, in none of it.
In Mexico we are seen as an American.
And in the United States we are seen as a Mexican.
How I should learn during my trip, there is something which makes this respect still more complicated: Some Mexican leadership people and parts of the educated classes would like to resume her connections with the Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico who represent her interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleague about how great a visit of this country is and pressure on the political guidance exercise to intensify her connections to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the unrestrained corruption and the drug power many of us are not sure at all in such a way whether it really concerns a great country.
I fear, there you have to go alone by, Amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready yet to award to the United States for the contact with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans look after a rancour for how her members of the family were treated only before not at all so long time.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "Mexican" when I thought.
