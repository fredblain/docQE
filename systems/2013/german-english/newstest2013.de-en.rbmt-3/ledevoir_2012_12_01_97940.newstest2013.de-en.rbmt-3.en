To die Palliativpflege - the best way | Le Devoir
With her committee on "death in dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the awkward question of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a law draught is prepared.
Indeed, remains in this important subject area still a lot to act.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. still lived alone in his flat in the Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate which consumed him left him a term of two years.
"You gave me to live five years, I have created seven years", he said half-heartedly, in his bed at the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil recumbent at which he had come the day before.
"However, it is always a shock, one cannot be prepared for it", he says.
The illness makes her work: an extensive weakness stops him from going only on the toilet and from eating independently.
At the table before a tasty lunch sitting, he agrees resignedly to let help with food.
Courageously he succeeds in smiling even and in speaking with the strangers who are occupied round him, to him his drugs bring, and offer him a bath.
The courage of the usual death.
"It is my biggest wish that one cures my failure, because this is mortifying", he informs.
Some hours later the team has found a remedy for this evil.
"In the course of our life we find out that a man pees in the standing position", tells Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home Victor-Gadbois.
In the childhood phase is to be returned for certain people an unacceptable humiliation.
"This depends on the ability of the person" to accept a backward step, he finds out.
Since in the opinion of several people who work in the Palliativpflege big events take place in the midst of these backward steps.
The patients who are sent in the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois suffer everybody from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In this stage they are not showered by the doctors and nurses who look after them any more with so-called "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear, "is to be died consciously and by suffocation".
But by the illness I have really got to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no more wishes in the life", she says, before she accepts that one puts on her one mask which helps her in the breathing.
She expects during the next days, nevertheless, still the last visit of her son who comes from Italy.
At the home Victor-Gadbois one offers with a group of voluntary personal care and assistance with the absorption of nutrients.
The Palliativpflege is used when there are no other more possibilities.
To form the death more pleasantly.
In Quebec a bed comes on 11,700 inhabitants for the Palliativpflege.
This is very little if one considers that we will die one day everybody.
Here the life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
At level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One grants an oral hygiene with brandy or Pepsi to the dying as desired.
The diabetics must not control her blood sugar level any more.
And the death is a part of the everyday life.
Last night we have served Mr. X a beer who has died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink up the beer at feet of the dead.
"We help member and patients equally", reports nursing manager Nathalie Savard.
At the home Victor-Gadbois no day is like the other.
Beside an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his pillows, while one stumbles to his honour, a young man dies of 36 years who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his both small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.
"Since six months from three to five beds are always booked with cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years", informs Dr. Christiane Martel uneasy.
53% of the patients sent in the home Victor-Gadbois come from her dwelling, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of the access to the Palliativpflege
One says that 77% of the Canadians have no access to the Palliativpflege, i.e. to a care which should relieve the suffering of patients if latter the final stage of her life have reached, at home, in the hospital or at a nursing home.
And several organisations, how the home Victor-Gadbois and the society for domestic Palliativpflege in the metropolitan area Montreal specialise more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this big inadequacy in the health care of Quebec provides for the fact that several doctors specified in the Palliativpflege of the discharge of a law of the regulation of Sterbehilfe and assisted suicide with doubt await.
Since the October a manifesto is in the circulation which was signed by prominent personalities of the Palliativpflege like Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to state her contradiction to a such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel the health system of Quebec is not efficient enough to make sure that have all right on a qualitatively high-quality Palliativpflege, before one accepts to go over to the Sterbehilfe.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient who was 14 days with big pains in the provisional accommodation, without one has took measures to her relief.
I fear that the patients want to die because they receive no adequate health care.
And at the same time several Onkologen treat her patients in spite of the worst forecasts dogged up to the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimum when she has broken off an unwieldy chemotherapy.
When I have informed of my Onkologin that I break off the treatment, she has answered to me that she regrets that I give up the fight, she told.
Indeed, she had said me that I am at the end!
No omnipotente care
Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of the patients, have asked to die, thank the nursing staff that it has not granted to this wish, after her pains have been relieved by a team of the Palliativpflege.
However, one is clearly said that the Palliativpflege are not with the pain treatment omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, leader of the Palliativpflege of the society of the domestic Palliativpflege of the metropolitan area Montreal 8% of the patients do not respond to a pain treatment.
Completely at the end of the life the doctors fall back therefore often on the appointment ale sedation which runs out to put to sleep the patient either sporadically or permanently up to the time of his death.
We can act no longer in such a way, as if we do not perceive this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will have more and more often the possibility to fall back on this appointment ale sedation.
The patients whose pains are not relieved say everybody the same sentence: "I want to die."
But this does not mean necessarily, "I want that you put to sleep me", but "I would want that my pains are relieved".
The realisation of this report was possible on account of a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
