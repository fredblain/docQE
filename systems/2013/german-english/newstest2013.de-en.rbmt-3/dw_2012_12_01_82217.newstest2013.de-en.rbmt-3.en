Szabo: "Germans must play bigger role"
Germany has abstained in the vote about the admission of Palestine of the voice.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert for US European relations, balances Berlin with it on a narrow diplomatic degree.
German wave: At the beginning of the week Germany had first signalled that it would be right against the application for an observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
Then, however, Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza, not.
Now, however, Germany must be careful on account of his special respect with Israel.
But at the same time I think that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without being, however, too critically towards Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March, 2011 Germany has also abstained from the voice when it was a matter of furnishing a no-fly zone.
This was put through, finally, by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to cover a clear position with important international subjects?
Yes, this is right.
This is due to the fact that it just his foreign affairs change namely away from a politics which became, so to speak, from the USA gemanaged, to German foreign affairs.
Aggravatingly comes that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform politics.
The Germans are found between the fronts against.
One expects from them that they play a more independent role, however, they are not accustomed to it.
I believe, they still feel way to her role, but they are on the way to "more normal" foreign affairs.
Foreign affairs, as they have France or Great Britain.
What do "normal" foreign affairs mean then specifically from German view?
She shows the readiness to cover positions with national interests also which are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I think that the German foreign affairs are motivated by the economic policy, so from the exports and his relations with certain regions, possibly Russia, China or the Middle East.
Economic interests of Germany are to a certain degree differently than those of the other big powers and, therefore, Germany must protect his interests.
Have these economic interests had influence on the position during the Middle East conflict and the vote in UN?
On the one hand Germany has big outlets in the Middle East, particularly in the golf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public, but also the Ã©lites, in the Arabian countries.
This plays anyway a role.
But I would not want to attach also too much weight, this is no absolutely one-sided respect.
But it plays anyway an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged his relations with the USA, while it has abstained by important decisions of the voice, possibly by the vote over Palestine?
I believe, in Europe and even in the USA rules big understanding for the German position.
Therefore, I do not think that this was such a dramatic break, how in the Libyan question.
Maybe Germany will warm up with it even a certain respect.
Since, nevertheless, it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and his interests be roofed.
There are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The USA against it have expressed themselves clearly for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?
On account of the American domestic policy these differences have always existed.
I think that the government probably has quite a lot of understanding for the European position under Obama in petto.
But on account of the political situation here, the government cannot represent this position publicly of course.
I think that the actual differences of opinion are not so big at all as they always appear.
If you have a look at the relations between Obama and prime minister Netanjahu, Obama is not at all thus hellauf enthusiastically from Netanjahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on his close relations with Israel and the USA on one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe, exactly this makes it so difficultly for the Germans.
It would be of course a little bit easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European politics what is not the case currently.
So they cannot be a part of a broader line and must speed up, instead, things from her own position.
They make this just with the euro.
I believe, in future Germany will take over a leading role to push Europe to a European position.
This is not of course simply for Germany, already because of the respect with Israel.
This was always a sensitive subject.
But I think that to the Germans is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as a more importantly international player - wants Germany to take over generally a leading role?
Or is Germany the leading role still difficult?
Germany is not accustomed yet to it, this is still disagreeable and, for evident reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
If we look, for example, the eurocrisis, there become every time if Germany accepts a bigger role, the most different anti-German feelings freely.
This makes it to the Germans not easy.
This is, actually, the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Thus Germany is seen in a lot of more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptively for the most different neighbours and opinions and this is not easy.
Now the influence of the USA decreases in the European politics continuously, the EU does not fill at the moment this vacuum, however who remains there, otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they does not like it, it is disagreeable to them and still makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!
