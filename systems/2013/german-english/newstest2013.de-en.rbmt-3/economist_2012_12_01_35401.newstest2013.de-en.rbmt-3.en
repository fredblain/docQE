Old battles, the new Middle East
The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could turn out unexpected mainstay for the peace
Can there one day be persistent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The newest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual apportionings of blame countless buildings were razed to the ground, more than 140 Palestinians, most of it civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time have smashed rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem caught during her historical conflict, the Middle East changes round them.
The Arabian spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become a part of this confusion.
Maybe this will lead only to more bloodshed.
However, there are reasons for the acceptance that the deadly deadlock could come, finally, to her end.
A war which is neither lost nor is won
At first sight optimism in view of the topical situation seems anything but right.
Even if the armistice agreed on the 21st of November stops, the dieswöchigen fights have strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas, the Islamic movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007 will claim himself to have forced back the Israelis, although his grouping itself had to register big losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are penned up in one of the most wretched and close populated Estonian corners of the planet, till present Israel has not succeeded in destroying the Hamas.
Really gains the Hamas in West Bank which is controlled by the rivaling, temperate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come in the end that they have the time on her side.
So how islamists have won in the Arabian world in influence, could pull the Hamas mighty and rich friends on her side.
Turkey, a regaining strength, regional power which was valid once as Israel of the narrowest Muslim allies has seized for the Hamas party - exactly like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic golf states.
Rejoicing Hamas followers think that around Israel an Islamic half moon forms - from Lebanon in the north where militant Hizbollah has the power, over Syria where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren coinage could stand before the Stürzung Bashar Assads, up to Jordan where Hamas ally threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Moslem's brotherhood under president Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - to the most important Arabian country inhabitant-strongest by far - in the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region with lasting effect.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizistische despot who governed Egypt up to his fall in 2011 during 30 years had only little time for the Hamas, for the rest.
By contrast the brotherhood with the Hamas verschwägert and her leaders is stronger dependent on national views.
At future diplomatic negotiations could turn out the Hamas as an actor who himself cannot become from Israel and the United States herausgedrängt.
However, the Israeli hard liners infuse an opposite conclusion.
Military is seen the Hamas no more danger.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron of cathedrals", could prove itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while long Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic regard the United States stick steadfast to her position. Many European countries have held responsible the Hamas for the newest Gewalteskalationen.
Israel has well gone out it during the last years, in particular under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu who has ignored the peace process to large parts.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively freely from suicide assassins - not least thanks to the locking arrangements, in West Bank and with it in the main part of any Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements which were explained though for against international law, however, on and on are developed.
Netanyahu well stands there. His Likud party has formed an alliance in the approach of the elections on the 22nd of January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even more combative group.
Why also these underhand Palestinians pamper and leave to them own state?
If they really had the control of West Bank, would they fire then not exactly like her comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip also rockets?
No, it is better to keep in check them behind the wall and to punish, they should dare to lift the heads.
Maybe the hard liners will be able to assert themselves. However, the Arabian spring could foil them.
Even if the islamists who sit now in Egypt and in other countries in power have a little for Israel, for the rest, they will concentrate first upon the difficulties in own country.
The defensive budget of Israel is bigger than of his four Arabian neighbours together.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arabian governments hardly in the repair of her economy.
The fact that the pragmatic president Mursi with Barack Obama got together to reach an armistice, a promising sign could be - and symbolise maybe the beginning of a new era.
Also Israelis should think more in the long term.
While the remaining Arabian world takes timid steps in the direction of democratisation, Palestinians are robbed furthermore of her self-determination right - a powder keg which will explode certainly one day in the Israeli occupied areas, exactly how this week a coach exploded in Tel Aviv.
By now the suppression undermines the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arabian population this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to the Zurückdrängung of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand about the years increasingly her diplomatic tribute.
Both sides need an impulse from the outside
The right answer is that which will represent from the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the large part of the remaining world and from this newspaper: Two states with which Israel resigns areas for security purposes.
- for the close future small - hope consists in the fact that the armistice grants to outsiders more influence for the penetration of this solution.
Now Egypt must stop together with Turkey and Qatar the deliveries of arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before, around the Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on basis of the borders of 1967, complements with area exchange and common Jerusalem to be convincing.
Outstanding Arabian nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to an arrangement.
With it would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Also Obama must serve his part to move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office he missed the image of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems as if he was declined also a participation.
However, this is an unfortunate, shortsighted perspective.
The United States have an essential interest in the stable Middle East.
And if a peace agreement belongs to it between Israel and the Palestinians.
