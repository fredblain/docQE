Š imon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than one month the end of the world should take place?
This is one of those disaster announcements at which we jump at people so with pleasure.
With our volume The Tap Tap we make fun rather of it and say that we are the only tape of the world which can collect enough positive energy to detain the end of the world or to prevent.
Moreover, in December you realise a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce to our readers the project closer?
It concerns a national benefit performance event which we already plan two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya's calendar whose end is forecast for 21st of December at 11:10 o'clock in the morning.
On the day before it, i.e. on the 20th of December, compensate 21:00 o'clock at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava instead of.
The end of the concerts should be in possibly at the time at which on the Pacific island Kiribati which lies in a time zone about 12 hours before us the Maya's calendar ends.
From whom does this idea come?
Originally probably from ourselves, afterwards we have decorated the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Besides, we would like to collect not only enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we would also like to think together with the public about it in which state we hand over this world once to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya's calendar we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key followers against the end of the world with whose purchase about www.e-tap.cz to us the people can also support.
The volume The Tap Tap has together with other interpreters, moreover, also the so-called. Hymn against the end of the world with the title "End of the world falls from" taken up.
Already today the hymn on YouTube is liked very much. Will she also sound on the charity concerts?
Of course, namely completely in the end, provided that everything claps and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn should be sung about all interpreters on all three concerts at the same time.
Moreover, the hymns will broadcast live together in a direct circuit of the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomá š Hanák which also plays the central figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X joins in the singing...
How have you come to the cooperation with both?
We also co-operate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene what hangs up together with the fact that we realise many benefit performance events and concerts...
We try to integrate these people intensely into our projects.
Besides, has appeared that most are interested in a cooperation with us, and have fun in it.
For which purpose is the proceed of the concerts of benefit against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the educational centre of Studeo without barriers on which we already work six years together with the association Tap in the Jedlička institute.
The schoolboys of the Jedlička institute are examined regularly by foreign language assistants who help them at different leisure activities.
Because the schoolboys themselves do not dispose of the means to visit the foreign language assistants, we would like to help them in this manner.
In frame of the completion of the Jedlička institute own building in which we enter then with this project should originate.
With every concert several groups and interpreters appear.
According to which criteria have you selected this?
We wanted to put together a programme which responds all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, China ski step, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří visit ý.
You find out all other one on the Internet site www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May we appear for the first time in the Prague spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
The next year we would also like to appear with pleasure in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are then already in the USA - would connect this also with pleasure with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans are not quite small, up to now you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
Nevertheless, The Tap Tap is a group which consists of people with impediments.
How do you master these trips logistically and organizationally?
It is not so bad as it appears at first sight.
Five our members are wheel chair drivers, i.e. the wheel chairs must be carried in the left luggage office. Moreover, we must carry along of course many instrument suitcases and other luggage...
Nevertheless it has up to now always worked without problems, ČSA and British airways were prepared always very well for us that I have sometimes partially already been surprised.
Even in Moscow where we were recently there were no problems.
By your foreign tours you have a comparison as it looks in the single countries with barrier freedom like one there with handicapped people handles etc.
How have you experienced these things up to now?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other towns in which everything better functions than with us we were just in Russia witnesses of that that in the east still everything is in his beginnings.
Compared with Prague Moscow is suitable for the handicapped not at all. There it is still unusual if somebody is on the move only in the wheel chair in the city centre.
It is not natural there yet that one lets go in front a wheel chair driver, for example, in the lift.
Fortunately, also originate there associations which try to point to the problems of people with impediments.
And in which regard we must catch up compared with the developed countries?
There are still many things in which we hang behind...
However, in addition is still to be marked that an improvement of the situation also depends always on the endeavours of the affected persons.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely usual that also people move with heavy impediments independently in the public space, go to the museum, toilets can be of use etc.
However, it is not quite usual that there a bigger group of handicapped people takes part actively in the social events, in it we are with the volume The Tap Tap to the west a little ahead!
Respect in public and barrier freedom is a thing, but only if from our rows of important sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come, will really start the things to change.
Up to now are this only isolated cases of especially strong-minded personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular currently. If we decrease, however, a few years: What has motivated you in 1998 to found a volume?
At that time I started as a responsible person in the Jedlička institute where I met many young people who were interested to deal with a little bit intensely.
And because I myself am a musician and play among other things the saxophone, I have founded together with a colleague a music AG.
Well, and with the time this is, like our presenter, Láďa Angelovič, is in habit to say, (laughs) a little bit out of control advisably.
Was the tape known, however, only during the last years, or crazily I me?
It is right that the cooperation with known singers has helped us; moreover, we have also started advertising actively to ourselves.
To us has become conscious, that if one performs something and this is not to be seen to the outside which does not exist own achievement in certain sense.
Moreover, thanks to the EU-conveyor money we can afford good foreign language assistants, high-quality devices and among other things.
Was it your aim to bring it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the outset I have felt the potential that one can differently concern the things.
Today in the show business one often copies the other.
This is logical in his manner, because all new with care is looked and is accepted only after longer time.
There are only few really unique things, and I dare to state that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression which the spectator mostly has is of course a compassion; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people are no lonesome and desolate beings with impediments which we would have to regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided that they have the means necessary in addition.
I always say that when person succeeds with impediments something, this is not only for themselves a progress, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, how does one hear from many people?
If one liked to make good something, one may enter in many things no compromises and must also call a certain discipline.
However, this is absolutely normal in my opinion.
Some come to us with romantic images, and if then they find out that they have test twice the week, preparatory phases must finish and spend a lot of time on concert travelling, then the enthusiasm goes out with many fast.
However, thus it functions everywhere, in every volume which seriously wants to work and reach something.
Currently The Tap Tap has twenty members.
Besides, how many of it were from the outset, i.e. since 1998?
Only just one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent this.
Who has the will and is always welcome the desire in taking part, with us.
