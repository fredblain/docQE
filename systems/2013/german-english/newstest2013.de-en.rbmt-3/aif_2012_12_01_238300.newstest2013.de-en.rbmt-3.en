"Big and mighty" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While representatives and civil rights campaigners discuss it of which use the law about obliging linguistic tests is for migrants, criminals already act with phoney certificates
Yearly 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other towns of Russia.
Most from them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remained in the native country.
On the 1st of December a law came into force which according to every working migrant certifies a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, must put away.
Up to now this regulation is valid only for the migrant who want to work in the service industry, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail trade.
However, the tests should become with the time according to federal migration authority in future for all foreign workers the duty.
Besides, one must file not only linguistic tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the bases of the legislation.
Linguistic proficiency must be proved for the preservation as well as the lengthening of the work permit.
Exceptions are valid only for citizen of countries in which Russian is an official language.
Are also excluded from this law people who have received her education reports and certificates before the decay of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problems and protection of the rights
The totality of the exam places will stand under the aegis of the Pushkin's institute of the Russian language, the Russian university of the friendship between nations, the Moscow state university, the Petersburg state university and other Russian colleges.
The migrants can file the tests in all towns; by now were opened in Russia already more than 160 suitable centres.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the representatives of the state Duma and the federal migration authority.
However, civil rights campaigners put before the introduction of the law in the press several times the following question: What does the whole bring, actually?
Which changes make does the regulation have to show linguistic proficiency, for the Russians as well as for the foreign workers?
Above all, speakers of the migration authority reply, it is a matter of reducing the number of the forced laborers.
"Now many talk about the protection of the rights of working migrants", says the leader of the representation of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Nevertheless, their rights must be already protected against her departure.
Only one organised recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Migrants bump into problems without occupation, education, linguistic proficiency and medical investigation.
Sebelew is persuaded of the fact that a future migrant without linguistic proficiency will meet necessarily person with bad intentions which put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow barrack where he will endure with dozens his equals months without food and documents and from 12 to 14 hours on the day slave.
A lot of discomfort reaches us from our migrants.
"In the native country one is promised to you, and on arrival you are cheated, her passports taken agree and do not receive the promised wage", confirms the leader of the head office for working migration of the tadschikischen migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Do not get angry, boss!
Still admit many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn her money in Russia, that they not only cannot control the language of the aim country, but express themselves also into her own language hardly in writing.
Of course this is not so much her guilt, when rather the evil: Only few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford just one reasonable basic school education.
Since in her families there is not money yet to nourish the children, never mind, to buy to them decent clothes, shoes and school things.
Then as teenagers these children take straight away the first opportunity to the moneymaking.
"It is difficult without linguistic proficiency", they admit.
"You feel degraded and inferiorly."
Civil rights campaigners stress the following important aspect with regard to the law.
Only migrants with legal status must file the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no check and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile the large part of the foreign workers stays furthermore illegally in Russia.
"Pretty welcome "or" admission for unauthorized forbade"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to receive an official status in Russia.
The reason are bureaucratic hurdles and of course the linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, the legalisation costs money: From 12 to 16 000 roubles.
One can make a phoney registration fast and merely for One and a half 000.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mainly faked and are not registered us, and then from it there originate cases of extortion.
"You want hundred or 200 roubles for cigarettes and tea", the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow expresses himself towards journalists.
"Only no costs for wrong papers shy"
Already on the day in which the law came into force turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be faked.
Some phoney certificates which certify the Absolvierung of the linguistic test already became from employees of the federal migration authority beschlaggenommen.
The phoney papers were printed with a usual colour printer.
Of course the new owners did not receive this free of charge: Every migrant who hoped to be able to save himself thus the tests paid 7000 roubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much like the costs for the official test: This costs a working migrant to 3000 roubles.
Office-bearers as well as civil rights campaigners agree about the fact that the most important immediate job consists in it to protect the system against corruption so that the certificates cannot be simply bought.
For the moment the authorities can promise to the foreign workers who fall the first time by the test only that they receive time for a linguistic reason course.
In addition, places are offered to newcomers without linguistic proficiency in areas in which no active notification with people is necessary.
