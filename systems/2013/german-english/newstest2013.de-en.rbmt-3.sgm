<h1>
<seg id="1">A republican strategy to walk towards the reelection of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The executives of the Republicans justify her politics with the need to fight against the electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">Indeed, the Brennan centre latter holds for a myth, while it confirms that the electoral fraud is rarer in the USA than the number of the people killed by the bolt of lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lawyers of the Republicans have registered in 10 years in the USA, by the way, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One is sure: these new regulations will affect negatively the election turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to Canada the US federal states are responsible for the realisation of the elections in the single states.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this sense the majority of the American governments has announced since 2009 new laws which complicate the procedure for the registration or the urn way.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has won after the elections from November, 2010 in meaning by which 675 new republican representatives could be registered in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Consequently only 180 law draughts in 2011 which limit the exercise of the franchise in 41 states were introduced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws require that the voters present a photo identity card and a proof of the US citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the periods are shortened by these laws also for the untimely casting of votes, the right is declared for invalid to register itself in the election day as a voter, and citizens the franchise arranged for which a court act is given.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections of 2006 no US state of the voters has required to show a photo identity card.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first federal state which has raised a such demand.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutional moderation of the law of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The republican authorities hastened to expand this practise to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the course of the last both years they promoted in 34 federal states law draughts with which the voters are made show a photo identity card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to mark that the US citizens do not dispose in contrast to Quebec of a universal badge like the health insurance map.</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 millions elective people own none of a government authority of her state issued photo identity card.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters do not dispose in 2012 of a such identity card.</seg>
<seg id="21">Indeed, are to be paid often more than hundred dollars to receive the necessary identity card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Young people, minorities and people with low income are concerned by the new restrictions unreasonably strongly.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, do not dispose 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the people with an income of less than 35.000$, 18% of the citizens more than 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years of the necessary photo identity card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This still hands on.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is not allowed to the students who are looked as a voter who give her vote increasingly for democratic candidates in several states to use her photo identity card issued by her equipment.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, the same states permit it to members of hinge associations or hunting associations which stronger choose for the republican side to use the maps issued by these associations for elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004 no federal state for the dialling has demanded a proof of the citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first federal state which introduced a such demand.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011 laws have dismissed one dozen states which demand of the voters that they prove her US citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly designed to limit the B sharp-panic voices.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since it is obvious that two of three B sharp-panic voters, the democratic party prefer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, republican legislators have promoted in 2011 the laws with which the registration was abolished by voters in the election day in eight federal states.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to perform assistance to those voters who would like to register themselves.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not no consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, the campaigns have served to the electoral registration by the general elections in 2004 to register approx. 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since by the measures adopted since 2009 the portion of the registration of new voters has decreased in 2010 in comparison to 2006 about 17%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Moreover, the republican legislators have dismissed in five other federal states laws which are designed to shorten the period for the untimely casting of votes.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, there were by the general elections in 2008 in Florida 33% the voter which have chosen in advance, Afro-American, although they put out only 13% of the voters of the federal state.</seg>
<seg id="39">Same is valid for the B sharp-panic population.</seg>
<seg id="40">The latter put out only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">By contrast put out the white who showed 76% of the voters, only 46% of the voters which chose in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course the democratic legislators and her followers have energetically opposed the discharge of the laws which limit the registration of the voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several law draughts were blocked by the vetos of the democratic governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The advocate general of the USA has intervened to put out the most argumentative laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">They could limit the damages partially.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 34 federal states have dismissed the laws which require showing a photo identity card.</seg>
<seg id="47">Indeed, the rules introduced anew will complicate in 2012 certainly the exercise of the franchise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The democratic critics to pillories the party political nature of the adopted laws in and see in them as a clear aim the influencing of the results in for 2012 decisive states.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Brennan centres of 2011 shows that those states which have dismissed these laws put out 171 270 voices which are necessary in the electoral man's committee to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes of the regulations in the electoral system have considerable effects on the result of the presidential elections in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one is sure: these new regulations will affect negatively the election turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the USA.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Cancer of the prostate early diagnosis: should the test be made or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Indeed, the PSA test sometimes shows faulty results, with wrong negative or, however, also to wrong positive results which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">This leads to stronger hesitation of the already undecided men for the realisation of early diagnosis tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Should the test be made or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have caught up the opinion of two specialists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With studies carried out in the USA numerous sturgeon factors existed between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret these data and to give unequivocal recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">An other study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference exists with the mortality of patients with and without early diagnosis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study has also shown that with a postobservation after 12 years the likelyhood of the education of metastases is from 30 to 40% higher if no early diagnosis was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, I recommend the test from an age of 50 years or 40 years if one has a direct relative who had already fallen ill with cancer of the prostate.</seg>
<seg id="10">With men of afro more in American manner origin a higher risk also exists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The most important is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer illness was recognised.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are cancer kinds, the aggressively and others which are indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">To the patient the magnitude of the risk of his cancer illness must be really made clear, while to him the possible options are indicated with which to cancer of the prostate can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and one decides in these cases rather on an active supervision of the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today takes place with many men with whom one has recognised cancer, no treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and shows no menace for her life.</seg>
<seg id="15">One suggests an active supervision to them and offers a treatment to them with progress of the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One determines the criteria for a decision with increasing exactness who should be treated and who not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, I recommend, nevertheless, the realisation of the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, it is most important to speak with his doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to value the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document (currently only on English, but a translation will be available shortly) can be downloaded at the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Prevent the illness</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no wonder drug for the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In spite of the progress in the research the acceptance of a healthy life-style remains the best way to reduce the risk to fall ill with him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that 30% of the cancer illnesses could be prevented if everybody well ate and move enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise at least on 50%", stresses Andre Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Indeed, it is assumed from the fact that about 10% of the cancer illnesses are caused by inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several remain also absolutely unsettled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian cancer society the fight against the tobacco dependence remains a priority, in spite of the decline of the number of the smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is also a risk factor for several other cancer kinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It strongly damages the health of the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Even today there are in Quebec 1.5 million smokers", regrets the speaker Andre Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Reassuring data: 10 years after the renunciation of the cigarette, decreases the risk to die of cancer around half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the Canadian cancer society overweight and Adipositas also promote the outbreak of the illness.</seg>
<seg id="36">They seem to raise the risk for breast, colon, rectum, esophagi, pancreatic cancer and womb cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that a regular physical activity protects during the whole life against colon cancer", he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In to large amount it raises the risk to fall ill with a fury or rectum cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">Sausages should be also avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of meat by burning incense, dry or salts can lead to the education of carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer", he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">During the last years several scientists have examined the connection between vitamin additions and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">However, their investigations are not logical currently.</seg>
<seg id="47">After the Canadian cancer society the studies are contradictory to vitamin E.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While a study has found out the reduction of the risk of cancer of the prostate, a rise pointed another rather.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect from vitamin D on the cancer was also not clearly indicated yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses how important it is to speak with his doctor of his doubts and his informal preload.</seg>
<seg id="51">"The realisation of an early diagnosis test does not lead to cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs-Boson analyses</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs-Bosons has caused in last summer a certain sensation, and this for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Indeed, one thinks that this Boson is involved in nothing less than in the mechanism which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And, finally, it concerns the last particle whose existence by the standard model - our best or "was not observed in the least wrong" explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter - forecast, but empirically yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physicists it is not sure yet completely that it really concerns the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without shade of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it resembles the Higgs-Boson forecast by the standard model strongly.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data which were introduced this week on a big physics congress in Kyoto, but there are still no still to be sure about that completely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">If we assume, nevertheless, from the fact that it really concerns the Higgs, because apparently only one low risk exists to be mistaken, and we look about what it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is in this world a necessarily unavoidable law which causes that two objects cannot exist at the same time at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not possible to offend against this rule - and if you do not try it too strongly, because you will hurt yourselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Since even if particle physics is a really strange world, turns out that also a such law is valid for them: the Pauli'sche the exclusion principle which says that two particles cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" and this "state" exists on the whole of some of her qualities.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of it outgoing the physicists divide the particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione and obey courteously the Pauli principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in the others move the Bosonen, a bad gang of anarchists to whom nothing is holy - anyway not this principle what means that they can be, indeed, at the same time at the same place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These Bosonen are made up according to the web page The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboren (which is up, by the way, absolutely astonishingly) in two groups: the Mesonen which we will not treat here and the "strength particles" by which the big forces of the nature spread and with those the Higgs-Boson anyhow would be related.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, one is stressed here that these Bosonen are not all so exotic creatures as one could mean.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a Bosons of unusual banality: the photon or the "light particle" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic strength.</seg>
<seg id="18">If because a particle with an electric load accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this place, in possibly like a pebble stone which was thrown in a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">An electromagnetic wave (light, infrared radiation or ultraviolet radiation originates from this "disturbance" etc.), and this wave is nothing else than a photon and therefore one of the Bosonen "bearer of the strength".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Same is valid for the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the field Higgs, must be "disturbed", so that this Boson appears.</seg>
<seg id="22">Indeed, the field Higgs is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the cause must reach very high energy, a little comparably with a frozen pond whose surface could become furrowed only from a very big rock.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, a gigantic particle accelerator is necessary like the CERN - the Generous Hadron Collider is a ring with an extent of 27 km! - to reach around such energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful once more to explain the respect between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">Indeed, these are not all particles and not all materials which interoperate with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like magnets, do not do this, but other - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold by itself in the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">And equally there interoperate not all particles with the field Higgs: those which do it own a mass, while other (how own, by the way, the photon) no mass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For what can all these researches be good now "", asks Mrs. Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For the science they serve the examination of the standard model (N.M.), and they also enable to the physicists to examine all divergences between the observations and the predictions of N.M. exactly.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are, by the way, numerous physicists who hope most ardently that such divergences are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to "new physics" and mend some holes of the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">One must say that the latter still big defects show, because it no explanation of the gravitation (ups!) and the dark matter offers which forms approx. 80% of the matter of the universe (once more ups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, such divergences till present were not found with the CERN.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Effects</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The effects of these researches for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be to be supposed wrong that there was none.</seg>
<seg id="35">By the way: in the early 60s years the pioneers of the laser have not supposed in the Bell labs that her works released a such revolution.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific uses, but, otherwise, nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle has us - who has worked in the barking of rennet in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and which in 1962 even the first long-term line laser (the first ones were pulsed) has developed - already said that the laser was looked at the beginning rather than a "lab game".</seg>
<seg id="38">Fancy...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Moreover, uses can also arise from all instruments which surround the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, has developed again Willard Boyle in 1969 during his works in the optics a small light sensor.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves all digital cameras worldwide as "an eye" and has introduced in him in 2009 the Nobel prize for physics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change necessarily our life, but it means that one can never know it really...</seg>

<seg id="1">To die Palliativpflege - the best way | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">With her committee on "death in dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the awkward question of the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must be resumed shortly, although a law draught is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">Indeed, remains in this important subject area still a lot to act.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir has tried to look at this closer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago Mr. L. still lived alone in his flat in the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The cancer of the prostate which consumed him left him a term of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You gave me to live five years, I have created seven years", he said half-heartedly, in his bed at the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil recumbent at which he had come the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"However, it is always a shock, one cannot be prepared for it", he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The illness makes her work: an extensive weakness stops him from going only on the toilet and from eating independently.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the table before a tasty lunch sitting, he agrees resignedly to let help with food.</seg>
<seg id="12">Courageously he succeeds in smiling even and in speaking with the strangers who are occupied round him, to him his drugs bring, and offer him a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the usual death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is my biggest wish that one cures my failure, because this is mortifying", he informs.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some hours later the team has found a remedy for this evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our life we find out that a man pees in the standing position", tells Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the home Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the childhood phase is to be returned for certain people an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This depends on the ability of the person" to accept a backward step, he finds out.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since in the opinion of several people who work in the Palliativpflege big events take place in the midst of these backward steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients who are sent in the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois suffer everybody from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">In this stage they are not showered by the doctors and nurses who look after them any more with so-called "curative" care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear, "is to be died consciously and by suffocation".</seg>
<seg id="24">But by the illness I have really got to know my children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children", she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have no more wishes in the life", she says, before she accepts that one puts on her one mask which helps her in the breathing.</seg>
<seg id="27">She expects during the next days, nevertheless, still the last visit of her son who comes from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the home Victor-Gadbois one offers with a group of voluntary personal care and assistance with the absorption of nutrients.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Palliativpflege is used when there are no other more possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="30">To form the death more pleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec a bed comes on 11,700 inhabitants for the Palliativpflege.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is very little if one considers that we will die one day everybody.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here the life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">At level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">One grants an oral hygiene with brandy or Pepsi to the dying as desired.</seg>
<seg id="36">The diabetics must not control her blood sugar level any more.</seg>
<seg id="37">And the death is a part of the everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Last night we have served Mr. X a beer who has died in the course of the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning his son will drink up the beer at feet of the dead.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help member and patients equally", reports nursing manager Nathalie Savard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">At the home Victor-Gadbois no day is like the other.</seg>
<seg id="42">Beside an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his pillows, while one stumbles to his honour, a young man dies of 36 years who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his both small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"Since six months from three to five beds are always booked with cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years", informs Dr. Christiane Martel uneasy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patients sent in the home Victor-Gadbois come from her dwelling, 47% come from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of the access to the Palliativpflege</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">One says that 77% of the Canadians have no access to the Palliativpflege, i.e. to a care which should relieve the suffering of patients if latter the final stage of her life have reached, at home, in the hospital or at a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organisations, how the home Victor-Gadbois and the society for domestic Palliativpflege in the metropolitan area Montreal specialise more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Exactly this big inadequacy in the health care of Quebec provides for the fact that several doctors specified in the Palliativpflege of the discharge of a law of the regulation of Sterbehilfe and assisted suicide with doubt await.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since the October a manifesto is in the circulation which was signed by prominent personalities of the Palliativpflege like Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to state her contradiction to a such initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to Dr. Christiane Martel the health system of Quebec is not efficient enough to make sure that have all right on a qualitatively high-quality Palliativpflege, before one accepts to go over to the Sterbehilfe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, I have seen a patient who was 14 days with big pains in the provisional accommodation, without one has took measures to her relief.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that the patients want to die because they receive no adequate health care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time several Onkologen treat her patients in spite of the worst forecasts dogged up to the last day.</seg>
<seg id="54">The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimum when she has broken off an unwieldy chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I have informed of my Onkologin that I break off the treatment, she has answered to me that she regrets that I give up the fight, she told.</seg>
<seg id="56">Indeed, she had said me that I am at the end!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No omnipotente care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of the patients, have asked to die, thank the nursing staff that it has not granted to this wish, after her pains have been relieved by a team of the Palliativpflege.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">However, one is clearly said that the Palliativpflege are not with the pain treatment omnipotent.</seg>
<seg id="60">After Elsie Monereau, leader of the Palliativpflege of the society of the domestic Palliativpflege of the metropolitan area Montreal 8% of the patients do not respond to a pain treatment.</seg>
<seg id="61">Completely at the end of the life the doctors fall back therefore often on the appointment ale sedation which runs out to put to sleep the patient either sporadically or permanently up to the time of his death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We can act no longer in such a way, as if we do not perceive this side of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Patients without pain relief will have more and more often the possibility to fall back on this appointment ale sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">The patients whose pains are not relieved say everybody the same sentence: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But this does not mean necessarily, "I want that you put to sleep me", but "I would want that my pains are relieved".</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Real estate scandals of big magnitude in Quebec</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Employ of the road construction office, enterprises of the construction head trade, Geldbeschaffer of political parties and specialist of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a wonderful "system" in which building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are involved.</seg>
<seg id="3">An "industry" which was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, in particular in the 1990s and 2000s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"It is strange as the system disintegrates, since one has took drastic measures", Jacques Duchesneau, representative jokes in Quebec and former leader of the police of Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The scandal was uncovered by him on account of a detailed investigation of the misappropriation in connection with the contracts to road construction works in Quebec to which the prime minister at that time had agreed only with reluctance.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Duchesneau report" set up a direct connection between industry, confidential financing of parties and bribery of officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010", he stresses, "the traffic ministry would have saved alone one milliard dollars in the contracts", because, besides, some reined her instinct to receive her portion!</seg>
<seg id="8">The Charbonneau commission "has already brought two mayors to case", he adds, in hope that she succeeds "in indicating the tactics behind the individuals".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A permanent anti-corruption unity brought to life in 2011</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The permanent anti-corruption unity brought to life in 2011 makes with her troops in chartered accountants, investigating and analysts of the government also big efforts.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, the policemen of the "Marteau troop" which has caused since 2009 that the "canalisation cartel" of Montreal goes forward with the artificial inflation of the contracts reserved...</seg>
<seg id="12">During the last weeks she has carried out by the dozen house searches and has raised accusations because of deception and corruption against municipal mandate holders like Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt who has withdrawn just from his office as a mayor of Laval, the third-biggest town of Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is suspected, in the exchange for public orders repeats bribes to have accepted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Expressly, by the way, engineers of the road construction office were accused by Montreal, as well as enterpriser of Italian origin, how Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter has caused sensation, while he has explained the functionality of the "system" of the preservation of public orders to the commission.</seg>
<seg id="17">He himself has paid during several years 3% of the value of the contracts preserved in Montreal to one with the mafia in connection standing mediator who transferred the money to the union to Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Zambito has had in the 2000s everywhere his hand in the play, while he gave more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approx. 68,000 euros) in provincial parties, above all to the liberals former in power at that time.</seg>
<seg id="19">He also confessed to have organised an unlawful middle procurement for the former liberal vice president Nathalie Normandeau.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The canalisation contracts whose costs were blown up by him artificially</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal the "system" of the corruption functioned smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="22">The former structural engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this before the commission in detail: in ten years he received from the building contractor presents, invitations for travelling, golf tournaments, restaurants and hockey plays, as well as bribes at the rate of 736,000 dollars as a consideration for the canalisation contracts whose costs he blew up artificially.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials of the road construction office have admitted that they can be smeared, while they blew up the calculations with wrong additional achievements artificially about 30-40%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreover, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay has accused that he has seen intentionally over a shadow household which filled his cashes with black money.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of these exposures Mr. Tremblay Anfang November has withdrawn what overthrew Montreal in a heavy crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was one of the first representatives of Montreal whom alarm hit.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a mayoress of the town district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled from 2010 against the sales of a local property that was acquired for 5 million dollars and was resold for 1.6 millions to developer in the booming property market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% of black money in the electoral campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">From the investigation which is carried out at last she says that it moves "in a thread which enables to understand the functionality of the system infiltrated by ants to stop the evil and to denounce the culprits".</seg>
<seg id="30">She says that the procedure is "painfully, but positively".</seg>
<seg id="31">We are about to clean the wound, however, would need an inquiry unity only certain for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent a return of the questionable methods.</seg>
<seg id="32">How one cleans.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regularly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau marks on his part that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", however, comes along before all thought about the role of the "mandate holders who are about the tactics in the picture" if they were not involved in the deception!</seg>
<seg id="35">Outgoing from a portion of 70% of black money by the financing of the electoral campaigns in Quebec he jokes: "To Me was said that this is only a weak imitation of the reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The government of Quebec suggests limiting the donations in parties to 100 dollars what would change according to him nothing in the situation: "As long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in the politics in the circulation."</seg>
<seg id="37">He recommends a complete reworking of the system of the assignment of public orders and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; while we go for the things with courage on the reason, we can rebuild the house on a more respectable base with more controls and laws."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story damages the international respect of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau requests those which laugh to have a look in her own backyard...</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season you have accepted with PSG a new magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">One can explain him by a personal examination, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wonderful players have come.</seg>
<seg id="6">Daily I make on her side progress.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff has also given me a lot.</seg>
<seg id="8">These elements urge me every single day to improve my play level.</seg>
<seg id="9">And with a play this is even easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the football everything goes very fast.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not break out in enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory education of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time with Saint-Etienne I have made always gradual progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">They make use therefore of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">The new entries of this summer are accustomed to deliver plays to very high levels.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training unity is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to the fact, that a player like I who must offer forehead and wants to give his best.</seg>
<seg id="17">By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot concerning my play position.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele who played on the same position like me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti gives respect to all engineers.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he counts to the best trainers of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He looks back at a rich experience and has won many titles with respectable associations.</seg>
<seg id="24">He had contact with big players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that he wins other titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I have carried on a reassuring conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time I had recovered just from an injury series.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust which he has put in me is also an explanation of my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Ligue 1 Lyons has taken to us a seat of the front runner.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, we lurk in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our most important aims is the Champions League: we have qualified in this manner for the round of the last sixteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the aim of the association in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to come so far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">Indeed, we will have to have a say against very good European teams our word.</seg>
<seg id="37">First we want to become a first of our group before postage, so that we can deliver the moving game of the round of the last sixteen as a home match.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can a big European association become of the PSG in the short period?</seg>
<seg id="39">He already has the budget for it...</seg>
<seg id="40">To become a big European association, Paris Titel must win and make to himself in the long term a name.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially gives itself of the PSG the means, so that this plan accepts concrete forms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Would it be a big failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1, how was this the case in the last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">This one big disappointment would be natural.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year it really lies to us in the heart to skim this title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season we were thick in it.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to carry off the victory.</seg>
<seg id="48">We have finished the season with a very strong achievement.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have concluded with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ordinarily one should be with 79 points Master...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved a still better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think that this year is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams struggle like Marseille, Lyons or Bordeaux for the title, I think that we have the makings of winning him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media too much expect from the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">In consideration of that what has been invested and the players whom we have it is normal that a lot is expected from us.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accept this completely.</seg>
<seg id="57">If we win, however, with a home match against Troyes 4-0, and one still finds something of what one can accuse us, is a little bit frustrating with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="58">One asks himself what the people still expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We could never win any week-end with 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We try to put up a play draught.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team is based with the time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League we have proved strength.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester city, an association since two seasons does not get to qualify for the round of the last sixteen, and the also gigantic issues has effected!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the invested sums one believed you to the play break with 15 points projection!</seg>
<seg id="66">This would be called that our opponents and the French mastery would be disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyons and Marseille which were not good in the last season became from this new PSG "geboostet".</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 are exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we will be the smiling winner in the May and say ourselves that we have won them in spite of all difficulties, finally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems to be dependent completely on the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">So much the better that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependence".</seg>
<seg id="72">That is the fact that Ibrahimovic is highly competitive and scores many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">Therefore, he has come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere where he has played, he has made clear that he is a wonderful player and a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the team we respect the player as well as the person.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respects the people who surround him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has performed, is really unusual.</seg>
<seg id="78">This urges the other to improve her play level.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva who is worldwide one of the best defenders also allows it to all other to make progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How have you experienced the EM 2012 with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">How a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">It lay to me in the heart to take part in these EM.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury has stopped me from knocking out some playing time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I have seen there things from which I have arisen strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today I succeed in realising good plays in the national team.</seg>
<seg id="86">This was since my baptism with the "blue" my hope.</seg>
<seg id="87">From that what has occurred in the Ukraine we have pulled our apprenticeship, and today we must display an exemplary behaviour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Which opinion do you have by the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "blue"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He has reached promising results.</seg>
<seg id="90">We have a good position in the qualification group for the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="91">The national trainer is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">How it was also Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would like to draw no comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had achieved his aim, while he had qualified us for the EM.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue" to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Does the draw enforced on the 16th of October in Spain (1:1) show a prelude play?</seg>
<seg id="97">This play has given us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Everybody has exerted itself for all the others.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before this meeting in Spain I have never experienced a comparable play in my career.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">With Bitcoin payment and selling is possible without bank</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The opposite of the topical monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and handling charges between the partners.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, a political vision is handy like so often in these technologies: the conviction that the topical currency system formed by bank monopolies, to financial crises leads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Indeed the Bitcoin fictitious by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym) is a virtual currency (however, in dollar, euro etc. convertibly) as well as a protocol for the sure exchange like BitTorrent which allows the direct exchange of files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With 15,000 computers on the network about 200,000 transactions were already grasped.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a currency.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the course from Bitcoin had reached a highest level of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June, 2011, he fell five months later on 2 dollars, before he has recovered today on about ten dollars (the courses are performed on the web page bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to world trade of real currencies or finance products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The European central bank (EZB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies has still shown interest for this.</seg>
<seg id="10">She describes Bitcoin as the "virtual currency with the biggest success", "in the competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the customary currencies".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies like the "Credits" which are used to make headway in a video game which win one by plays or shop (and sometimes also zurücktauschen) is able.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also developed a such system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Indeed, trade is controlled every time by a central authority and is worked on.</seg>
<seg id="14">With Bitcoin all net knots are at the same time keepers of the calculation book, examiners, monetary emitter as well as buyers and shop assistants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network function?</seg>
<seg id="16">Every transaction between two users takes place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the difference that the user can choose another address for every payment what guarantees the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A row with this transaction in connection to standing data is signed electronically by a double encoding system.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this manner the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">With the help of the contents of the file it is also possible to make sure that the traded Bitcoins exist in the calculation book widespread on the whole network of the public accounts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The determining step consists in putting down this new transaction on this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This happens about a mathematical job which is begun on the computers and the winner, one kind of temporary central banker is, the privilege owns to add this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It concerns dividing the file, i.e. the change of a big file in a shorter and unequivocal electronic fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computers "take" the new transaction and add her one number, before the whole is "chopped".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim is to find that number which proves a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">If this number was found, the other knots can easily check whether it is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is tied together therefore permanently with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user wants to pay for the deception twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of both transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without linking, because both different fingerprints own.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer which has solved the job receives 50 Bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the prevention of an inflation this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Bitcoins located in the circulation are limited therefore to 21 millions, but are divisible up to one 100 millionth part what leaves a certain elbowroom...</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, the difficulty of the job is raised with every improvement of the arithmetic achievement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network has already had heights and depths.</seg>
<seg id="34">The web pages which provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin inserts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The used weak spot does not concern the real protocol", assures Pierre Noizat who has introduced just Paymium which is an enterprise for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The EZB also reports about the possibilities of the money-laundering with the help of this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">Indeed, cash also shows to these defects.</seg>
<seg id="38">Important actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="39">They are accepted by other like the Blog platform WordPress.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann-institute in Israel has analysed the calculation book and has shown that nearly 80% of the Bitcoins are not in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November "mega final sales" were begun.</seg>
<seg id="42">"30,000 dollars were exchanged", is glad Jon Holmquist who works for the enterprise of Coinabul, the Bitcoins into gold converts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat who is also an author of a book about this currency firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a payment without contact with a mobile phone, however, is of use Bitcoin for the Validierung of the transactions which are thereby cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, the owner administers his identity and can remain therefore anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system can be implemented with the traders easily, and latter must instal no new terminals or computer programs.</seg>
<seg id="47">They must give just an address which takes photos from a phone "and are recognised" is able, Pierre Noizat brags who assures that he has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">A general trend with which hierarchical systems are roofed in favour of stronger horizontally straightened systems is to be registered.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Some time will last, until Bitcoin asserts itself, but in 2013 a turning point could be", he forecasts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The EZB plans in her report, by the way to revalue the different, today as highly respected risks in case of a success of this currency.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">We have departed from Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2">And afterwards?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">French troops have left her area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).</seg>
<seg id="4">NATO and the USA might follow in the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is in the time that the Afghan army takes the possession of her territory again, and that the Afghan population decides her future without expecting everything of us.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have punished in particular the Afghan farmers, while we have looked at them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And to ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured persons and disabled persons.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban exist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from the farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, how at the moment of the Soviets.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to defend her ancient and archaic traditions, even if to them Dschihadisten, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek and Tajik have joined.</seg>
<seg id="10">Tolerated, sometimes from the local insurgents supported, latter will not be there any more if the western countries become more discreet.</seg>
<seg id="11">The deduction of the French troops of the base in Nijrab which I have observed from a hill planted with almond trees which was financed with the help of French loans occurred properly.</seg>
<seg id="12">The truck convoys flown by helicopters and armoured convoys have reached Kabul without being attacked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">From the end of 2014 there will be no more streaming of the Taliban in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since her irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996 the conditions have changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">At that time Kabul was empty and the country on account of the fights of the different riotous groups was covered by the war.</seg>
<seg id="16">At that time their seizure of power was looked as a sort of freeing and return to the security.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Afghan women have paid the price of the Obskurantismus of the farmers beaten by the organisation al-Qaeda, but her situation has not improved till this day.</seg>
<seg id="18">Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and topical Taliban have the common wish to hold the women in a subordinated position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war have come into power in 2001 again.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have changed into profiteer, while they have confiscated properties of the government to sell them as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus derived benefit from the massive American assignment of untermissions.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have brought themselves in discredit, and most from them were not involved even in the fights.</seg>
<seg id="22">How I have heard it in the campaigns, the people wish a government which does not consist of thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those which could make the American allowances benefit to themselves: the flight of capital is substantial.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The young people are fed up with the war and with his ideologies.</seg>
<seg id="25">During her exile in Iran or Pakistan they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed their advantages.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 65% of the population is less than 25 years; now Kabul has 5 million inhabitants what is one fifth of the whole population.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the towns the state schools are completely from girl like boys.</seg>
<seg id="28">One will have to make available to these young people who want to return neither to the Obskurantismus of the former parties nor to the corruption of certain executives jobs.</seg>
<seg id="29">Everybody, also the armed parties, is owned by mobile phones; the television with his Turkish series which show a modern world is looked everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Now an army exists.</seg>
<seg id="31">Are the authorities under whose authority she will stand looked as legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight already take care of the restoration of the militia in the province which will avoid the power of the central government.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have profited from a certain decentralisation at the example of the western nations, but by abolition of the office of the Prime Minister which existed since the constitution of 1964 the USA from him wanted to make a centralised state with a strong presidential power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzaï wants no foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the elections planned for April, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">Indeed, his country is dependent since the 50s and already long before on foreign help.</seg>
<seg id="36">Industries were not rebuilt, functioning control works do not exist and important irrigation system were not repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.</seg>
<seg id="38">The pas is given to the private initiative.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country which was ruined from 30-year war a state control of the infrastructures would have been necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The rumour was spread that Afghanistan would own immense mineral resources.</seg>
<seg id="41">This still strengthens the impression that the western countries were only on site to seize of that.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without energy to process the iron ore or copper ore on site, or without means of transportation for an export over the mountains no mining is possible.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, the international archeologists (financed from the world bank) on the gigantic Buddhist site allow to make her excavations and remain the most important employers of the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">One day it will be also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan on which extensively the imports and exportations are dependent again produce normal relations.</seg>

<seg id="45">The deduction of the French fight troops was concluded on the 20th of November.</seg>
<seg id="46">The new co-operative agreement intends the continuation of traditional aid: Girl's high schools and young high schools, institute of French at the universities, French institute, cooperation in the military, juridical, medical and agricultural area, support of the archaeological delegation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Since 2009 a service "of civil-military actions" of the ministry of defence (Cimic) which was put in 2012 in dozens of mountain villages has carried out numerous charitable works and measures for the renovation of the agriculture and from a small French non-governmental organisation allow to carry out to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to reach the impossible job of the compatibility from aid and offensive actions.</seg>
<seg id="48">These works for which numerous local manpower was necessary could serve to suppress the uprising: Irrigation, well, drinking water, rereforestation, fruit-trees, soil conservation and rise of the agricultural usable areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Which souvenir do we leave behind after military expenses of two milliard euros?</seg>
<seg id="50">A lot of more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of the local living conditions which are very hard in this often at a height of more than 2000 metres of recumbent valleys.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the message dozens written inquiries have come smaller of agricultural plans of municipalities of the province of Kapisa.</seg>
<seg id="52">So that the farmers of the uprising controlled by foreign groups escape what is her wish after her own statements, the continuation would be lower, well more controlled and they was necessary directly of concerning civil aid in your favour.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It concerns a new poker play of president Mohammed Mursi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains split concerning the constitutional explanation which grants temporarily the unrestricted authority to him more than ever, he has decided to put everything on a map.</seg>
<seg id="4">To the surprise all he has announced on Wednesday that the constitutional-giving meeting dismisses the next day his final version.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just one week ago the head of state had granted to this plenary sitting two additional months for the end of his works.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Now Egypt rests for nearly two years on a temporary, several times changed text what weakens the institutional stability and leads to a juridical mess.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has provided only for an even stronger splitting of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For his opponents the president pauses in his "autocratic delirium", while he breaks furthermore "his word" and "the right with feet steps".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the part of his advocates one assures that it is a way to finish the institutional and political crisis as fast as possible and to accelerate the transitional process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within 14 days a referendum should be held.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period which makes the brothers renounce her plan explain the text Segment for segment to the Egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president it is also to be found again a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest raves in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="13">After affirmations during an interview with the American weekly show time Mohammed Mursi seems to be persuaded of the fact that the Egyptians will be right favorably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Particularly as an ultimatum is issued to the Egyptian people with this falling back on a hasty vote: "Either you are right for my draught, or I keep the unrestricted authority", an end should take after acceptance of the constitution putatively the latter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">85 mainly Islamic members of this constitutional-giving meeting have dismissed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the liberals has not followed to the request.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly before the constitutional explanation at the middle of November they have turned away, because they believe that they have not been able to bring to bear her perceptions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of organisations of human rights, religious minorities or the civil society have equally acted.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the reaching of the quorum 11 people, acting members, were added yesterday morning in all haste.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are close to the Muslim's brothers very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not astonishing that the articles were dismissed usually unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">The annotators found, by the way, entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... has been expressed in the time for the prayer, because some members of the committee believed that the pendulum clock of the constitutional-giving meeting exactly did not go.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text which has still been dismissed last night exists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">The article 2 which attracted all attention to itself remains, finally, identically with that of the constitution of 1971 and says that "the principles of the sharia are the main spring of the right".</seg>
<seg id="25">The salafistischen parties for which the establishment of the Islamic right is an important demand had hope to substitute "for the principles" with the "rules" what would have made a stricter use possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the islamists is the fact that this article was not changed, a proof of her good will and of her respect towards the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">The liberals who look at this only as a propaganda blow answer "sanctimony".</seg>
<seg id="28">Since according to them the islamization of the constitution about other articles occurs.</seg>
<seg id="29">Besides, they have particularly the article 220 in the eye which awards an advisory function to the university of Al-Azhar in particular concerning the examination of the conformance with the laws of the sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier this is disconcerting, because "the people who are requested to a statement have not been chosen and own no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">One can see in this the first signs of a Theokratie".</seg>
<seg id="32">Moreover, the fears of the liberals are fed by the fact that the next rector of this university might be by far less temperate than the current one.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Currently no concrete religious engagement is to be recognised.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution we remain within the scope of the middle-class state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most lawyers who have worked on this text are no Ulema, but graduates who have been trained partly in the French system", appeases Alexis Blouet who writes a doctoral thesis about the Egyptian Verfassungstransition.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, he puts away, "that concerning the article 220 an ambiguity can be given, because the used concepts are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic administration of justice, Ed.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in future the question could be raised, to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Beside his religious aspect the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised on account of the far-reaching competence which he grants to the president of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim's brothers argue that these are clearly reduced compared to the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another contentious issue: the competence of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the harmony with the wish of the military the check of the defensive household is presented not to the parliament, but a national defensive advice.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also there will be no ban of civil procedure in military courts how it the unions have demanded in the defence of the human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also inform of her fears concerning the text at which they look as freedom-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact of the matter of the blasphemy will maintain, and now insults are forbidden what could have serious results for the right on freedom of speech, in particular for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, no more article refers to the protection of the women, Heba Morayef of Humanly Rights Watch underlines.</seg>
<seg id="47">In your opinion the only positive point is the ban of the torture by article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not included in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president had to express himself last night on television, demonstrations are planned for today afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The advocates of the head of state will deploy Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea from sole</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The promised land unites the magnificence of biblical truth, modern comfort and an untouched nature in itself.</seg>
<seg id="3">AIF calls to you five most important reasons for a visit in Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Before the holy sites bow</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Visit the river Jordan in which Jesus was christened.</seg>
<seg id="6">It means that everybody who have a bath in this river receives God's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Galilee is the place at which Jesus accomplished his miracles: the change of water in wine on a wedding celebration, the walking on the water, the Stillung of the sea storm and the fishing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, most sanctums are found in Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="10">Believers commit here the suffering way or crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).</seg>
<seg id="11">The way begins with the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old Town to the grave church on the mountain Golgotha where the crucifixion place, the Salbungsstein and the grave of Jesus are.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here is in Christian view the navel of the world which symbolises the rescue of the humanity.</seg>
<seg id="13">The cloister of the holy cross in Jerusalem stands at the place at which according to a Christian legend the tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Jerusalem is also the holiest place of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple which was destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 A.D.</seg>

<seg id="18">They lie with a cliff face in the mountains at 450-metre height about the sea level.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only mountaineers can reach the ruins from own strength.</seg>
<seg id="20">An aerial cable railway brings all the others to this historical summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In the north of the country at from 1600-to 2040-metre height there is the famous skiing area Hermon in which it pulls countless tourists during the winter months.</seg>
<seg id="22">From the foot of the mountain you reach there by a shuttle coach.</seg>
<seg id="23">The ski runways have a total length of 45 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to an old legend pagan gods at the mountaintop lived supposedly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Unique museums visit</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In this country there are nearly 300 museums.</seg>
<seg id="27">With only one trip not everybody can be visited of it.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, at least five most interesting from them a visit should be paid.</seg>
<seg id="29">Under it the Israel museum is once not far from the Knesseth (parliament).</seg>
<seg id="30">There old Qumranhandschriften or scrolls are kept by the dead sea which were found in rock caves in the Judäischen desert as well as about 500 000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Also the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is worth a visit.</seg>
<seg id="32">There the collection is issued by works of the impressionists and expressionist Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.</seg>

<seg id="36">The entry is free, and donations are basically rejected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, told by one of the most stupefying chapters of the history.</seg>
<seg id="38">The most affecting department is the monument for the children which was built to the memory of the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.</seg>
<seg id="39">With the entrance of the space there rules complete darkness.</seg>
<seg id="40">Stars sparkle.</seg>
<seg id="41">And there sound the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also the Ukraine is mentioned there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Something for the health do</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Three most important recreation areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the dead sea.</seg>
<seg id="45">At each of three places there are swimming-pools, water parks, dolphin arias and ocean arias.</seg>
<seg id="46">Surprisingly it is bathed in the Red Sea also during the winter months, because the water temperature does not fall there under 21 °C and the air warms itself up to 23 °C.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The dead sea is even warmer and there it is bathed all year round.</seg>
<seg id="48">By the way, this unusual sea with a situation of 417 metres under the sea level is the most deeply situated sea of the world.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"Big and mighty" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While representatives and civil rights campaigners discuss it of which use the law about obliging linguistic tests is for migrants, criminals already act with phoney certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Yearly 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other towns of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most from them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only aim is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remained in the native country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On the 1st of December a law came into force which according to every working migrant certifies a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, must put away.</seg>
<seg id="7">Up to now this regulation is valid only for the migrant who want to work in the service industry, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the tests should become with the time according to federal migration authority in future for all foreign workers the duty.</seg>
<seg id="9">Besides, one must file not only linguistic tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the bases of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Linguistic proficiency must be proved for the preservation as well as the lengthening of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exceptions are valid only for citizen of countries in which Russian is an official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Are also excluded from this law people who have received her education reports and certificates before the decay of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Sense, problems and protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The totality of the exam places will stand under the aegis of the Pushkin's institute of the Russian language, the Russian university of the friendship between nations, the Moscow state university, the Petersburg state university and other Russian colleges.</seg>
<seg id="15">The migrants can file the tests in all towns; by now were opened in Russia already more than 160 suitable centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the representatives of the state Duma and the federal migration authority.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, civil rights campaigners put before the introduction of the law in the press several times the following question: What does the whole bring, actually?</seg>
<seg id="18">Which changes make does the regulation have to show linguistic proficiency, for the Russians as well as for the foreign workers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all, speakers of the migration authority reply, it is a matter of reducing the number of the forced laborers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Now many talk about the protection of the rights of working migrants", says the leader of the representation of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, their rights must be already protected against her departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only one organised recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.</seg>
<seg id="23">Migrants bump into problems without occupation, education, linguistic proficiency and medical investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Sebelew is persuaded of the fact that a future migrant without linguistic proficiency will meet necessarily person with bad intentions which put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow barrack where he will endure with dozens his equals months without food and documents and from 12 to 14 hours on the day slave.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">A lot of discomfort reaches us from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In the native country one is promised to you, and on arrival you are cheated, her passports taken agree and do not receive the promised wage", confirms the leader of the head office for working migration of the tadschikischen migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do not get angry, boss!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Still admit many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn her money in Russia, that they not only cannot control the language of the aim country, but express themselves also into her own language hardly in writing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course this is not so much her guilt, when rather the evil: Only few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford just one reasonable basic school education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since in her families there is not money yet to nourish the children, never mind, to buy to them decent clothes, shoes and school things.</seg>
<seg id="31">Then as teenagers these children take straight away the first opportunity to the moneymaking.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It is difficult without linguistic proficiency", they admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel degraded and inferiorly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Civil rights campaigners stress the following important aspect with regard to the law.</seg>
<seg id="35">Only migrants with legal status must file the test.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you do not have this status, there is no check and consequently no official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile the large part of the foreign workers stays furthermore illegally in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Pretty welcome "or" admission for unauthorized forbade"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to receive an official status in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason are bureaucratic hurdles and of course the linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Moreover, the legalisation costs money: From 12 to 16 000 roubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">One can make a phoney registration fast and merely for One and a half 000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mainly faked and are not registered us, and then from it there originate cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"You want hundred or 200 roubles for cigarettes and tea", the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow expresses himself towards journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Only no costs for wrong papers shy"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Already on the day in which the law came into force turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be faked.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some phoney certificates which certify the Absolvierung of the linguistic test already became from employees of the federal migration authority beschlaggenommen.</seg>
<seg id="48">The phoney papers were printed with a usual colour printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course the new owners did not receive this free of charge: Every migrant who hoped to be able to save himself thus the tests paid 7000 roubles for the document.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is more than twice as much like the costs for the official test: This costs a working migrant to 3000 roubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Office-bearers as well as civil rights campaigners agree about the fact that the most important immediate job consists in it to protect the system against corruption so that the certificates cannot be simply bought.</seg>
<seg id="52">For the moment the authorities can promise to the foreign workers who fall the first time by the test only that they receive time for a linguistic reason course.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition, places are offered to newcomers without linguistic proficiency in areas in which no active notification with people is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="7">Not everybody are contented with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight against the problems by "attraction of the screws".</seg>
<seg id="8">On the Internet an open letter was published whose authors - representative of different weapon associations - demand of the authorities to refrain from "pointless increases".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, expressed of the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, to the Russian service of the BBC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes with use of the registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a Total of 1,168 000 offences were registered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are persuaded that an increase of the law will not keep criminals from it for private weapon owners from serving itself on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the moment one can find according to the authors in Moscow every possible weapon for little money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spreading of unlawful weapons is under control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Suppliers: from the factories up to the officers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The weapons reach about several canals the black market.</seg>
<seg id="16">There are five such main canals, tells a former colonel Viktor Baranez who acted ten years in the ministry of education and in the general staff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screenshot of a web page which accepts weapon orders</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first canal is the army or the military, i.e. weapons which were stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers as well as the Caucasians themselves", says Baranez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">On the second canal there come the unlawful weapons which are stolen from representatives of the law by criminals.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranez explains that moreover weapons count which were stolen from the armories of the police as well as directly by employees of the criminal proceedings authorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Other ones illegally sold weapons come from military arms caches.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a lot of military storage it often came to explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There are proofs that it concerned with some cases arson to cover up the absence of weapons", says the former member of the armed forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The weapon manufacturers also make according to Baranez a contribution to the black market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Nowadays there are countless private armament factories who do not stand firm of the international competition and squander, therefore, the weapons under the hand on the black market, possibly in Moscow,", reports the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another canal of the black market is the smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Particularly many guns and guns come from poor countries like Kirghizia.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is own, sometimes craft production as well as a mafia which organises the smuggling", explains the former member of the armed forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where from do the weapons come?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts calculated which portion each of five canals about has in the supply of the black market with unlawful weapons.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2011 a report was written by the centre for problem analyses and state management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The experts analysed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the federal service for state statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on main entrances on the subject Weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The prevailing part of the unlawful weapons comes according to the investigators of the army and the legal protection authorities.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the "guilt of persons responsible, in her work with weapons deal reached", one says in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">To the data of the researchers according to 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% decrease to thefts with the weapon production, and 5% come from unlawful excavations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">A sales consultant of a weapon store who does not want to be called notable assures that the weapons which are found with unlawful excavations for a long time nobody more shops, because they have become outdated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">According to him it is more frequent that traders get themselves the supplies in an arms cache.</seg>
<seg id="39">About an officer cadet a weapon, for example, a gun is bought from the type TT.</seg>
<seg id="40">The weapon is issued and handed over by the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The trader brings the weapon in the town and sells them there for 900 euros each with two magazines", he tells</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The police knows of course about all answer and, therefore, leads if it cannot keep to the plan to the disclosure of crime, the sales consultant adds periodically controlling purchases with the traders by who offer unlawful weapons".</seg>

<seg id="46">I found out the price of the weapon only there</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"To procure a weapon, I need a friend, the contacts has", tells the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I do not trust him".</seg>
<seg id="49">There is trader at the markets, however, there one must go and arrange to meet a code like "from Iwan Iwanowitsch which allows to aim that the daughter has lost a tooth".</seg>
<seg id="50">I come currently even to some blow rings about a friend whom I trust.</seg>
<seg id="51">He delivers the blow rings also to me because he knows that I do not blab on him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Novices look for weapons on different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former member of the armed forces Viktor Baranez tried middle of the 1990th weapons unlawful as a buyer when he wrote an article on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="54">The pattern have not changed according to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He got a photo album in which "all possible" was illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt like in the luxury store", remembers the member of the armed forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer gets according to Baranez not the cat in the bag, but can try out everything.</seg>
<seg id="58">I as a potential customer shop not just, but go with the shop assistant in the wood, and there we put up a target.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Then I can shoot there, and if I am persuaded of the fact that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other", the expert describes the action.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In the USA strike fast-food employee and supermarket employee</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every fourth US-American youngster sits sometime behind the cash of Mc Donald's</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Everywhere during the past days it came in the USA to massive protests against low wages to branches of hipped kind and restaurants of popular fast-food chains like Mc Donald's, Burger King, taco Barking, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Still nobody can predict whether the protests rise even further or whether the air soon goes out to them again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing charitable organisations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Beside the rise of the modest wages of easy hipped kind employees and fast-food employees the organizers of the protests pursue the aim to found trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Up to now this branch of the economy is hardly organised union.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents in the year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began the last week after Thanksgiving, in the so-called Black Friday in which in the USA sellouts took place which attracted millions of customers what led now and again to brawls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day laid down some hipped kind employees from whom there are worldwide 2.2 millions, her work and were on strike together with trade unions and left activists against branches of the chain whose target group of people of low and middle income are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Hipped kind sells all products, from nappies through hunting guns and autobatteries up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The product in the hipped kind branches is more favorable on an average between 8 and 27% than in big supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, many of the slightly paid-up hipped kind employee make purchases only in own job.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prices and the line of goods made hipped kind one of the biggest enterprises in the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics hipped kind can sell the product often so favourably because the employees are badly paid.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain about heavy terms of employment, for example, missing forklifts or hand scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the protests in "Black Friday" demanded pay raises and expressed her annoyance about the fact that the contribution had risen for the in-house health insurance of from 30 to 100 dollars in the month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical hipped kind employee who earns 9.5 US dollars the hour cannot afford this rise, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Researchers from the Californian university in Berkeley prove that if the enterprise raises the average wage on 12 dollars the hour it would cost hipped kind 3,2 Milliards dollars.</seg>
<seg id="20">These are approx. 1.1% more than they now for wage make a donation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If hipped kind put down the pay raises completely on the customers, every purchase cost them in future to only 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">Per year would be for them in comparison to Mehrausgaben today of only 12.39 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Advocates of hipped kind find out contently that it came only to nine federal states to protests and these gave no losses to the enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Black Friday lasted in his store of 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday to midnight the next day, and in this period sold hipped kind about 5000 articles per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">All together the hipped kind cashes in "Black Friday" explained nearly 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The speaker of the enterprise, Dan Fogelman, stated during an interview on the web page of the left-wing Huffington post that all together "less than five" hipped kind employees laid down the work and the protest action merely "another PR trick" of the trade union which organised the protests, has been.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free cash!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests went on this week in New York where her aim, nevertheless, the hipped kind branches (which are not welcome in this advanced town and are up to now inexistent, therefore) but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants were not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says, the enterprise sells milliards servings, and, nevertheless, one grants to you no sick person's days, and you are not paid for your honest work!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane William, member of the New York town council</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently the minimum wage lies according to federal and New York legislation with 7.25 dollars the hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fast-food restaurants the minimum wage is raised bit by bit, indeed, not too strongly, and on average her easy employees get 8.90 US dollars the hour in New York.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less than they nobody earns in this expensive town.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How it is possible to get by in New York with so little money, is incomprehensible to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was once a time in which nearly one quarter of all US-American youngsters stood after the school in McDonald's behind the bar, indeed, the youngsters still lived with her parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">None saw in it the main source of income or planned to remain longer there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that they must get by with this wage and nourish her children sometimes even.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, there is in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal a comment whose author marks, it is irresponsible to get children if one does not know how one should nourish them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protests who began Street and in Madison avenue on Thursday at 6.30 o'clock in the morning before McDonald's in the 40Th demanded that the cashiers and cooks from fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars the hour what corresponds more than one duplication of the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They demanded furthermore the education of trade unions in the fast-food branch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The US-American law forbids to the enterprise guidance to stand to this aim in the way and to caution trade union members or to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the enterprise guidance makes it to them not easy.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, the foundation of trade unions in the fast-food branch is also difficult for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Discontented one</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">There were loud protests on this day also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The climax of the protests was a meeting at the midday before McDonald's in the Times Square in which some local democrats spoke, under it town councillor Jumaane William who said: "McDonald's says, it sells milliards servings, and, nevertheless, one grants to you no sick person's days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, mayor's candidate Bill De Blasio who said that "we should support together the fast-food employees, so that they receive a fair wage and can reach the economic prosperity which every inhabitant of New York earns!".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">According to New York Times this was the biggest action of her kind in the history of the US-American fast-food industry.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, only some Hundred people were on site by which with wide not everybody are occupied in the fast-food branch in which in New York ten thousands work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Still is not to be seen whether the spark of these protests mobilises whole masses.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The brain can be outwitted up to now only moderately"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The technologies modern with followers popular subject of the enlarged reality are lately perceived for usual by the lens of special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Then first presented Google in summer with his annual conference a functioning model, in November became known that also Microsoft had announced a suitable patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, in the conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D-technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, becomes clear that the glasses were only one stopping-off place for the scientists of the enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="5">She irritates the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual free surfaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Describe please briefly which researches your group pursues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We deal with the interaction of person and machine, besides, want to extend, nevertheless, the borders of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Up to now the humanity has got stuck mainly in the phase in which with pixels on flat panel displays is worked which are sometimes also touched.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and nowadays it is sold no more Xbox without Kinect, because everybody is interested in movement control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What expects us still in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although Kinect has brought the interaction on a physical level, a lot still happens on the flat panel display, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The input of information (the system receives more data) could not be improved, the issue up to now yet decisively.</seg>
<seg id="14">We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional representation systems on the basis of different technologies, under it projections.</seg>
<seg id="15">We must dismiss the computer world in our physical world and make them more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, in addition it is necessary that not only the user, but also his surroundings is recognised.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.</seg>
<seg id="18">And first of all we should get rid of these goofy Virtual Reality helmets!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about linguistic control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is liked, but is it not overrated?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- It is not certainly the universal solution, because it raises questions to the privacy because one would not always like to inform all bystanders about his actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Actually, every kind of interaction is good with computers, indeed, everybody in her certain niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, we worked in the area of the control of objects on public places on a project with which we experimented with short and scanty, instead of with very wide gestures.</seg>
<seg id="24">Besides, the gestures were taped not by the object camera, but by a bracelet which registered the movements of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">Still it is relatively big, could be reduced theoretically, nevertheless, on the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But, however, all together the future belongs to mixed control types, for example, gesture and language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- We would ask you me, for example to pass to you this mineral water tin?</seg>
<seg id="29">They say it and indicate at the same time at it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Ordinarily I say it just.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, this would be very difficult to recognise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- Is this called, you want that the user adapts himself to this what can perform a machine at the respective time and what not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">-, but it is not necessarily here about a mutual approach.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that we must become work in the next time above all on the development of new sensor types which enable to grasp reactions of people more exactly.</seg>
<seg id="35">These can be, for example, laser sensors, because they offer a good resolution in the depth what is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- Which demands do you make outgoing from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Is there not enough resolution, depth or something else other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of the three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course 8 Megapixel would not be bad at a speed of 1000 fps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the central issue are not the mega pixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus all present technologies are not seen for us well enough, because the developers of the algorithms have more job.</seg>
<seg id="42">It must be considered not only the resolution along the X-and the Y-, but also along the Z axis.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the speed and the number of the pictures per second are important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The movements of the person are extremely dynamic and to tell the truth, the current 30 fps are in particular for gestures not enough.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a touch sensor with a regulable processing delay between from 1 to 100 milliseconds and the today's commercial sensors lie closer with the second value (from 60 to 100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not everybody understand, how much this influences the interaction of person and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For my work I just needed a device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Would the number of the cameras not have to be raised?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- Presently Kinect works with three "cameras" and one is of it, actually, an infrared transmitter and the second one a receiver for the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is really a usual RGB camera.</seg>
<seg id="51">She does not serve for the calculation of the object depth.</seg>
<seg id="52">More cameras could possibly solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or strengthen the problem, because more calculations would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">Would be nice an adaptable system Similar to Kinect with which we could play with different camera inclinations to find out how to us helps in the three-dimensional inquiry of a position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I surely remember, Microsoft in contrast to Google did not present his glasses to the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that in view of the use of the technology of the enlarged reality in the everyday life the glasses have the best views?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course it is not pleasant to hold a Smartphone in the upraised hand on the way always, but I think follower: The most great variation would be a "varying" enlarged reality with which we could switch over about a Cloud of the glasses to the Smartphone,</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are a personal Gadget and in it there lies her strength (the Private only you can see), but at the same time also her weakness, because an enlarged reality by means of glasses prevents that you can work together with other on virtual objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- If we imagine a moment long that the manipulation of virtual hologrammes is accessible in the air not only Tony Stark from Iron One, but also normal mortal.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem to which critics of this idea often point: There is no noticeable reaction!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands feel generally nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">Which answers wants your group on this objection to give?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures I often speak of the fact that the enlarged reality shows the seventh breakthrough with the interaction between person and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think, the eighth breakthrough could absolutely become the integration of the tactile perception.</seg>
<seg id="65">An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a little bit unusual projection base.</seg>
<seg id="66">She perceives pressure very well!</seg>
<seg id="67">However, there are also technologies which are aimed really to lend something sturdy to the "pictures in the air", for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays generates in a certain point where the finger is, a feeling which is still so weak at the moment, however as if somebody puffed about the hand bales.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also tapes for the wrist which have an effect on the nervous endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to outwit the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">It allow to think that it feels this what should feel it if it sees just something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- This is a good idea, we have not tried it yet.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here is hidden an other job with which we will still have to fight long, namely a person who is physically in a closed space to let believe he is, instead, in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on draughts with run tapes (other than in fitness studios), movable platforms as well as big balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">Up to now the brain can be outwitted only moderately, and before us still there lie many busy years.</seg>
<seg id="74">Just this makes the work in the area of the virtual reality for a researcher so engaging: With many subjects we stand only at the beginning.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde" which is dedicated to townsmen who form the avant-garde of the art and culture.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the select list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene whose success after the borders of the town goes and finds the often recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The whole town knows Kirill Miller which in Red dressed bearded, one finds sometimes at the Russian museum, sometimes with the summer garden, sometimes at stage meeting or on art openings.</seg>
<seg id="6">Where always the pictures are also issued by Kirill Miller, they attract big human masses.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is one of the typical inhabitants of St. Petersburg social-philosophical artist who create new myths.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the Petersburg avant-garde end of the 80th or beginning of the 90th.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is also a man of the town and conjures by his presence on the street to his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides with them for good mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently he caught to himself a barrel organ and became the Petersburg barrel organ player, because he felt ready for this difficult role in view of his artist's existence, his philosophy and his image, finally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- Kirill, why you are on the move, actually, always in Red and not, for example, in Yellow or turquoise in the town?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">I have chosen the colour Red as a fashion designer who argues with the optics and the image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world the compromise is Red between artists, image advisers and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the society everything causes what soaks off somewhat from the grey norm, aggressions and bad behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, I want to get into conversation by my provocations with the people.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of my past provocations was an invitation for the conversation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">- When did you know that you must become a painter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- With an exhibition in the cultural palace Newskij with which my works were issued.</seg>
<seg id="19">I understood that I must go this way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then at that time the time of the old free came to an end, however, not officially approved painter, and new and free painters like I were incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="21">I made friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from it there originated "Puschkinskaja 10", and then was first of all end.</seg>
<seg id="22">It pulls me to the theatre, to the fashion, to the music, actually, to all, except the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">- And all this joined in your kind clinic... - It was important to me to stand in the centre of the Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should assemble.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995 I took a space in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was up to the renovation works a musical-artistic club for the bohemian world, the house of the Petersburg bohemian world.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also reminds me how string with his project "Ucho van Goga" came there.</seg>
<seg id="26">String and his friends sang easy songs to the Play forecastle, carried narrow tricots and to them the composer Igor Wdowin announced today also belonged.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group started playing live, became from her "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">National costume mountain presented many programmes prematurely from "Halli-Galli".</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them national costume mountain, and it began his big career, but he learnt the bases with us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have her origin in the kind clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">There went our employees and habitués.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, as a culture something else meant.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000 there was in the press a survey by which it was about the honouring "personalities of our town".</seg>
<seg id="34">I won in the category "Artist of the year", and with it I had arrived in the climax.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the today's time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same one: One can be famous without making with it a cultural contribution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- Your works have an unmistakeable style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will have an exhibition with the subject "The Russian museum as clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">Earlier I was social, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be thus.</seg>
<seg id="42">In a clown all that blurs and loses his tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, and I have absurd ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">If we save, for example, the world, while we prescribe that everybody has to disguise itself completely.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now everybody pays attention to the clothes and orientates itself by the appearance and not in the inside of the person.</seg>
<seg id="46">But maybe one may give to a person not the hand, but should spit to him in the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">The deception disappears by dressing up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A cultural town should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, if not I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- Can commercial art be also nice?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, thoughtful and flattering.</seg>
<seg id="52">We see the decay of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Earlier the people formed big groups: Bohemians loved One and easy people the other.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to like all.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am no Einhundert dollar mark which everybody likes.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now you must consider who will like you.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now every cult star has about 100 followers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- However, to the appearances of Stas Michailow several come Thousand!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- To him come desolate women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="60">For cultural reasons there come 300 people and not 10 000, consequently there is less management, money, and everything perishes.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have follower, and the most important is not to cheat them and not to destroy the achieved.</seg>
<seg id="62">In my youth I have painted such pictures which hung with a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.</seg>
<seg id="63">I began with pictures which ordinarily come only at the end of the career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="65">It means: spiritual culture and consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">Consumption has generally no culture, this is something else.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money to be able to paint.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is the culture which I recommend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Kirill what Petersburg is absent?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- Good cultural experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">One says: Servant of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, not each of them can deal with culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">With the real czars it was different, because the czars maybe did not understand a lot from culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="74">Presently in Moscow there are good advisers.</seg>
<seg id="75">In Petersburg we have which, the experts could be, but the way is obstructed to them, because it requires hochrangigerer experts who value the Ersteren properly and free to them the way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now only own taste counts.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same is valid for the Erarta, however, with the difference that they say honestly that they must accept not all contemporary art and search some painters for themselves, therefore, other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">- What is for you Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a suitable fertile soil.</seg>
<seg id="80">On our stones art can grow up only hard.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural fertile soil, because, for example, we have meanwhile more authors than reader, and, nevertheless, this is not right.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">With us are much less.</seg>
<seg id="84">Art must moulder again be, as well as at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is financed from subsidies of the city of Saint Petersburg</seg>

<seg id="1">Birth in the universe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Earth in danger.</seg>
<seg id="3">Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Caravans of spaceships with earthlings come along aboard on the search for a spare planet.</seg>
<seg id="5">To save the humanity, does the important question position itself as we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the spare planet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">There are not many choices in my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">De facto there are only two real planets which we could inhabit at least hypothetically.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Because Mars and Venus", says the scientific employee of the Astronomical star mountain institute Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While, nevertheless, the conditions on Mars are relatively friendly to life, a temperature of 500 degrees rules on the surface of the Venus.</seg>
<seg id="10">Life would be possible only by big height or in the orbit of the Venus, so in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The researchers treated the question of the reproduction in all first in view of the flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already half a century before it experiments with plants were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fourth generation of the peas grown in the orbit differed not in the slightest from the earthly kinds.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Züchtung of insects followed, more exactly from tiny fruit aviation (Drosophila), in the orbit.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979 quail's eggs were sent in the universe to investigate how the weightlessness affects the development of embryos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It develops quite a normal fledgling.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, then the problem begins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem consists in the fact that the fledgling must find hold; it must be able to stand on his legs and start moving", explains the lab leader of the institute of medical-biological problems COME ON, Vladimir Sychew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without firm subsoil the fledglings wildly overturned.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn children completely from.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fledglings did not react to light and sounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Then four days later they simply died.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Twice we let fledgling slip and then put the whole because it is simply impossible to work there with them", Vladimir Sychew sticks to the failed experiment with the fledglings in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last brood cage with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.</seg>
<seg id="25">In spring, 2013 the experiments are continued.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, will be on the biosatellite "Bion" only same-sexual species.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There was an experiment with rats who were already sent fertilised in all.</seg>
<seg id="28">Besides, in principle nothing was ascertained special.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This was just with the biosatellites, but once more it was only one single experiment, and the researches must be continued", notes Vladimir Sychew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After the landing the space rats got younger generation.</seg>
<seg id="31">One could not solve the problems of the reproduction directly in the space up to now.</seg>
<seg id="32">The job is difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The animals who are torn from her natural living space cannot simply follow her reproductive desire.</seg>
<seg id="34">In contrast to animals the person would be able to do this in principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The homo sapiens is able of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, women already fly for 50 years in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">There was the biggest risk with Tereschkowa.</seg>
<seg id="39">The most valuable which owns the humanity is the female organism.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our gull flew away, and nobody on the earth could have answered the following question: Does she get over the space flight?</seg>
<seg id="41">Will she be able to give birth after this flight to a child?</seg>
<seg id="42">"Finally, nobody answered this question", says space ex-serviceman awake seaweed Watschnadse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June, 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, bore a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also a cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988 the second woman bore in all, Swetlana Sawizkaja who was twice in the orbit and did even works beyond the spacecraft, a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevertheless, a risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only extremely few cosmonauts with whom after long flights everything went well and they recover younger generation agreed.</seg>
<seg id="48">"The more, the more dangerously it itself is with flights in the orbit", cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian federation concludes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And, nevertheless, the humanity must look for new ways in the biotechnology, the ray protection and generating artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The Hydrolabor in the preparatory centre of the cosmonauts is a compulsory station during the flight preparation.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in a Schwebezustand the cosmonauts Routine win for the work in the open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water shows the weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Even if adult waters feel as pleasant, these are foreign surroundings; however, babies feel water as a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is as if the small Ichtyander report put away of the fact that the life in the country emerged from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get used then lighter to water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, because from the birth up to the first swimming just once 2 weeks pass.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is not enough a time to forget something", says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">While for a newborn child the weightlessness is a lot of more natural state, the woman gets by not without gravitation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In the state of the weightlessness the belly musculature recedes and pelvic musculature enormously fast and with it also takes the ability to squeeze out the child.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well, we handle by natal-prefatory aid.</seg>
<seg id="61">The birth could take place, for example, also in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.</seg>
<seg id="62">"But what happens then?", is the not unimportant question of Waleri Poljakow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child needs also artificial gravitation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without feeling the earth's pull, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">A newborn child can be put in the orbit not like an adult to the training in a load suit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">He will simply lack this what is for his life of elementary meaning.</seg>
<seg id="67">"This experiment which we carry out together namely the birth of a child in foreign surroundings, will lead to the fact that we will give birth to a disabled person, to a completely non-conformist person", the leader of the bioethical commission of the institute of medical-biological problems forecasts COME ON, Igor Pestow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Up to now the birth of children in the universe is a bare theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">However, sometime it becomes a reality if the earthlings open in her spaceships to a distant planet which becomes the home for theirs in all born descendants.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">NK Ú boss: Control of the black system fails by fault of the politics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Czechia disposes in connection with public orders of good control authorities and adequate laws, nevertheless, falls back in their use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the conversation for Aktuáln ě. cz the vice president of the highest controlling office (Nejvy š š í kontrolní úřad, NK Ú), Miloslav Kala says this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"A law is never perfect, but it must be properly applied - and this is in my opinion with us not the case", Kala comments on the topical situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">To a similar result a common control comes apparently also by Czech and German examiners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As a negative practise example he states the setting of prime minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Did the prime minister recently say that the ODS the enterprisers did not bother with controls - is the system forbidden now or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"Nevertheless, a law must have his validity, and if is forbidden a little bit legally, nevertheless, the government chairperson cannot simply come, and hinder the controlling office whose duty is anyway the control of the observance of the law in his activity", finds out Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the meeting of the controlling committee of the representative's chamber you spoke of a common Czech-German project in whose frame the laws of both countries were compared with regard to public orders with each other.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was it there specifically about?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Besides, it concerns a parallel check with which we have begun about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simplisticly said, it is about the fact that the European legislative powers fix how public orders are to be used. The state legislations are based on it. And, finally, there is still the real practical use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We have compared this everything with each other, and although the check is not concluded yet, we could ascertain extremely interesting differences. In general said, the laws are stricter with us maybe still a little bit "and are more perfect", nevertheless, the real use is better in Germany in some parametres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">With it is confirmed that it is not enough to put up over and over again new and more exact rules. One must also deal with the real use of the right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To what extent the project can be to you a help? What arises for you from this project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just such a common control could contribute to the fact that we stop taking care constantly of a Perfektionierung of the laws and the lowering and Austarierung of threshold values if this affects seemingly not especially positively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economic efficiency means, a thing for a reasonable price (what not always is the lowest price) to acquire and to exclude wrongful enrichment or even criminal actions.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the lowering of threshold values for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this aim.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Maybe it is even in such a way that we load the system in this manner only with excessive "paperwork", and those which search gaps in the system substantially easier have it to use the system, as if the threshold values remained higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">They speak of the problems with the practical conversion of the Czech assignment law.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system function in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there here a similar authority like our NK Ú, or does the system differently function?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What concerns the authorities, the German counterpart to the NK Ú is the federal Court of Auditors which is alike built up like with us and also about a board orders which is formed merely a little bit differently. Nevertheless, basically both authorities work alike.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also the competence is comparable to some degree and Germany is, nevertheless, a federal state, i.e. that there are these courts of audit also in the single federal states - in it the German system differs from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The BRH may control only Federal Funds what corresponds to our state means.</seg>
<seg id="26">The public means which are administered with us by the districts and municipalities are defeated there by the control of the land courts of audit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What concerns the German legislation, is easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general I would compare this without concrete information only reluctantly. Germany is nevertheless called, in a way, often model and, however, one does not determine can say that Germany is better in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Is this maybe due to the fact that there the examiners are better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">This does not determine, but as said: I particularly do not like such comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">Moreover is still to be marked that also those countries which are a model for us also have to fight with problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise would they have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, right?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What concerns the Czech legislation which meaning had the amendment of the assignment law for your authority, you already feel some effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In consideration of that that this novella is an only short time in strength she does not affect in our check up to now yet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because our controls take place afterwards, here one must count on a certain delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We feel effects up to now rather in the preparatory phase of future controls - we have introduced the new controlling instrument "recognition of risks of the uneconomicalness" and have examined with these nearly 14,000 public orders and have analysed - here the changes will affect of course, because the threshold values change which were modified conditions on certain kinds of advertising among other things</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you see the discharge of this law rather positive, or is the system loaded with other bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a 1 step in the right direction and hopes that this acceptance is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Nevertheless, the problem can appear that the rules can become "stricter and not be kept any more.</seg>
<seg id="40">Already under the previous rules the people submitted a check are liable to account towards the bearer (for example, in case of an operational programme of the regional policy, to the regional advice) from that point of view that every disregard of the assignment law of an injury of the budgetary discipline amounts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Does it make sense then, however to make the law even stricter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">In my opinion not in this manner.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those which want to attack the system and abuse, and not those punish which have committed an irregularity which does not affect the real decision-making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system puts merely the bureaucracy under even bigger pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Where is here the way out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">If we say first once which way is not aim-leading.</seg>
<seg id="47">The prime minister recently said that the ODS the enterprisers did not bother with controls of the so-called "black system" - what is this called exactly?</seg>
<seg id="48">Is the black system forbidden now or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">Nevertheless, a law must have his validity, and if is forbidden a little bit legally, nevertheless, the government chairperson cannot simply come, and hinder the controlling office whose duty is anyway the control of the observance of the law in his activity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He can say: "We change the law and permit the thing", but he cannot say that we act in such a way, as if nothing was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The assignment law contains relatively strict rules about the formal implementation of certain processes - and this is also right for the protection of the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">However, on the other side it is also tragic if the bidder only with the best offer is excluded on the basis of irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will be never perfect, but it must be properly applied - and this is that what is absent with us in my opinion.</seg>

<seg id="26">This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees under the freezing point.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because it has been snowing before and afterwards the temperatures fell, it can come on the streets to icy roads.</seg>
<seg id="28">Moreover, locally is to be calculated on fog and the view will improve, nevertheless, in the day course.</seg>
<seg id="29">This information comes from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien.</seg>

<seg id="31">The roadways of the first street class are predominantly dry, have frozen solid, however.</seg>
<seg id="32">Nevertheless, in the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov it can come in sections to icy roads.</seg>
<seg id="33">The roadways of the second and third street class are humid, and, hence, is also valid here the tip to possible iced up segments.</seg>
<seg id="34">Drivers should be especially careful primarily on the less popular streets in the area of the Bohemian Forest.</seg>

<seg id="39">In the remaining areas of the district the roadways are mostly unconditionally practicable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">"In the circle Š umperk still snowy leftovers remain in the height situations.</seg>
<seg id="41">The drivers must count on the passport Červenohorské sedlo in the direction of Jeseník with snowy mush", said an employee of the street management Š umperk today compared with the agency ČTK.</seg>
<seg id="42">Also her colleagues in the circle of Jeseník had to come out at night, according to her information the streets are free till the height situations after chemical treatment and are wet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the circle of Olomouc the streets are unconditionally practicable, nevertheless, in the circle Š ternberk the drivers must go in forest segments carefully, because here the roadways are still humid.</seg>

<seg id="51">From the main distances as well as from the street I / 13 on the border of the districts Ú stí N. L. and Liberec are announced bad traffic terms.</seg>
<seg id="52">The blockage of the street between Telnice and Knínice was necessary on the basis of branches which were pressed by the snowy load up to the roadway.</seg>

<seg id="1">Š imon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about the fact that in less than one month the end of the world should take place?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is one of those disaster announcements at which we jump at people so with pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="4">With our volume The Tap Tap we make fun rather of it and say that we are the only tape of the world which can collect enough positive energy to detain the end of the world or to prevent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Moreover, in December you realise a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you introduce to our readers the project closer?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It concerns a national benefit performance event which we already plan two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya's calendar whose end is forecast for 21st of December at 11:10 o'clock in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the day before it, i.e. on the 20th of December, compensate 21:00 o'clock at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava instead of.</seg>
<seg id="10">The end of the concerts should be in possibly at the time at which on the Pacific island Kiribati which lies in a time zone about 12 hours before us the Maya's calendar ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">From whom does this idea come?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally probably from ourselves, afterwards we have decorated the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">Besides, we would like to collect not only enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we would also like to think together with the public about it in which state we hand over this world once to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the Maya's calendar we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key followers against the end of the world with whose purchase about www.e-tap.cz to us the people can also support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The volume The Tap Tap has together with other interpreters, moreover, also the so-called. Hymn against the end of the world with the title "End of the world falls from" taken up.</seg>
<seg id="16">Already today the hymn on YouTube is liked very much. Will she also sound on the charity concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, namely completely in the end, provided that everything claps and the end of the world does not take place...</seg>
<seg id="18">The hymn should be sung about all interpreters on all three concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover, the hymns will broadcast live together in a direct circuit of the Czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The text of the hymn comes from Tomá š Hanák which also plays the central figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X joins in the singing...</seg>
<seg id="21">How have you come to the cooperation with both?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We also co-operate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene what hangs up together with the fact that we realise many benefit performance events and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We try to integrate these people intensely into our projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">Besides, has appeared that most are interested in a cooperation with us, and have fun in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">For which purpose is the proceed of the concerts of benefit against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the equipment of the educational centre of Studeo without barriers on which we already work six years together with the association Tap in the Jedlička institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">The schoolboys of the Jedlička institute are examined regularly by foreign language assistants who help them at different leisure activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because the schoolboys themselves do not dispose of the means to visit the foreign language assistants, we would like to help them in this manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">In frame of the completion of the Jedlička institute own building in which we enter then with this project should originate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">With every concert several groups and interpreters appear.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to which criteria have you selected this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We wanted to put together a programme which responds all generations including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">In Prague, for example, China ski step, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří visit ý.</seg>
<seg id="34">You find out all other one on the Internet site www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we appear for the first time in the Prague spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">The next year we would also like to appear with pleasure in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are then already in the USA - would connect this also with pleasure with appearances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Their foreign plans are not quite small, up to now you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">Nevertheless, The Tap Tap is a group which consists of people with impediments.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you master these trips logistically and organizationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not so bad as it appears at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five our members are wheel chair drivers, i.e. the wheel chairs must be carried in the left luggage office. Moreover, we must carry along of course many instrument suitcases and other luggage...</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless it has up to now always worked without problems, ČSA and British airways were prepared always very well for us that I have sometimes partially already been surprised.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow where we were recently there were no problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">By your foreign tours you have a comparison as it looks in the single countries with barrier freedom like one there with handicapped people handles etc.</seg>
<seg id="46">How have you experienced these things up to now?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other towns in which everything better functions than with us we were just in Russia witnesses of that that in the east still everything is in his beginnings.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared with Prague Moscow is suitable for the handicapped not at all. There it is still unusual if somebody is on the move only in the wheel chair in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is not natural there yet that one lets go in front a wheel chair driver, for example, in the lift.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, also originate there associations which try to point to the problems of people with impediments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in which regard we must catch up compared with the developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are still many things in which we hang behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">However, in addition is still to be marked that an improvement of the situation also depends always on the endeavours of the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is absolutely usual that also people move with heavy impediments independently in the public space, go to the museum, toilets can be of use etc.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, it is not quite usual that there a bigger group of handicapped people takes part actively in the social events, in it we are with the volume The Tap Tap to the west a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect in public and barrier freedom is a thing, but only if from our rows of important sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come, will really start the things to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">Up to now are this only isolated cases of especially strong-minded personalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Tap Tap is very popular currently. If we decrease, however, a few years: What has motivated you in 1998 to found a volume?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">At that time I started as a responsible person in the Jedlička institute where I met many young people who were interested to deal with a little bit intensely.</seg>
<seg id="60">And because I myself am a musician and play among other things the saxophone, I have founded together with a colleague a music AG.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and with the time this is, like our presenter, Láďa Angelovič, is in habit to say, (laughs) a little bit out of control advisably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Was the tape known, however, only during the last years, or crazily I me?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is right that the cooperation with known singers has helped us; moreover, we have also started advertising actively to ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="64">To us has become conscious, that if one performs something and this is not to be seen to the outside which does not exist own achievement in certain sense.</seg>
<seg id="65">Moreover, thanks to the EU-conveyor money we can afford good foreign language assistants, high-quality devices and among other things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Was it your aim to bring it with The Tap Tap so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the outset I have felt the potential that one can differently concern the things.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today in the show business one often copies the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical in his manner, because all new with care is looked and is accepted only after longer time.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are only few really unique things, and I dare to state that Tap Tap belongs to it.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression which the spectator mostly has is of course a compassion; this is only natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people are no lonesome and desolate beings with impediments which we would have to regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided that they have the means necessary in addition.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that when person succeeds with impediments something, this is not only for themselves a progress, but for the whole society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, how does one hear from many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If one liked to make good something, one may enter in many things no compromises and must also call a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this is absolutely normal in my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some come to us with romantic images, and if then they find out that they have test twice the week, preparatory phases must finish and spend a lot of time on concert travelling, then the enthusiasm goes out with many fast.</seg>
<seg id="79">However, thus it functions everywhere, in every volume which seriously wants to work and reach something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently The Tap Tap has twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">Besides, how many of it were from the outset, i.e. since 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only just one: Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent this.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and is always welcome the desire in taking part, with us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Finds instead of on the day before the forecast end of the world, Thursday to the 12/20/2012 at 21 o'clock</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech tapes and other musicians</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">All three venues are connected in the end by live circuit with each other and there sounds a common interpretation of the hymn "end of the world falls from the" volume The Tap Tap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The aim of the concert is to raise the means for the equipment of a multifunctional educational centre suitable for the handicapped that should originate under the name STUDEO in the Jedlička institute in Prague. Matter of expense: 25 million CZK</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The entry costs 400 CZK, children till 12 years free of charge, maps are available in advance with Bohemiaticket.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The last week Poland on a minister's council meeting of the member countries of the European space organisation ESA was taken up as the twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is with it the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (to Czechia which on the 12th of November, 2008 ESA member became).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began in 1994 a close collaboration with the ESA and took part during the following years in several ESA projects.</seg>
<seg id="4">The way of Poland in the space began, admittedly, much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Already before the Second World War Polish eager with universe dealt with the astronautics and they not always bumped with it into understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I remind here, for example, of the talk from A. Š field Tern from the 6th of December, 1933 in the Warsaw observatory with which the author introduced thought from his pioneering work "to entrance to the Kosmonautik".</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners, nevertheless, cold, and after years still remembered Š field Tern that merely Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Š field Tern REP deer won in 1934 for "entrance to the Kosmonautik" from Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch donated Prix.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became later an important advocate of the astronomy and the astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomskis worldwide approved contribution to the development of the astronautics was appreciated among other things by the fact that one of the craters on the earth-turned away side of the moon was named after him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 a railway hand trolley for which a rocket impulse was planned was built in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the draught and the details of this plan remained unknown.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not cleared yet whether the rocket should be used for starting or to the braking of the hand trolley.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover the information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-pursued floors.</seg>
<seg id="17">The institute of Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia led the research projects in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the traditional documents is evident that the research had penetrated till the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the research was interrupted, admittedly, by the invasion of the German armed forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 the draught coming from engineer Rohoziński of a fotoelektrischen hunting rocket appeared in the specialist publications, and in the next year appeared the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket impulse.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war all projects were co-ordinated to the military use of the rocket technology by the passing scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was furnished in 1937, nevertheless, after two-year-old activity his work was finished from the war beginning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other articles to the astronautics appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">The first mention of this society occurs in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy in which four extensive articles of the astronautics are dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="26">The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the foundation of a space society.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the investigation of the space would have future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Already in her beginnings in 1956 the Polish space society PTA took care of an entry to the international federation founded in 1951 for astronautics, and really became the PTA already in autumn, 1956 well-arranged member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The next year the first PTA chairperson, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), acting chairpersons of the international federation became for astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">He held this office up to his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 took part the PTA decisively in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for the scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type, RM-1, was finished in 1957, the first start occurred on the 10th of October, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket with a maximum flight altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh completely 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later an improved version, RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 dów desert flight tests began RM-2 in the Bł ę with the two-stage rocket.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">An other stage of development should be already able to perform real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight altitude from up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of height hoists.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 1962, nevertheless, the further development was put.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Successor of the first rockets of the type RM became Meteor 1 rocket developed in the years from 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, her total length amounted to 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three types were developed by this rocket (Meteor-1A,-1B and-1C) which differed of each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The meteor 1A rocket disposed of a transport space with 0.4 litres of capacity, Meteor-1B more than 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C more than 0.62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum flight altitude amounted with all three types 37 Km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the years from 1965 to 1968 Meteor 2 rockets whose first flight tests began in October, 1970 was developed in the aviation institute.</seg>
<seg id="44">Meteor 2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a pay load of 10 kg in a height by chance 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then the versions Meteor-2H and meteor 3 were built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The entry of Poland is also worth mentioning to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 which two years later the foundation of a national COSPAR committee followed.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland took part within the scope of the interuniverse programme also in the space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The abolition of the law about charitable works is no solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week the constitutional court lifted the law about charitable works.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision caused in public a lively discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is interesting certainly to look at the problems sometimes from a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of the unadjusted economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the final effect this means that the single national economies stand during a permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cause for it is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of the private capital which goes with unrestrained finance speculations hand to hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">On account of the big differences of the value of work (wages) it comes to prize tensions.</seg>
<seg id="9">By this concept is to be understood a state with which the manufacturer tries to exist by import of favorable goods in the economic competition, while he "underbids" the competition to tear thereby a bigger share of the market in himself and to raise his profit.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a large scale this indicates for most enterprises to move her manufacturing abroad or to make purchases there favourably, or to surrender, however, her business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparably high labour cost.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the private capital bears no social responsibility and with it also no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, the state expenses necessarily rise.</seg>
<seg id="12">This situation is still strengthened by the fact that Messrs. Unternehmer are absolutely indignant to pay her taxes and to make good thereby the whole-social economic and social damages caused by them.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is known in general, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.</seg>
<seg id="14">The thoughtless practise of the private capital creates in the single national economies a situation in which the governments feel constrained to step in competition with each other to lower the social level of own population artificially and to lure with it foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words: The governments deliver own population without taking into consideration the social results to the private capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">This expresses itself in particular in changes of valid laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim of these measures is to force own population, to accept the dictation of the private capital in particular in the wage area.</seg>
<seg id="18">This happens on the one hand by economic compulsion with long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the curtailment of the employee's rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result are growing poverty, as well as bigger and bigger differences between arm and empire.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany there are already for some years public food delivery places for arms which are not able any more to live by own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of the affected persons already goes to the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the course of the increase of the competition ability of the German economy it comes regularly to cases in which employees receive a so low wage that the state must increase her income up to the subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">A such scandal was also uncovered in case of from employed in the Bundestag the German to assistants.</seg>
<seg id="24">The economy measures practically of all EU-south states will run out certainly to the same state with which the people are made under the pressure of a catastrophic fall of her social level emigrate (as it was in the 19th century the case) or to live in want for starvation wages on the edge of the society and to hope, besides, for the fact that sometime private investment capital will flow into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here the question suggests itself naturally, where from this capital comes?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it comes from another EU country, merely the poverty of a country walks in the other; or the capital is missing equally completely, because in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco or Egypt or in Africa the employees work generally for a fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This completely concerns Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theories and media state up to the surfeit that itself the state with capital is not allowed to do in his own national economy to involved ones, and that planned economy leads to the economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private capital persists illiberally on his position that the state may not intervene steering in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then, however, one must ask himself whether the not private capital influences the politics and with it the whole state in own selfish sense or steers even.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here is the unequivocal answer: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof of it is the existence of a practically omnipotent and in all states omnipresent lobby.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is punishable a desperate situation in the area of the corruption, the mutual Bevorteilung, a legislation in which practically everything is punishable, but nothing.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the situation is in such a way that a state ministry instructs private, close with the industry intertwined legal enterprises with the elaboration of bills in the absence of finances.</seg>
<seg id="35">Afterwards these bills are dismissed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then all power does not assume any more from the people how it the western constitutions announce, but from strong groups of financiers which prefer her own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Obviously the liberal democracies get currently fast in a situation as she describes Appian in his work to the crisis of the Roman republic at times of Caesar and Pompeius': "The state was understood already for a long time in the decay, and the offices were taken by force.</seg>
<seg id="38">Against bribe, by unlawful acquisition by false pretenses of advantages or with stone and sword.</seg>
<seg id="39">The corruption grew rampant unrestrained, and the people went with already bought voices for the choice "..." People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had during eight months no consul as a result of this decline "..." One started to speak quite really of the fact that the only medicine is an autocracy in this heavy situation, and that a strong man must be chosen"... Though, besides, Appian thought of Pompeius, but then the strong man was, finally, a Caesar who substituted for the democracy permanently with the autocracy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As appears, the today's society just as in the antiquity on the thoughtless preference of own advantage is based without paying attention to whole-social interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital is not already able from his nature to recognise the advantage for the whole society and to put through.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result, today how at that time, is an unprecedented decadence of the élites which do not take care in the least of deep-going out reforms.</seg>
<seg id="43">We must search the cause for the amount of the fascism and the communism, hence, in the thoughtless liberalisation of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="44">Seen from the today's state, the setting this regime can be looked in favour of liberal democracies as the certain break with which the next round already stands out.</seg>
<seg id="45">The fact is especially catastrophic that the today's élites to the in future possible losses of hundred thousands of human life, the humanitarian and social disasters whose witness we already are today, as well as the crimes against the humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history, face in perfect ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="46">The abolition of the law about charitable works is here no solution, at least no lasting one.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition Czechia will be made search ways also furthermore to press the social level of the population down.</seg>
<seg id="48">Hence, this trend is system-conditioned.</seg>
<seg id="49">The only solution are specific political-social reforms which increase the capital participation of the state in the economy, raise the influence of the citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of the private capital in the society in favour of the state.</seg>

<seg id="4">After the last wave of the power between Israel and the Gaza Strip there was, as usual, an immense number of reactions.</seg>
<seg id="5">One stand behind Israel and argue with his right on self-defence, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others support the Palestinians again, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed in the Palestinian Arabs and call the state Israel terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would not like to write at this point who is a victim in these always returning waves of the Tötens of culprits and who; at last the today's inhabitants of Israel became including the self-government areas in the present political situation hineingeboren and have not experienced the beginning of the power even.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is a matter for me of opening the look behind the scenery for the readers, the look at to whom 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration are above all useful in November, 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="8">My thoughts partially rest on accessible historical facts, other are derived from these and arise from my own understanding of who influences the events of the modern history or which group of people decisively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of the humanity is, primarily, a history of the fight for the power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every epoch we can put out Alexander the tallness or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">That what is less seeming is the question whether these were really always these personalities themselves which determined her steps autonomous, or whether behind her throne somebody stood which steered her actions on a predetermined aim.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit ourselves that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world concentrates in the hand of less singles, and that this concentration of the money and which has not originated from it arising power within the span of life of one generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Under this astronomically to rich families particularly stands out which one could call head of the octopus (I do not know whether about them still somebody stands, I do not exclude this, however) - which Rothschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">A lot it is not written about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Clear proofs.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) was bought from Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of her name with highly criminal actions, in which background always the strengthening of her power which stood increase of her property or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks they wage wars or prepare on this (before the raid on Afghanistan these were 7 countries, after the raid on Iraq these were 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis only four remained and Russia has subordinated his central bank of the Russian government) in the interim.</seg>
<seg id="18">Whoever has tried to oppose this family, had to pay with the life for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war, own (speak: state to publish bank notes) and was murdered in 1865 at a theatre.</seg>
<seg id="20">J.F.Kennedy began to publish own bank notes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the representative Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after he wanted to sue the FED because of release of the worldwide economic crisis in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The global power cravings of Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - in 1871 to the formulation of a plan to the Entfesselung of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of 33. and with it of the highest degree of the knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war had to the aim to remove the big monarchist state beings of Europe, in particular the colonial rule of Great Britain should be broken by the second war, and the third war has to do the world population on about 0.5 - 1 milliard people reduce (such a number would provide for her comfort and her luxury and would also not use so many resources), a universal religion create (the Ökumenismus is here nothing else as the approach) and, finally, for the takeover of the absolute power lead.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method with which the group of the richest families with Rothschilds works at the head is the release of a crisis and the next offer of a solution (order from chao - order from the chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the increase of the situation (see foundation of the FED, so that crises do not recur like from them in 1907 released).</seg>
<seg id="25">After they had succeeded by the murder of the Habsburg successor to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo in releasing the First World War, they destroyed the Russian czardom by the revolution the Bolshevik.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically groundless capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian czardom the war was not necessary any more), afterwards the resolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary occurred.</seg>
<seg id="27">To be able to kindle easier the Second World War, the bankers let by the politics create a latent conflict situation, while they booked Germany with huge Kriegsreparationen; thereby they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they had to unterrejoice the Germans only an enough strong leader who offered the culprits named and easy solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority which should take the function of the fifth column and also took to kindle the war fire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement with which a branch aimed at the foundation of a Jew's state possibly in the historical area Judäas with Jerusalem as a capital (return after Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The already mentioned Balfour declaration created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first collisions with the resident Arabian population.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were terrorist attacks on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out, and whether now Hitler broke loose from the chain in which him the international bankers had held initial, or whether everything ran after plan, is only difficult to estimate, anyway the grief of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was founded in 1948, and just as by the Kriegsreparationen against Germany the way for the Second World War was paved, the proclamation of the state Israel shows the creation of the focus for the third world war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers succeed in provoking this war, the Jewish people become as during the Second World War the victim in the foremost fight line, this time together with the Arabian or Muslim population of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a gigantic lab, a spring of the quarrel and the chaos, not only in the country, but also internationally (one remembers only how sharply itself the people divide into follower and opponent of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is the culprit and who the victim during the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites where wrong releases only wrong in an endless spiral of the power and at the beginning the avarice of singles and her striving for global power stood?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">One must make a distinction here between the inhabitants of Israel and her guidance, nevertheless, the international bankers place in Israel just as with us, the people, exclusively her own candidates for the choice.</seg>
<seg id="37">The present prime minister of Israel whom falcon Netanjahu, a typical example of a susceptible to fascism one, to the international bankers is loyally of devoted politician who does everything for it to kindle a war with Iran which could expand in view of the membership of Iran in the Schanghaier organisation for cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly into a global conflict, and with which it run because of the control of Iran of the only 2 miles wide street of Hormus, through 20% of the worldwide oil deliveries to a destruction of the world economy could come.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film Argo: If it stands worst, Hollywood call</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November, 1979 a mob of demonstrating Islamic students took the US-American message in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.</seg>
<seg id="3">For their release they demanded the delivery of the overthrown shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who had fled after the revolution in the USA which had protected the patronage about his regime for decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the American government there was from this situation no positive way out - she could not afford to abandon the shah, because this would have damaged the trust of her allies in other countries massively.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time she was not able, in Iran where the revolution flowed into the installation of a theokratischen regime to put through the release of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a heavy blow for the call of the united states, and the next fiasco with the forcible attempt of the hostage's freeing made everything only bad.</seg>
<seg id="7">The arrested diplomats were released, finally, after 444 days, after negotiations had been provided by the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">The destiny of the hostages caused at home a wave of the solidarity as well as anti-Iranian moods.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran considerably contributed to the defeat Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan with the presidential elections in 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history which gave a small part victory to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="11">Immediately before the occupation of the message six message employees managed the escape.</seg>
<seg id="12">This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities in bringing the refugees from Iran; an extravagant story helped to them in it to the cover of her true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports in disguise as members of a film stick which visited locations for a science fiction film supposedly in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of the genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">From the expert for "ex-filtration", Tony Mendez, plan developed the cooperation of Hollywood also required.</seg>
<seg id="16">So that the camouflage became plausible, articles about this film project appeared in technical periodicals, press conferences were held, and the fictive production society had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of this operation were kept secret long. The film rests on the recollections of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand it is a realistic political thriller, at the same time, however, also one so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the history of a successful exploit as for example the film Ocean's Student.</seg>
<seg id="20">The mood levels thereby alternate in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the title sequence are shown ikonische contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other side the loose passages from Hollywood, ironically and easily exaggerates come along.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there are still the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits in the conference table, on the office halls, on the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck has managed with this film a noteworthy new start of his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From a smiled actor a respectable director has become, and also now as an actor it is not any more the aim of ironic remarks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature after the crime film no child's play (Gone baby Gone, in 2007) and the thriller town mercilessly (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time it is Afflecks the first film which does not play in home Boston of the director.</seg>
<seg id="27">Besides, the feel for the atmosphere of the place belonged to the signs which removed the previous films of this director of the standard of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck proves this feel, nevertheless, also in Argo where Teheran of Canada is "played".</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events which have really taken place - the input sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in her clarity, and, besides, provides still the feeling of the confusion and the Unvorhersehbarkeit, this enters if somewhere once the history moves.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect achieves Affleck with his team also with fictive scenes (the wrong film stick on a bazaar in Teheran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much action at too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director also had to argue with the fact that the history offers not really many scenes stretching in the cinematic sense.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, with few he works rather successfully and he helps the reality sometimes something - what looks so elegant then not always (the scenes in which the menacing crisis on the airport is turned away in Teheran by a telephone call in America, or also the pursuit hunt on the start road, look a little bit unnatural).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is his much too wide dispersion which is caused by the need to have to point too much in action at too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Though Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very winning in her roles as a Hollywood employee, however, her figures would have earned more space, and with it they stand in the film by far not only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Afflecks film thereby loses something to tractive power. It is a film which one can pursue with certain interest and appreciate, besides, the creation and to a thriller from the 70th years reminding retro style.</seg>
<seg id="37">He wakes up enthusiasm, nevertheless, only hard.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a recollection of a piece living till this day in certain manner of history and as a proof of that, as coatedly, nevertheless, the images of the omnipotent and omniscient Secret Services are, nevertheless, he is enough.</seg>

<seg id="1">Directives for inflating of aerial balloons, for bananas and for the circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com which exclaims annually a survey about the absurdest bank charges has decided this year to organise the competition "the absurdest order or idea from the EU workshop".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"On this idea the plan recently proposed by the EU made us introduce a women's rate of 40% in the management of big European companies", said Patrik Nacher who looks after the organisation of this survey compared with the newspaper Právo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Under the nominated Absurditäten, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice about the standardization of the insurance rates is for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Till then women enjoyed an advantage with life insurances because they show objectively a lower risk for the insurance societies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Other unbelievable inspirations from the EU workshop can be nominated till the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then the real vote occurs till the end of February, 2013", informed Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The obliging admixture of Bioethanol belongs among other things to the controversial EU orders to fuels which is nature-damaging in her result, furthermore the ban of the reliable mercury thermometers, only because contain this one relatively small quantity of this danger material, or also the directive to the size of the chicken cages because of which this year eggs became substantially more expensive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Criticism harvested in the past also the actual ban of the use of the concept "Butter spread" or also the sales ban on customary light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Bananas must be 14 cm long</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry whose demands are represented in Brussels as a rule by one or several member countries (Czechia tries currently, for example to put through the demands of Czech banks also with veto threat).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Lobby interests were behind it also that bananas of the highest commercial class must be at least 14 cm long in the EU and may show no "bend anomaly".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Besides, the European Commission defended itself with the argument that it harmonises merely the nonuniform state norms which would hinder trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The norms with regard to fruit and vegetables were made soft by the EU against the opposition of some countries already with the tip that the present directives would lead to a squandering of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate for the victory in this survey is possibly the EU order of the last year which according to aerial balloons by the sales must be provided with the tip that children may inflate the aerial balloon not without supervision of an adult less than eight years.</seg>
<seg id="16">Besides, the EU appealed to an American study which according to aerial balloons the leading cause are in the suffocation death of children.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction is already valid for children till 14 years with the use of Jahrmarktströten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">There are strange inspirations also at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Relatively absurd is also a directive which concerns the European officials - everybody which takes an official function in the EU, the name may not use because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece Macedonia and must say, instead, FYROM (moulder Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server nominated Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez fair beside o.g. Absurditäten also the EU order about the extent of stocks of food in the area of a member country.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU fixed with it the Höchstvolumen in stocks of food which might be on the day of our EU entry on the area of Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">Then Czechia crossed, e.g., the agreed volume for mushroom canned food for which to us a high fine threatened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for the fact that they have no sea, or, however, from the idea to give conveyor money for applications for conveyor money.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas came, admittedly, not from Brussels, but from Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will apply by the EU restitution", explained in autumn, 2004 the Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas at that time (ČSSD).</seg>
<seg id="27">As an argument he stated that the grain harvest has been very high and the state camps as a result of the so-called. Intervention shopping was overcrowded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Because Czechia has an other way to seaports, the EU according to palace should pay hundreds of millions euros to us.</seg>
<seg id="29">The European Commission met Czechia, finally, so far that it organised an advertising about the purchase of grain from countries which have no access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">The ministry of regional development under the direction of minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) offered conveyor money for applications for conveyor money to the municipalities, besides, specifically it should concern means for the Aufsetzung of conveyor money applications in Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The EU: Weird orders are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Orders are earned in the member countries though easily to the target of the criticism, the efforts of the EU towards regulation and with it also around effectiveness and development of the whole European Union according to opinion of some experts, nevertheless, rather recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A more serious problem is according to opinion of these experts rather the EU-conveyor money for projects which have in common purely nothing at all with deepening the European integration which were forced, nevertheless, at the budgetary negotiations by single member countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The fact causes in this country also emotions that Czechia must fight as other member countries in Brussels for the right on use of specific names of traditional products and this fight, besides, not always wins.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Though Czechia could defend after a 6-year-old fight with Germany and Austria the name "Olomoucké tvar þ ky", nevertheless, our manufacturers had to rename the native's rum (Tuzemsk ý around) whose tradition goes back with us till the 19th century as "Tuzemák".</seg>
<seg id="36">The name Rum may be used only for products from sugarcane distillate, not for products from sugar beets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the official list of the products registered in the EU dip in the society of the world-famous cheese kinds Feta and gorgonzola, of the Lübeck marzipan or the Parmaschinkens now also the Karl's barber-surgeon rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Třebo ň, or also the Saazer hop on.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Mr. senator, how one has the idea to run for election for the office of the president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">It is not a matter for me of being a senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If in our country everything functioned without problems, I would nowhere run for election.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I cannot look any more with at how the republic is looted for 20 years as thieves freely walk around, while the people the taxes and the retirement age are raised.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambitions to become a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">If I see, however, something what I do not like, then I try to suggest a solution to change this.</seg>
<seg id="8">And because I am already more than 40, and in addition independently and independent, I have no other possibility to influence the things, to run for election as for the office of a senator or the president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the senate you have created it and then have come along immediately on the way in the castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Do you thereby not turn to your voters the back?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I have said myself all the time that I take up the fight for the castle after the result of the senatorial elections.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later I have specified this and have said that I run for election for the office of the president, provided that I am chosen the senator.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, my aim is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realise my visions.</seg>
<seg id="14">For it I need possibly a lot of influence and a very strong mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">The difficulty consists in the fact not only that we get angry as people in the bar and before the television, but massacre everybody which wants to change something.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition come the media which want to rob of the honour one, and which mistake to lie the freedom of the word with the freedom.</seg>
<seg id="17">About me it was maintained, for example that I bribed journalists or that I was an adviser of Jiří Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If we speak of your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have taken up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective property explanations more than 20 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition you must change laws.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a president you have in this regard no competence, and only the senate as a whole can introduce law proposals.</seg>
<seg id="22">How want you to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As an easy citizen I have exerted myself for the fact that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be put through.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is the small-spiritual politics - if somebody comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this is rejected intentionally, and this only detains the population.</seg>
<seg id="25">As independent independents I dispose of a by far bigger potential to win support at all parties represented in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage consists in the fact that I can take without drawer thinking and party dogmas of every party this what is the best for our country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you see yourselves as a person in the politics rather on the right or on the left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From Czech view seems to me that me the people see rather on the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, for me this legal link thinking is absolutely insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me is important that we get on.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is not for me about whether somebody belongs to the left or to the right camp; I would like to connect the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always I support publicly every good solution beginning, even if this of the KSČM or from the ODS comes, and also I will turn against bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It displeases you if somebody calls you populists.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, do you not confirm by what you have just said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If you put up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal aim and a vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you would like to approach this.</seg>
<seg id="37">One can call this because of me populism, but all proposals of which I have spoken already function in the world, or they were discussed by important experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without support in the parliament only catchwords remain to you.</seg>
<seg id="39">And with it you come not far in the politics in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you believe that you if you talk only long enough with the people succeed in putting through, for example, the material and criminal liability?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other possibility.</seg>
<seg id="42">To persuade politician, journalists and the public and to try, to bring them on our side to put through these aims.</seg>
<seg id="43">As a president it would be for me no problem to request the chairpersons of the parliament parties live on television, to anchor the material and criminal liability for politician, officials, judges and public prosecutors legally.</seg>
<seg id="44">And then the appealed would have to say if necessary, why they reject this.</seg>
<seg id="45">A strong personality which points to mismanagement can exert pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take only once the direct choice of the president which was a salary of the public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try to find allies for my views and visions.</seg>
<seg id="49">I have started with the politics scarcely and try to find the support of the majority for my programme.</seg>
<seg id="50">I always try to judge the things independently; and if it does not work, I decrease in six years again in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">This sounds a little, as if Okamura Czechia should save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am no rescuer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that I reach alone nothing; therefore, I have spoken with several known personalities of whether they did not like to run for election also for the senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I have spoken, e.g., with Radim Jančura which declined, nevertheless, because of overworking.</seg>
<seg id="55">Moreover, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who uncovered the deception with trade with light fuel oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I began my candidature with the condition that the people are deeply discontented, but now I am not sure any more.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the voters have not gone at all for the elections, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representative of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the senate we are with it only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be only very hardly enforcable.</seg>
<seg id="60">Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g., for the direct dialling of the mayors and district captains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about the foundation of own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not thought about it yet because I have no time to check the past of every potential party member, and also at all the money for it does not have.</seg>
<seg id="63">I do not have yet sometimes money for the presidential campaign; on my clear account are only 20,000 CZK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">They have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">They speak of property explanations, how did theirs look?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I estimate my private property at about 60 million CZK.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague I have a property with a value of 25 millions, a flat for about 10 millions, next for 8 millions, an art collection which is worth about 10 millions, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 millions and Š kodu the Superb which is worth about one million. And then I have a few more millions on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Aston Martin was, by the way, a child dream - I always liked James Bond as he went in the car, was gallantly to women and fought at the same time against Bad.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">They drive an Aston Martin, have a property of 60 millions and have no money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">They say that you want to change the republic, but you would not like to invest your own money in it.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not quite persuasive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have no 15 millions for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Should I incur possibly debts?</seg>
<seg id="74">I have already put 2.5 millions in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my programme probably wakes up not too a lot of interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from own means.</seg>
<seg id="77">The costs for the campaign are covered basically by my salary as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But only from the senator's salary I could not live; thus I could not finance, e.g., to my son the English school which costs 30,000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to earn only money, I would run for election for nothing at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Do you remain as an enterpriser active to have your living?</seg>
<seg id="81">Did you not say that you drive back these activities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But this does not hang together with the height of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, I have partially driven back my activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">Thus, e.g., my deputy becomes a manager of the travel agency in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">The people want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But, nevertheless, I must also live on something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">To which monthly income were you accustomed as an enterpriser?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">From about 200,000 to 400,000, and this also is furthermore in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="89">Nevertheless, as a president I would completely put my enterprises.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The architects MVRDV prove that the true adventures not only in the head are - at the example of Spijkenisse and the recently established book mountain - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I find the building amusing, it looks futuristic, and, finally, there is something interesting again to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by in the street edge.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, IT engineer in a nearby large-scale enterprise, means: "Nevertheless, nicely it is already, the house."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I ask myself for which we need even today a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everybody has Internet, iPad and E-Books.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one goes even today voluntarily to one of these Old style libraries, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a hardly inspection-destitute sleeping town before the gates of Rotterdam, is an odd record holder.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 80,000-inhabitant municipality shows the lowest educational rate of the whole Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To counteract against this silly fact, one decided some years ago to contribute to the general education and to copy seven fictive bridges which are shown on the euronotes, as nicely painted ferro-concrete miniatures.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational offensive kept to a certain extent.</seg>
<seg id="11">And thus the town fathers recognised that there would be only one single possibility to become man the statistics: A library has to go here!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy the Meuse of the Rotterdam architect's office MVRDV, master of the reckless bar graphs and producer of witty often cynical constructions, took the thing with usual calmness and appeared to the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin in the face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury still watched taken aback around itself and twitched with the shoulders, stacked to the cheeky Meuse his select small presents of the size to a pyramid and finished his aktionistisch underpinned speech with the words: "Dear municipality!"</seg>
<seg id="14">This is he, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called mountain Böken!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later the mountain at cost of 30 million euros is piled up.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is a part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts to which also underground parking, supermarket, post and a few adjoining dwelling houses and row houses with a total of 50 flats belong.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November the book mountain with the second price "Best Library of NL 2012" was distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, the project is nominated for the Dutch Nationwide Wood Award in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">With it is the anonymous provincial town retort which did not have to offer to date any more than a Postmodernism pelican crossing and an in bewilderment ugly city hall behind whose white facades one would be bent to suppose a dairy factory, around a piece of contemporary architecture more richly.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now above all, however, Spijkenisse disposes of the first public cultural construction in the history of his existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long way to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: Book Eldorado under cheese bell.</seg>
<seg id="23">Though there is a lift which leads in the middle through the mountain massif, however, the true space joys and reading joys disclose with scaling foot-in heat of the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The around glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt brick ground and the elegant street lanterns speak unmistakably the language of a public town place.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urbane ambience is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">One already keeps a lookout after park-bench, dog and football to playing boys and girl.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"The bookshelves stand ordinarily along the facade, and in the middle lies a big, dark space which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy the Meuse.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have turned upside down the classical space configuration and have turned the reading area from the inside outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inside of the book mountain is used cleverly: In the middle lie offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and house technology headquarters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A special joy are the black bookshelves which are sometimes a wall disguising, sometimes balustrade, sometimes narrow staircase railing.</seg>
<seg id="32">Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even confirmed architects and structural engineers shake the head on account of the unknown building material.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work here with recycling materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager with the municipality Spijkenisse, on inquiry of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And thus we have bumped in a friesländischen agrarian company one day into a suitable by-product from the agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years one uses in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields a millimetre-thin plastic fleece as a root base.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is cheap and time-efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin textiles keep, two Saisonen, then it is ripe for the bulky refuse.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library the fleece - for the first time in these amounts was pressed - to four-centimetre-thick records.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under heat effect and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) changes colour to a dark, homogeneous material capable of load which smells bissl of new carriage and bissl after sports shoe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps one has arrived at the summit.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the nearly 500 metre long peregrination one is recompensed in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the town, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.</seg>
<seg id="43">They provide for atmosphere, above all, however, for the right air humidity in the Literaturgebirge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"One would not believe it, but this house is a showing project as regards ecology in spite of many glass surfaces", says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Is heated and is cooled with geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the book mountain stands under a glass fall, the sun seems even on sunny days only briefly in the inside.</seg>
<seg id="48">The wide wooden glue binders who stand crosswise to the glass facade serve as a shadowing and intercept a large part of the solar irradiation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The space climate is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fully automatic shades do the rest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT branch, already ventured the way in the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Also Lisette Verhaig was there already.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde who calls the mountain Böken even Spijkenisses "long ago overdue soul".</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: Every inhabitant was invited to the opening few weeks ago to donate a book from his personal continuance.</seg>
<seg id="55">The optical gaps should be filled for the time being once with it in the not yet completely equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces-.</seg>
<seg id="56">The draught has risen.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are filled to obenhin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think, now thanks to our invitation every inhabitant has a certain respect with this new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everybody knows that his book is a Part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">And if it is only to the adornment.</seg>
<seg id="62">With it has succeeded MVRDV that king's discipline which one calls in the jargon identity endowment.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse has written history of literature.</seg>
<seg id="64">So young and ill-mannered she may also be.</seg>
<seg id="65">This is limited sometimes a point of departure for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "Germans must play bigger role"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has abstained in the vote about the admission of Palestine of the voice.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, expert for US European relations, balances Berlin with it on a narrow diplomatic degree.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">German wave: At the beginning of the week Germany had first signalled that it would be right against the application for an observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Then, however, Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza, not.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, however, Germany must be careful on account of his special respect with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time I think that it also does not support the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without being, however, too critically towards Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March, 2011 Germany has also abstained from the voice when it was a matter of furnishing a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was put through, finally, by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Is it difficult for Germany to cover a clear position with important international subjects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, this is right.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is due to the fact that it just his foreign affairs change namely away from a politics which became, so to speak, from the USA gemanaged, to German foreign affairs.</seg>
<seg id="16">Aggravatingly comes that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform politics.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are found between the fronts against.</seg>
<seg id="18">One expects from them that they play a more independent role, however, they are not accustomed to it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe, they still feel way to her role, but they are on the way to "more normal" foreign affairs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Foreign affairs, as they have France or Great Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What do "normal" foreign affairs mean then specifically from German view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">She shows the readiness to cover positions with national interests also which are independent of those of the USA or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think that the German foreign affairs are motivated by the economic policy, so from the exports and his relations with certain regions, possibly Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Economic interests of Germany are to a certain degree differently than those of the other big powers and, therefore, Germany must protect his interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Have these economic interests had influence on the position during the Middle East conflict and the vote in UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the one hand Germany has big outlets in the Middle East, particularly in the golf states.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public, but also the élites, in the Arabian countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">This plays anyway a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not want to attach also too much weight, this is no absolutely one-sided respect.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it plays anyway an important role in German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Has Germany damaged his relations with the USA, while it has abstained by important decisions of the voice, possibly by the vote over Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe, in Europe and even in the USA rules big understanding for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I do not think that this was such a dramatic break, how in the Libyan question.</seg>
<seg id="34">Maybe Germany will warm up with it even a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since, nevertheless, it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and his interests be roofed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">There are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="37">The USA against it have expressed themselves clearly for a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">On account of the American domestic policy these differences have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the government probably has quite a lot of understanding for the European position under Obama in petto.</seg>
<seg id="41">But on account of the political situation here, the government cannot represent this position publicly of course.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think that the actual differences of opinion are not so big at all as they always appear.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you have a look at the relations between Obama and prime minister Netanjahu, Obama is not at all thus hellauf enthusiastically from Netanjahu's politics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Is it difficult for Germany to agree on his close relations with Israel and the USA on one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I believe, exactly this makes it so difficultly for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">It would be of course a little bit easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European politics what is not the case currently.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they cannot be a part of a broader line and must speed up, instead, things from her own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">They make this just with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe, in future Germany will take over a leading role to push Europe to a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is not of course simply for Germany, already because of the respect with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This was always a sensitive subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I think that to the Germans is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Does Germany see itself in the role as a more importantly international player - wants Germany to take over generally a leading role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is Germany the leading role still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not accustomed yet to it, this is still disagreeable and, for evident reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we look, for example, the eurocrisis, there become every time if Germany accepts a bigger role, the most different anti-German feelings freely.</seg>
<seg id="57">This makes it to the Germans not easy.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is, actually, the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">Thus Germany is seen in a lot of more difficult position than the USA.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be receptively for the most different neighbours and opinions and this is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Now the influence of the USA decreases in the European politics continuously, the EU does not fill at the moment this vacuum, however who remains there, otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they does not like it, it is disagreeable to them and still makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Protection of trade marks" in China: If puma and Armani become Chinese sudden</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.</seg>
<seg id="3">What, however, is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind it a name quite officially registered in China which deals, however, nothing with the origin enterprises is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="5">Still she enjoys so long protection how the real name givers do not complain.</seg>
<seg id="6">And is not clear whether it is received right.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It becomes more and more difficult for foreigners to protect her brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in the office Taylor Wessing who is specified on protective law breakings in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week a new case on my desk lands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A few additional letters already reach to the imitators, so that they may announce her brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thus becomes from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada one brings in Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also German enterprises are legally copied in this manner, possibly the sports article manufacturer puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Stalemate hole opens a folder with registrations of the brand office in Peking.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the 14th of September, 2010 a Chinese enterprise let there the trade mark Zegna DF protect puma, an art name which also helped itself at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in the injured person of intellectual property, is known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big towns there are the multistoried department stores who sell almost excluding forgeries.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, stalemate hole cases are different: By order of his mandators he goes forward against the fact that Chinese enterprises from the brand office receive quite officially the right to use a name which is already protected somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call "Bang Mingpai", a front seat passenger's brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word orientates itself by "Bang Dakuan".</seg>
<seg id="19">With it the women who hook rich men are meant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities do not feel responsible for anything</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"This is damaging to business, one must fight against it", demands stalemate hole.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand is diluted, the Alleinstellung disappears, the image damage is huge."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial failures and the legal costs of the affected branches go to the millions, above all with expensive showing products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market research society CLSA China with a volume of 15 milliard euros in the year is the third-biggest market for luxury and the fastest growing one.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, deletions of dubious entries in the brand register are difficult to reach and go to the money.</seg>
<seg id="26">Up to nine years the procedure can stretch, with uncertain exit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Stalemate hole reports about cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration the complained name has become the "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff is unlucky, he must pay to the plagiarist even money because he injured his brand in China, says stalemate hole.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes there rules here the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Famous cases also concern graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">In 2009 Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, that enterprise which took over recently the German concrete pump farmer cleaning master.</seg>
<seg id="32">Therefore, the Chinese may use till this day an emblem which resembles the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue-white logo which reminded of BMW; the quarrel was settled, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who allowed to look the famous crocodile in the other direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities do not feel responsible for anything.</seg>
<seg id="36">Though the brand office CTMO in Peking admits that there have been bottlenecks there in 2010 because of too low personnel equipment and office layout.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, last year one has returned from the "emergency situation in the work routine to the normality".</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus the continuance of raw objection procedures has sunk by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">One has concluded nearly 57,000 such cases, 75 percent more than in the year before.</seg>
<seg id="40">Still 81,500 objections still wait in the office for execution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To begin against it costs a lot</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China the figures are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year came with the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for protection of trade marks, nearly one third more than 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record and means that China states for the tenth time one after the other the list of the new registrations all over the world, informs the authority.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is also valid for the continuance of all valid brand names, a total of 5.5 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011 1.8 milliard yuan have been taken in fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simplisticly this is called that every registration costs on an average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To begin against it costs a multiple how the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg points.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years the group fights against a Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Though the Germans could reach that his unlawful manufacture of artificial automobile parts was dug up.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, the imitator protected the Chinese rights in the brand Joy mountain to himself furthermore.</seg>
<seg id="52">One himself has missed this, because in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairperson of the management of joy mountain Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The brand office CTMO rejected the objection of the inhabitants of Munich also.</seg>
<seg id="54">Though in the both next authorities joy mountain agreed surely, however, the opposing party fights on till this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">One must pay attention like hell</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confident to bring the thing to a good end, and praises the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: "The procedure is extremely costly and costs us a lot of time, money and nerve."</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs can be hardly numbered, the company archive had to look through even 100 year-old acts to adduce evidences.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago joy mountain of the opposition offered in vain a "high 6-figure euroamount" to the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"One sees in it, how much to us this is worth", says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers in the Far East threaten even to Europe zurückzuschwappen.</seg>
<seg id="63">Because when to themselves there imitators protect unprotected brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thus a Chinese manufacturer wanted to announce the name Joy mountain for shoes and leather in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="65">The group has given up this business segment long ago, nevertheless, he could turn away the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"One must pay attention like hell", says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">He as well as the lawyer Pattloch advise German enterprises to be very careful by shops with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It does not manage on counting on international brand rights, rather the foreigners should announce "everything what is protection-worth anyhow also in China" as Wentzler says.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise this can become more expensive much than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">Indeed: If joy mountain is defeated in the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay of the opposition royalties for own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we are pushed in the doubtful segment from the market.</seg>

<seg id="1">World AIDS day: Stamp, sing, help</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Heidelberg the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are glad about it.</seg>
<seg id="3">The history of a connection which overcomes far more than 8733 kilometres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First is there stamping: Cowboy's boots, gym-shoes, ladies' pumps and man's slip-on shoes search the tact on the parquet floor, find him quick.</seg>
<seg id="5">Eins-zwei-drei-vier.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then only the voices of the singers slowly rise - Old, bass, tenor and soprano - press, beguile and pursue themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductors, lifts it almost from his material shoes if he brings together them with his smoothly wild gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is Monday evening, in the music space of the institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg the choir rehearses Imbongi a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">To fifty singers and female singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist up to the househusband.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om'Obani" is no easy piece, every choral voice has another text and this still into very much foreign language: The Zulu which is spoken from eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mosambique and and in parts of Swaziland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help to the self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Worldwide there are about 34 million HIV-infected, this estimates unaIDS, the programme of the United Nations to the Bekämfung of AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million people of it live in the south of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans live.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive, in the meantime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 AIDS orphans in the village Esitjeni the association has found Voices for Africa godfathers in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them visit a grammar school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros in the month one can take over a godparenthood.</seg>
<seg id="19">She guarantees for the child college fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo centre.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means on Zulu Geschichtenerzähler or also Lobpreiser.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Bantu language fluently can speak in this space nobody, but sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For nearly ten years the choir practises songs into this foreign soft language and brings back them from time to time also there where they come originally: in the south of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">Since there are 8 733 kilometres of air line of Heidelberg remotely, in the northwest of the kingdom Swaziland, the village Esitjeni which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About 2000 people live there, some still in easy mucky huts and straw huts, a large part of it are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them have no more parents because these to the hi-virus shoot are.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Esitjeni appears in the little one what completely Swaziland suffers from: the highest HIV-infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">Beschneidungen of the male foreskin which reduce the infection risk as can be proved around half are hardly accepted by the population.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus in themselves, at the middle thirty is to be died no rarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">With a common Africa trip in spring, 2005 the choir discovered the village, above all, however, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets which lacked not only parental care but simply in all: Food, clothes, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without graduation one has in a poor country only surely no chance.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the beginning it was still the private engagement of singles to send a child to the school for some euro in the year and to allow to him a warm meal on the day.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, already a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which looks since that time almost professionally after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts too sexually to transferable infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most important sexually transferable illnesses?</seg>
<seg id="36">Syphilis, Chlamydien and gonorrhea (Gonorrhö) count to the bacterial STI.</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral STI are a HIV, human Pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Crab louses and Krätze belong to the parasite's eras STI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who are the main affected person's groups?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhea seem above all with men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert Koch's institute assumes from the fact that at least four of five all syphilis cases announced in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">With the heterosexual adults Chlamydien infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (mushrooms), gonorrhea and human Pappilomaviren are often seeming sexually transferable illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spreading of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - still: About 20 percent of the HIV-new infections are cancelled to this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among youngsters Chlamydien infections appear as substantially more frequent than with other sections of the population.</seg>
<seg id="45">After European elevations three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">Besides, in this country human Pappilomaviren seem with youngsters often.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How has the number of the infections developed?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transferable illnesses are subject to registration.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of the syphilis infections has doubled according to the Robert Koch's institute of 1697 illnesses in 2001 on 3698 illnesses in 2011 more than.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of the HIV-new infections decreases since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about one tenth less than in the year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Which symptoms point to a gender illness?</seg>
<seg id="54">The infection illnesses can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort in urinating, outflow, unterstomachaches as well as vesicles or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nevertheless, often they cause no pains or other symptoms and, therefore, remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can one protect himself?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can diminish the risk of an infection, however, offer no hundred percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Since partly causes can be transmitted by sexually transferable illnesses also by infections and narrow body contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Hence, experts recommend regular investigations above all with often varying sex partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">Early diagnosed most STI can be cured and late results be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">By godparenthood, donations and not least the fees, itself the choir in the whole of Germany ersingt, gathers something.</seg>
<seg id="62">"All together we have sent quite about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the chairperson of the association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and penetration-strong woman, the money from Germany administers.</seg>
<seg id="64">She also looks after the fact that the orphans well possibly find accomodation, with one of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The Gogos, as one calls the old women on Zulu, are the props of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans with themselves, give them a roof over the head and provide for the fact that the children appear in her uniforms every day on time to the school lessons.</seg>
<seg id="67">Who has nobody more, comes to the protective house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is just paid by the association like both cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Besides, "Voices for Africa" has brought to life a Nähschule, has built two chicken houses and organised together with the American health organisation PSI that many left a HIV test in the village.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is no self-evident fact, because so obviously the illness in the whole country also is, one hushes up them best.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it deals with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Actually, strangely in a country in which the king officially keeps 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, king Mswati III, is known for his excessive life style.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Among the rest, it is also owed of this by the state sanctioned life form that the hi-virus has spread out in past decades so fast.</seg>
<seg id="76">But also to many travelling workers who carry the virus through the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">There would be free condoms though on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is another - flesh to flesh."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To promote the cultural exchange something, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years together by the south of Africa and sings the songs of full melancholy, fight mind, confidence and black self-confidence which know many by the southern corner of the black continent still from times of the apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A coach of the full white who sing songs into black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has already wrested from some fierce border guards a few tears.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The trip leads always also to Esitjeni where the singers visit her godchildren.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even if one hardly finds the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is known more than.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Goes to Esitjeni, there is the light" the people say there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And if one returns 8733 kilometres of air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the test space in the Bergheimer street, then one sees it shining also there.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The probe messenger has thought proofs of the fact that there is on the planet of Mercury Eis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The sheet of ice should possibly be up to 20 metres thick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although he lies most near the sun, there also is there frozen water how it arises from three on Thursday in the professional magazine "Science" to published studies.</seg>
<seg id="6">The probe messenger has thought proofs of the fact that there is a sheet of ice in the region constantly lying in the shade of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="7">This should be up to 20 metres thick at least 30 centimetres and possibly even.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The water presumably came from comets or possibly also asteroids which have hit on the Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nobody brings the finding of ice, however, with the existence of life on the planet in connection, said the chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.</seg>
<seg id="10">The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the findings could help in it to clear how waters and other stones of the life have reached in other areas of the solar system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Unnoticed from the mortals are probes, telescopes and small robots like phoenix to investigate the depths of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Every now and then they send pictures to the earth: Small peepholes in infinite width.</seg>
<seg id="14">The picture comes from a camera which German researchers of the Max-Planck's institute have developed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Eight planets of our solar system, moreover, the midget planet of cerium.</seg>
<seg id="16">Like Pluto which circles behind Neptune round the sun is of cerium according to the new concept definition of the international astronomical union of 2006 no "planet".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This screen window of an infrared admission of the top telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: The oldest stars are to be recognised as blue points, heavier the pink-coloured "newborn children" are to be identified in the star circle hall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This star-pedagogic region - from scientists unromantic W5 called - has discovered the telescope sharpener in the star picture Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="22">The top telescope of the NASA shot this photo of the galactic natal room.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At night the Plejaden star cluster, also "seven sisters" called, can be seen with the bare eye.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, with the telescope the colours are better effective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Like a red Age the Helix fog on this infrared photo awaits the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is 700 light years remotely in the Aquarius sign of the zodiac.</seg>

<seg id="28">A combination of normal and infrared photo provides for the spectacular colour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This baby star could be taken up in his full beauty only by the infrared detectors of the top telescope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Saturn and his rings: How these have originated, is one of the big riddles of the astronomy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Possibly they are the remains of a Saturn moon which disappeared before 4.5 milliard years without a trace.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="32">One of the biggest and most sharp admissions of the Hubble telescope: The jacuzzi galaxy</seg>

<seg id="34">Shooter shows the Trifid fog distant several thousand light years in the sign of the zodiac the admission published by the European south observatory.</seg>
<seg id="35">The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three parts, dreigespalten), there dark dust stripes the glowing heart of the star birthplace to 3 parts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the sign of the zodiac of queue bearers astronomers have taken a photo of the heralds of a cosmic cannon: 400 million light years of the earth the cores of two melting galaxies race remotely on each other to and will collide unavoidably with each other.</seg>

<seg id="46">The star cradle produces always new Youngster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Also this star cloud, linked with the rosette fog, produces constantly new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole still exists no dust, but only gas.</seg>
<seg id="49">Researchers suppose that he has originated only shortly after the big bang when in the universe mainly hydrogen was to be found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our insights in all: The most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope should have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to the star observation.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became bigger and bigger - and the insights which they deliver, deeper and deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">During 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar observatory was close San Diego the biggest telescope of the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">Spiegel, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, the USA, stands the Generous Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">It admits looks in all immediately more than two mirrors, everybody with a diameter of 8.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The inner life of the grain Telescopio Canarias on the Canaries island La Palma is gigantic - only the mirror comes on 10.4 metres in the diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Spiegel of the Southern African Generous Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter from about eleven metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">Disadvantage of the favorable construction method: The telescope is in his height corner a festival-lashed - and with it in his mobility limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Also the amateur Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the height corner.</seg>
<seg id="62">His specific feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.</seg>
<seg id="63">This comes up because - in spite of relatively low reflecting diameter - to those of the worldwide biggest reflecting telescopes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers all monitor after extraterrestrial signals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.</seg>
<seg id="66">Every computer owner can help with "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), while he makes available arithmetic achievement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Look at the observatory of the European observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here stands the Very Generous Telescope - which does all credit to his name.</seg>
<seg id="69">With his a total of four mirrors the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Also on the Chilean ESO observatory the European Extremely Generous Telescope is planned.</seg>
<seg id="71">His main mirror should enclose full 42 metres - and be composed from just 1000 reflecting elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, on pictures is to be calculated at the earliest in 2018.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Till 2007 both perky telescopes on the hawaiianischen volcano Mauna Kea were valid as the biggest ones of the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">They offer immediately two mirrors by an average of ten metres.</seg>
<seg id="75">The perky telescopes are a part of the Mauna Kea observatory which looks beside them still with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Also on the Mauna Kea a new, gigantic telescope should originate - by a reflecting average of thirty metres.</seg>
<seg id="77">Here it is to be marvelled at on an illustration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">Nevertheless, the space telescope Hubble delivers the most important impressions from all.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since the 24th of April, 1990 it already delivers pictures of distant worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March, 2009 the space telescope Kepler looks for extra-solar planets - particularly after such which are inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">On the 2nd of February, 2011 was announced by the NASA that 1235 planet candidates were determined since mission beginning.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the picture the last start preparations in the space telescope Kepler are documented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane5 rocket in all.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the duties of the telescope: It should look for light of the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume from the fact that also in the South Pole of Mercury Eis it exists.</seg>
<seg id="87">Indeed, there are for it no dependable data, because the messengers far closer on the North Pole circles round the planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements have pointed since decades to the fact that there is on Mercury Eis.</seg>
<seg id="89">Now by the messenger probe begun in 2004 - the first one which circles round the Mercury - the scientists have certainty.</seg>

<seg id="17">The incredible wealth which the country owes to his oil in the Caspian Sea has not come here in the province yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is persuaded of the fact that Lerik has the makings of the tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision song festival - and here next year we have a festival of the oldest people of the world", says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">She is the manager of the museum for longevity, probably only in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here the vita of about eight dozens Talyschen from the area is documented, older than 100. Fatulayeva points at a black-and-white photo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Here this is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the age of 136 years one more child generated</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, argumentative star of the museum is of the Schafhirte Şirali Müslümov which should have become 168 years old.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, there is not a birth certificate.</seg>
<seg id="26">And, nevertheless, in view of the oldest documented person who became 122 years old Müslümovs age seems extremely dubious.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Here in 1805 he was born in the region, in 1973 he died", explains Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man has been married three spots and has had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he should have generated one more daughter.</seg>
<seg id="29">Has miscalculated Şirali Müslümov with his age by a few decades?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But also Rembrandt village mayor, gerontologist in the Max-Planck's institute in Rostock, has belonged from the age-old in Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"There are remarkably many hochaltrige people also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan", says village mayor, "also in Sardinia many very old men live extremely".</seg>
<seg id="32">Nevertheless, because of missing documents no scientific proof about the age is to be led, particularly as personal trinkets registers were absent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Every day mug-wise molten butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">However, fact is that the people of the region reach a biblical age all around Lerik remarkably often.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the moment there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why so many age-old live here in the south?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains with the special genes of the Talyschen.</seg>
<seg id="38">Museum manager Fatulayeva against the fact thinks that it lies in the food.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, the fact that just the food rich in calorie of the Talyschen should be so healthy which love meat, bread and above all milk products and drink from those many daily a glass of molten butter, seems from food-scientific view also not quite plausible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or is it the original life-style which holds the people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">With her 97 years she is still relatively young for these widths.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva which claims to have 143 descendants lives in an easy timber house which is typical for the whole Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">She sits on the ground with a butter tub, them untiringly there and herrollt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live here under a roof, under it one of Mirzayevas to sons and a daughter, both are long ago grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also two toddlers jump around.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen one prepares for the guests the tea which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Mirzayevas white teeth stand perfectly in lining up and limb, under her headscarf she hides the long, dark-blond plaits which her son reveals proudly before us.</seg>
<seg id="48">I have washed my hair always with milk, they never went out to me and kept her colour.</seg>
<seg id="49">"I have also never used shampoo", says Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Monthly pension reaches to the life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">She has eaten always only this what came of her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">Long I have bought my whole life not once at the supermarket food.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then she tells about her man who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">It was worst in the time after the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, everything became better than the "beloved father" took over Heydar Aliyew the oar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The propaganda sounds strangely from the mouth of an old woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the cult which is done around the father-figure of the nation which governed his country like a dictator hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Till 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the oar.</seg>
<seg id="59">At least, there is no need among old people of Azerbaijan.</seg>
<seg id="60">230 Manat (possibly the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local relations an amount on which one can well live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And maybe longest hoary son is right also Mirzayevas: "The old people enjoy respect in our culture."</seg>
<seg id="62">They live in the midst of the great family, are loved, looked and are happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">If this is no reason to stay alive as long as possible</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">However, what is called "principles"?</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most stinking fish of the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and this not only in Europe, but in the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Could the secret behind a success of the country something deal with the local appetite for quite stinking fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">One takes a choice of overripe cheese kinds.</seg>
<seg id="5">One places them in the midst of a heap of dirty, humid sports clothes.</seg>
<seg id="6">And if she leaves there one week.</seg>
<seg id="7">So about one must fancy the nasal-deafening smell of Rakfisk, one of the big delicatessen of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is here snow, spectacular sceneries - and this stubborn smell in the air which simply does not want to disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is with salt a strewed trout who becomes - dependent of it, how stinking one would have his fish with pleasure - up to a year in water fermentiert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">If in Norway the darkness about the country comes and the weather becomes colder, Norwegians flow out to a party here in Fagernes which is dedicated to this, now, really very fascinating speciality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"One eats it raw and rinses it then with a glass Aquavit down", says Havard Halvarsen which works, actually, in the local fire station, but when so-called "Rakfisk general" also organises the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Round us people consume small fish cubes and take in addition large amounts in alcohol to themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"To mush people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk", says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The spirit can edge out the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I cost some morsels.</seg>
<seg id="17">If one avoids bringing the Rakfisk in nasal nearness, he is not bad - possibly like sushi which has a rather long bus ride behind itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of quite an other, by far poorer Norwegian epoch than there were still no chill possibilities and fish was watered in autumn in airtight saltwater barrels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then in the dead of winter he was taken out after long Fermentierung and - certainly under senses subdued help of alcohol - consumed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Still one generation ago thousands of Norwegians in search of work felt constrained to leave her country and emigrated primarily in the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Today the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing job market, high wages and a comprehensive health service.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even of Sweden, the old rival who was by far richer before not yet much too long time than Norway flow out immigrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is looked as something important - as essential, even if strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history.</seg>
<seg id="24">He belongs to the more expensive courts which one can buy to himself here.</seg>
<seg id="25">But here, actually, everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not create it often in the world press, and this does not seem to disturb most people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here one still hates it to call different Breivik with the name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children the last year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, one refers only to the "incident from the 22nd of July".</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegians do themselves hard to accept that somebody is able in her peaceful country too such to crude murders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Responsibly for head for the today's wealth of Norway is since the early 1970s years the growth of one of the biggest oil industries and gas industries of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason, why it goes well to us so", says Anna, our waitress who distributes round trays with ripe Rakfisk and embodies with her long blond hair and the piercing blue eyes the northern ideal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are - like one says - circumspect people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their English is exact like of most people here flawlessly.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are not very braggart, we like no boastfulness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has handled with his oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the branch yields is invested cheers future generations in a special fund.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When during the years up to the worldwide economic crisis everybody threw with money around themselves which they did not own at all, Norway held his change purse firmly close.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can go skiing in winter and be a matter walking in summer, we are happy", says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And of course Rakfisk eat", it adds with lighthearted laughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I stand in the snow and act for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">So an Elch-Burger is anyway something else. The juicy meat tastes good to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But in the evening stands again of the Stinkefisch on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel at which I stay is one of several venues which organise a Rakfisk dinner, with the guest for the best - or maybe the sences of smell strongest challenging - fish can be right.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a live TV circuit to a show master dressed in fly which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="44">The spectacle resembles the Eurovision song contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Which score do you have there on top in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here are our points, Havard".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">One claps and laughs.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls from his chair, beaten possibly from the Aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">But, nevertheless, maybe it is the strict smoke of the whole fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico stands before difficult start</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While future president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto on his assumption of office prepares, analysed wanting Grant of the BBC the challenges approaching him and the mixed feelings of his people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Topically the traffic is particularly bad in Mexico town.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even on better days is this one always congested town, however, on Monday a ring of steel was established which blocks off several important traffic routes in the capital and provides on the streets for chaos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless, the aim was not to disturb commuter on the way to work, but to hinder demonstrators, to reach the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bandage and take over the guidance of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He stands before a complicated job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Under the parting government Felipe Calderons Mexico could prove itself economically well, however, the country is in the clutch of a drug war which has already cost 60,000 human lives during the last six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government is strongly involved to reduce the power", explained Pena Nieto in the beginning of this week in the oval office to the US-American presidents Barack Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will suggest a new security strategy with which we can achieve this aim.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he went with the US-president on eye level, Pena Nieto acted as a governor of his mother country Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this close settled, extensive part of the country which surrounds the capital the opinions about the new head of state are divided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A direct man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the remote provincial town of Valle del Bravo! one remembers, for example, with pleasure him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Inhabitants of the holiday place ascribe the development of the tourism and the construction of the infrastructure to him.</seg>
<seg id="16">To reach the town, one can go on one of the highways, the Pena Nieto allowed to build and one big improvement compared with the fragile, rough streets explain which there were here once.</seg>
<seg id="17">Badges with his name also hang beyond a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum to the climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect from him real and persistent changes", according to his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez who works as a congressman for the party of Pena Nietos, the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular what concerns the security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change which needs our country so urgently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years in power it was removed the PRI in 2000 from Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">The congressman Olvera admits that the party puts big expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto after 12 years beyond the presidential palace of lot Pinos.</seg>
<seg id="22">The reproaches of the opposition, to the new president there is not enough substance, he declines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He is a very direct man, very much engages and has big plans for the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is an excellent statesman, however, above all he is also somebody who can listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the state many people do not divide this view about her former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also famously as a Ciudad Neza, the contrast could not be bigger to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo!.</seg>
<seg id="27">The place lies hidden under autooverpasses and shows in many respects a suburb of Mexico town itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the municipality are from decisively urbane nature.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the beginning of this year the military was switched on to fight against the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and power against women is an especially acute problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On a spot fallow land near a big garbage dump the corpses of dutzender murdered women were left behind only during the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the term of office of governor Pena Nieto more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state Mexico - a statistics which even those of the city of Ciudad Juarez excels which is infamous for her power and the murders of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The critics Pena Nietos are of the view that he has approached the problem of the women's murders during his term of office at least not appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, in the worst case his government has closed her eyes before the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete structure, typically for the dilapidated quarter, Irinea Buendia with the tears fights when she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.</seg>
<seg id="35">Of the official version of the events according to Mariana committed in 2010 suicide.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, her family thinks that it was murdered by her lifelong companion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I came with her at home, it seemed as if her body has been washed", remembers Senora Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">There was sign that it was hit, and the rigour mortis had already started.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks from the wall at us down. It is right beside a cross which carries one single word: Justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, till present exactly this, according to the family, one has kept her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The authorities have treated me as if I am a chatterbox, troublemaker, troublemaker.</seg>
<seg id="42">They would want that one simply accepts her judgment and shuts up.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But this is not possible if there were so many irregularities and omissions", she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">If president Pena Nieto receives the presidential bandage on Saturday, he takes over with it also a big responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Ten thousands Mexican families were affected during the last six years by violent crime, and the new president has promised to look during his term of office particularly after this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope, as a president he is in such a way as he was as a governor", says the PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo!.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, exactly before it the families of the victims are afraid in Ciudad Neza mostly.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The defence aims at a refusal of the accusation on account of too hard prison conditions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">To the Gefreiten of the US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The public prosecutor's office has tried on Friday to find out that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - accused for the biggest exposure of confidential information of the US-American history - missed several opportunities to complain to the maltreatment supposedly suffered by him in military custody.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With a cross-examination Mannings during a prejudicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden Well that documents had carried out for weekly visits, the prison official during Mannings of 9-month custody time in Quantico, Virginia no discomfort upon his treatment showed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">One day before the cross-examination which was held as a result of an application of the defence to the refusal of the accusation - Manning has been punished by the hard custody time already enough - Manning had stated, he would have considered the suicide in the prison.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">To the Secret Service analyst of the US army who was arrested in June, 2010 is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents during his business hours in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the material was published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a spring of the information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In the hearing on Friday Well went through with Manning the forms which officials had filled after her meetings with Manning during his custody in the Quantico-military prison where he had served a sentence from July, 2010 to April, 2011 under reinforced prison conditions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The officials put Manning questions and wrote down his answers.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Well questioned him on Friday about the forms, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the equipment all together as "very professional".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms, thus Well, contained no discomfort upon maltreatment, although the employed Manning had conferred with directly about his treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning answered, he has expressed his doubts orally and the officials would have discussed this with him and would have indicated to deal with these. Nevertheless, they have not been taken down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"You wrote down "No problems" (after discussion of the doubts), and meant not necessarily that I said generally nothing", according to Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The judge, colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning, why he did not complain to his treatment when he met in January, 2011 a committee which should examine mentioned suicide thought from him some months before on a form.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning answered, his intention during this meeting has consisted in letting his observation status to the "prevention of injuries" herabstufen.</seg>
<seg id="20">The military stated, it has to him this restrictive status - which stands a step under the suicide danger - to his and the protection more different assigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted to persuade employee of the fact that it went well to me, and the observation status to the prevention of injuries get rid (...) around a quality of life higher from my view to be able to reach", said Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Manning stated on Thursday for his arrest and transfer to Kuweit where he was held on roughly two months, before he was moved in July, 2010 in the prison of the naval base Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He said, in Kuweit he has considered the suicide and has become unconscious on account of the heat once.</seg>
<seg id="24">Not to be allowed to know what happens with him or in the outside world, has been incriminating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"My world shrivelled on camp Arafjon, on this cage", said Manning on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="26">I thought, I would die in this cage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">When he was moved to Quantico, Manning has spent the large part of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.</seg>
<seg id="28">One has permitted to him only one mattress, a cover, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">Manning said, he has tried to remain in movement, because on the day it has been forbade, to sleep or even to lie down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Always he had to sleep with the light which penetrated from the outside into his cell.</seg>
<seg id="31">If at night he has turned round and guards could not see his face any more, one has woken him, so that he turns back himself again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In January, 2011 Mannings lawyer raised formally objection against the treatment Mannings.</seg>
<seg id="33">In April, 2011 Manning was moved in the military prison by fort Leavenworth, Kansas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">On Friday the judge Manning also conferred with about an accusation which he had raised in his statement on Thursday - he has one night in the nude in his cell in Quantico must sleep and stand with an early morning counting in the nude before alert and other prisoner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Manning had stated, he has never had during this counting the opportunity to wrap up himself in his cover.</seg>
<seg id="36">While questioning on Friday Manning bragged, he has closed for an order of his guard that he should drop the cover with which he could have covered himself. Nevertheless, he admitted that him nobody had requested to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On Thursday Manning had stated that he was made at the previous night sleep in the nude. He would have tried before to show to an official that he shows no danger for himself.</seg>
<seg id="38">Manning has said the official, he could have used alliance of his underpants or his flip flops to injure himself, this, nevertheless, not done.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">At this night, so Manning stated, his underpants, flip flops and glasses from his cell have been removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">His lawyers hope that the judge at least will consider his custody experiences and drastically reduce his custody measure, he should be condemned at his negotiations before the military court. This is attached for the beginning of the next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The defence has given that Manning confesses of lower offences for guilty, while the other charges which are considered as too extreme should be contested.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The continuation of the hearing is attached for this week-end. A justification of the prison conditions is expected from the public prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Pentagon remains with his position that Manning was held on according to the regulations which are valid for everybody under the highest safety measures in Quantico for kept prisoners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">To the charges against Manning count the furtherance of the enemy, wrongful publication of secret service information on the Internet, the transference of national defensive information and the theft of public property or documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">If he is found in all charges guilty, a lifelong prison sentence threatens him.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My Mexican-American identity crisis.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Many people are forced on account of the missing chances to leave Mexico</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they call to them heavy times in the memory, he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette takes the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a kürzlichen trip to Mexico town I had crossed scarcely the hall and had come in the passport check when desperation spread in me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there during some seconds uncertainly, to which I should proceed.</seg>
<seg id="8">I have grown up in Zentralkalifornien and my whole life was called long "Mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">An ethnic abbreviation - just, as my friends are called in Boston "Irishmen" or my friends in New York "Italian".</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I decided on "Mexican American".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But here this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the native country of my grandfather there was no need for Kürzeln or hyphens.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just an American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself into this language at both ends of an interview.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not dispose of the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I also do not get rid of my American accent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my American passport and positioned myself in the queue for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about that moment of this week when the future Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet president Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda stood all those subjects which one expects if the heads of these both countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto was also interested very much to speak of the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for the fact that Mexicans remain nowadays with as high likelyhood in Mexico instead of emigrating in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would like to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and create a North American commercial block according to model of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he called concerning this no details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Relation of Mexico to the United States is complicated and full resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans presumably never waste one single thought of the fact that the United States occurred in 1848 in Mexico and made the guidance of the country under reproached gun leave to them more than half of her territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for the Mexicans who think during centuries and not during minutes recollections of this event are not to be overlooked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As soon as an US government official practises even the mildest criticism to Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and under the élites of the country - discomfort upon how the Americans press the sovereignty of her neighbouring country.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children Montezumas proceed on the warpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And, nevertheless, the biggest challenge of Mexico lies in truth in the respect with the more than 35 millions Mexican Americans who live in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Desire to speak of resentments?</seg>
<seg id="29">There is more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has winner and loser. The people for whom the country offers chances, and others for which it this does not act.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason, why so many people of Mexican origin live in towns like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, consists in the fact that in a point in our family tree a person - maybe a parent or grandparent's part - got no chance in Mexico compulsory and emigrated in the direction of the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - swarthy, ill-mannered, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is valid for them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And although we live maybe now the American dream, good schools have visited and have received good jobs, we may never lose out of sight that it is the American dream which we live - not the Mexican one.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity has sometimes become blurred possibly, but what concerns our loyalty, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is valid unambiguously for the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we are aware that to us many members of the Mexican ruling class may not.</seg>
<seg id="39">This is based on mutuality.</seg>
<seg id="40">They look down to us as a memorial of a mortifying defeat and look at us because we are Mexican enough not.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish becomes never good enough, our gang to Mexico be never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">In your opinion our existence is a symbol of the failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And now then we would not feel behind the silk curtain caught - with a pleasant life lost in the United States, but anyhow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My woman who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated as a child legally in the United States reminds me of the fact that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions exist because Mexicans own a clearer image about who they are - and Mexican Americans take amiss them of this.</seg>
<seg id="46">While she is an US-American citizen, she sees herself as a part of two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, many Mexican Americans whom I know have the feeling to belong neither on the one hand nor to the other country.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the Mexican tape lot Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">One enjoys the best of both worlds, has rooted, however, in none of it.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we are seen as an American.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we are seen as a Mexican.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">How I should learn during my trip, there is something which makes this respect still more complicated: Some Mexican leadership people and parts of the educated classes would like to resume her connections with the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico who represent her interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American colleague about how great a visit of this country is and pressure on the political guidance exercise to intensify her connections to Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Now.</seg>
<seg id="56">This will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many injured feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the unrestrained corruption and the drug power many of us are not sure at all in such a way whether it really concerns a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I fear, there you have to go alone by, Amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">This is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not ready yet to award to the United States for the contact with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans look after a rancour for how her members of the family were treated only before not at all so long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Maybe we are "Mexican" when I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old battles, the new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could turn out unexpected mainstay for the peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can there one day be persistent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The newest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the midst of the usual apportionings of blame countless buildings were razed to the ground, more than 140 Palestinians, most of it civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time have smashed rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem caught during her historical conflict, the Middle East changes round them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arabian spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become a part of this confusion.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe this will lead only to more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons for the acceptance that the deadly deadlock could come, finally, to her end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war which is neither lost nor is won</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first sight optimism in view of the topical situation seems anything but right.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the armistice agreed on the 21st of November stops, the dieswöchigen fights have strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of the Hamas, the Islamic movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007 will claim himself to have forced back the Israelis, although his grouping itself had to register big losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are penned up in one of the most wretched and close populated Estonian corners of the planet, till present Israel has not succeeded in destroying the Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Really gains the Hamas in West Bank which is controlled by the rivaling, temperate Palestinian group Fatah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">And the Hamas leaders could come in the end that they have the time on her side.</seg>
<seg id="17">So how islamists have won in the Arabian world in influence, could pull the Hamas mighty and rich friends on her side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a regaining strength, regional power which was valid once as Israel of the narrowest Muslim allies has seized for the Hamas party - exactly like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic golf states.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rejoicing Hamas followers think that around Israel an Islamic half moon forms - from Lebanon in the north where militant Hizbollah has the power, over Syria where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren coinage could stand before the Stürzung Bashar Assads, up to Jordan where Hamas ally threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And in particular the rise of the Moslem's brotherhood under president Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - to the most important Arabian country inhabitant-strongest by far - in the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region with lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the laizistische despot who governed Egypt up to his fall in 2011 during 30 years had only little time for the Hamas, for the rest.</seg>
<seg id="22">By contrast the brotherhood with the Hamas verschwägert and her leaders is stronger dependent on national views.</seg>
<seg id="23">At future diplomatic negotiations could turn out the Hamas as an actor who himself cannot become from Israel and the United States herausgedrängt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">However, the Israeli hard liners infuse an opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">Military is seen the Hamas no more danger.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron of cathedrals", could prove itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">At least for a while long Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic regard the United States stick steadfast to her position. Many European countries have held responsible the Hamas for the newest Gewalteskalationen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Israel has well gone out it during the last years, in particular under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu who has ignored the peace process to large parts.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively freely from suicide assassins - not least thanks to the locking arrangements, in West Bank and with it in the main part of any Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements which were explained though for against international law, however, on and on are developed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Netanyahu well stands there. His Likud party has formed an alliance in the approach of the elections on the 22nd of January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even more combative group.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why also these underhand Palestinians pamper and leave to them own state?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they really had the control of West Bank, would they fire then not exactly like her comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip also rockets?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, it is better to keep in check them behind the wall and to punish, they should dare to lift the heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Maybe the hard liners will be able to assert themselves. However, the Arabian spring could foil them.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the islamists who sit now in Egypt and in other countries in power have a little for Israel, for the rest, they will concentrate first upon the difficulties in own country.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defensive budget of Israel is bigger than of his four Arabian neighbours together.</seg>
<seg id="38">A war with the local superpower will help the new Arabian governments hardly in the repair of her economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The fact that the pragmatic president Mursi with Barack Obama got together to reach an armistice, a promising sign could be - and symbolise maybe the beginning of a new era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also Israelis should think more in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the remaining Arabian world takes timid steps in the direction of democratisation, Palestinians are robbed furthermore of her self-determination right - a powder keg which will explode certainly one day in the Israeli occupied areas, exactly how this week a coach exploded in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">By now the suppression undermines the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arabian population this situation will only intensify.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bloody missions to the Zurückdrängung of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand about the years increasingly her diplomatic tribute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need an impulse from the outside</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The right answer is that which will represent from the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the large part of the remaining world and from this newspaper: Two states with which Israel resigns areas for security purposes.</seg>
<seg id="46">- for the close future small - hope consists in the fact that the armistice grants to outsiders more influence for the penetration of this solution.</seg>
<seg id="47">Now Egypt must stop together with Turkey and Qatar the deliveries of arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before, around the Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on basis of the borders of 1967, complements with area exchange and common Jerusalem to be convincing.</seg>
<seg id="48">Outstanding Arabian nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to an arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="49">With it would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming application for UN observer status.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Also Obama must serve his part to move Israel to negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term of office he missed the image of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Far away in the white house it seems as if he was declined also a participation.</seg>
<seg id="53">However, this is an unfortunate, shortsighted perspective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States have an essential interest in the stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">And if a peace agreement belongs to it between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging come into force</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Health warnings and ill body parts on the neutral green packets which are same for all tobacco brands</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The worldwide first laws for uniform cigarettes and tobacco packaging are come into force in Australia. With it brand logos and colours are substituted with neutral, olive-green lids which are printed, in addition, with drastic pictures which ill body parts and show ill babies and children by cigarette smoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">From the different health warnings and pictures once seen the only difference exists from the next Saturday between the packets in the trade name which are printed in identical, small writing.</seg>
<seg id="5">With it Australia introduces the worldwide strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from the smoking, while the glamorous picture of the tobacco consumption is removed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Besides, the government goes out from studies which have shown that the people who have not started with 26 yet smoking will not start with 99 %-iger likelyhood also afterwards any more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"One can already see with children of young age that they understand the message, the tobacco groups with her brand picture try to promote", according to federal health minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies which have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Although Australia shows one of the slightest smoker's rates of the world and the changes will affect only slightly the profits of the multinational groups, other countries already consider similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is said so, with the laws black market trade would be favoured what leads to cheaper and lighter accessible cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chinese and Indonesian forgers will offer by far larger amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other, however, say that the laws have started her business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family enterprise, marks that the inquiry for cigarette cases and silicone lids have terrifically risen to the cover of the intolerable packaging, since the groups of British American Tobacco, Britain's failed Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago most highly Australian court of law with her challenge of the laws.</seg>
<seg id="16">Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale firms and waits for new supplies.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us this is a good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to expert the hook lies in the popularity of social media with the exactly section of the population at which the plan is directed.</seg>
<seg id="19">A row of Australian laws has exiled tobacco groups from the TV advertisement, has prohibited it them to appear as sports sponsors and to lay out most traders in addition constrainedly, cigarettes in shops no longer. Now the tobacco advertisement is changed on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government has forbade Internet advertisement by local enterprises and sides, nevertheless, owns no influence on international sides.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Who markets tobacco and has only one small area, for the rest to promote his products, does not come round round the Internet", says Becky Freeman, researcher in the health service at the university of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has ascertained an increase in progress reports to the brands which were written by "quite normal people".</seg>
<seg id="23">One must put the question to himself: Is this only a private individual who thinks to so big fallen in Marlboro cigarettes that she takes up for it even a video - or does a marketing agency deal with it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry concentrates instead of upon marketing to argue with the new laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">She has gone even so far of paying the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest the new regulations - those countries complain at the World Trade Organisation to unfair commercial restrictions, although none of the countries pursues bigger trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">A WTO decision is expected for the middle of 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Plibersek the government has carried on conversations with the other countries which consider similar packaging laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was in 2001 the first country which prescribed photographic warnings.</seg>
<seg id="29">Meanwhile these were expanded on more than 40 countries, under it Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many Australian smokers are defiant.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pictures do not influence me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I simply ignore them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"One simply takes a spring and puts away the box", says Victor El Hage by the purchase of a cigarette box on which a photo with an oral tumour is printed.</seg>
<seg id="35">To tell the truth, there is only one reason, why I would stop, and this is my small girl.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored also sometimes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours in the airport when our airplane fell out on account of mechanical problems and we had to wait for another airman.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had enough time to make to myself a few thought boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I do not want to lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">To wait half a day at the airport at a flight, is quite nerve-killing - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But more and more graduates and child development experts state boredom than some positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">If it goes after them, it is okay for us - and our children - is occasional to be bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">With it the brain is made lose itself in interesting lines of thought what possibly promotes the creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because most from us stare nowadays almost constantly at the one or other screen, the advantages of the boredom are not of benefit for us any more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Should we welcome the boredom with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">I come back to it once again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">How many people also I have always assumed from the fact that boredom is a relatively topical phenomenon which has developed with increasing spare time.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and Roman history at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of "boron cathedral: A Lively History" (Yale University Pressing, in 2011) does not see this in such a way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Really the boredom has a very long history", he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">Latin graffiti about boredom which decreases to the first century adorn the house walls of Pompeii.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then is there still the question as we define boredom, actually.</seg>
<seg id="19">John D. Eastwood, a related professor of the psychology at the university of York in Ontario, according to Canada the problem consists in the fact that boredom has defined in all sorts of kinds and has been discussed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the end, that to want to exercise boredom as the experience, "an adequate activity to themselves not to be able to do this, however" allows to define.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom differs from apathy therefore from that point of view that the person is not occupied, however, this would want his.</seg>
<seg id="22">With the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The key experience of the boredom, he says, insists in a "disturbance of the attention process, combined with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes only slowly".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can as sound with it almost as depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But professor Eastwood believes, although these both states could stand in connection, bored people see the problem in her surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we think that to us is dull, even if we have only difficulties to concentrate.</seg>
<seg id="27">In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German possibly: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention" which appeared in September in the technical periodical "Perspectives on Psychological Science", wise professor Eastwood and his colleagues on a former experiment with which participants listened to a tape on which a person read out a magazine article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring space which dealt nothing with the contents. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was hardly discernible, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The people who heard the hardly audible television indicated to feel more boredom than both other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could find for this no reason and ascribed her difficulties of the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If one tries to concentrate upon a difficult or strenuous job, the disturbance of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, related professor for neuro sciences at the university of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">If one, however, a monotonous activity exercised - "as well as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, can deflect music and help to feel not bored".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Really, so he says, now we know that Herumzappeln and scrawling, often interprets as a token for boredom, these can even fight, while people remain physically attentive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Studies have shown that children, herumhampeln are allowed, learn more and keep more information than those which are forced for sitting still", according to professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">To us to all an especially tiresome film becomes sometime once dull - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people are lighter bored than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale to the boredom susceptibility" in the 1980s.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On the scale statements are found like "Many things which I must do, recur and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of such scales researchers have found out that to boy becomes more often dull than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the university of Westflorida - in particular what concerns the need after more and a bigger variety of external charms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But generally teenagers are a quite drawn heap.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991 Reed Larson, professor carried out for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment with which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and her parents from seven to eight spots on the day with a Pager.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found out that 32% of the adolescents were bored at school and while doing the homework, while 23% indicated to be bored if they were not at school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">However, only 3% of the parents indicated to feel bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Today professor Larson says, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages have risen concerning the boredom or have sunk.</seg>
<seg id="44">Nevertheless, he is sure that "the youth is felt as especially dull", primarily because children and teenagers have no big influence on her everyday expiry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Back to my origin question: Is boredom healthy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because in the extreme case she leads to the fact that people undertake extreme physical risks and go to ruin the game of chance or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the respect between boredom and creativity. Of this opinion is professor Vodanovich who investigates the subject for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"With the boredom the brain wants to say one that one should do something else", according to Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the university of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain not always knows what one should do just best of all.</seg>
<seg id="50">If is dull and one uses this energy to play the guitar and to cook, one becomes happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, at short notice though television can provide for feelings of happiness, these evaporate in the long term, however, again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Who reaches to his bored child iPad, it can dissuade with it though from the boredom. Nevertheless, it has not learnt with it to talk or to control, says professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And he adds: "Self-control spreads from a situation to other".</seg>
<seg id="54">The child learns not only to talk, but also receives in other areas more self-control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think that we should celebrate boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also we should not see them too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead, our aim should consist in feeling fine to us also off the constant activity and technology irrigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"It sounds in such a way as if had to be more often dull to us. But boredom is the tantalising, incessant wish to do something sensible", he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">He thinks that the people look in truth only for a way, to switch off and to relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In surroundings in which we become constantly überstimuliert it is difficult to deal if the noise has fallen silent once."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marihuana law</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The 19-year-old Community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court which will be soon legal in this state: The possession of some marihuana lumps and a whistle with which he smoked this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">According to Orozco he and some friends were on the move on one September day by the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officer marihuana had found in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug utensils - the gentleman's offences which are provided in each case with a punishment of 100 US dollars - and received a court appointment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are treated like criminals", according to Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, is he also one?</seg>
<seg id="7">During the uncertain weeks according to the decision of the state to legalise tiny amounts of marihuana to the own use the answer hangs with hundreds of smaller drug offences of less of the law, than from the location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of the breaches of the law which turn on marihuana, are already dropped here and in Washington which approved similar measures.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police authorities pursue adults more than 21 years no longer for possession in small measure. This is permitted legally, as soon as the new laws come into force during the next weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced to follow up existing marihuana offences and still cite people in court.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time several towns vote, from the suburbs of Denver up to the western Mountains to hinder new, state licensed marihuana shops in the opening in her municipalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This situation develops so fast that I do not know at all what will happen as a next one", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora which lies to the east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">And also regulation authorities in the federal state Washington scratch helplessly in the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They wait for a guidance to the equipment of a licence system of the production, production, the distribution and the sales of the drug - and, besides, have a term up to the 1st of December, 2013 before eyes.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Washington one takes the view that Colorado is in every case to most states ahead what concerns the regulation by marihuana. There the drug was legalised only for medical purposes and then to the own consumption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a stronger adjusted market. Hence, the state is well suited to the orientation", says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the supervisory authority for spirits in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Smith also admits that no more place or system can act, than to serve for the purposes of a coarse guide.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedence which we can follow", he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on the 6th of December and forms with it also the terminator point of a grey area in which the state licence system does not exist though yet, but the possession is legalised.</seg>
<seg id="20">And disagreeable practise questions must be cleared in this time - possibly as the state default of an "adequate access" to licensed marihuana should be agreed with the ban of cannabis shops in the vicinity of 300 metres around schools, parks, to playgrounds and care of children facilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It will nowhere be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in cities, in particular in the conurbation of Seattle", Ben Livingston, speaker for the "centre for Legally means cannabis", a recently educated research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On the 21st of November Chief Oates sent to his employees in Aurora e-mail in which he explained, the public prosecutor would pursue smaller marihuana offences with people more than 21 years no longer, and that the police will aim "from now on" at no charges for these offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates added that the police will put through furthermore urban default to the regulation of peasants of medical marihuana and drug dealer furthermore would be pursued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld county in the north of Colorado district public prosecutor Ken Buck represents a stricter opinion.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote he bragged, his authority would pursue cases of marihuana possession furthermore primarily, in order to move consumers to the denial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Topically 119 people must be summoned in court for the possession of about 50 grammes or less marihuana, although many were also accused for other offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our authority has the duty to pursue offence by which it concerned at the action time criminal offences", Buck let in an explanation announce.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions are even at places like the rural Mesa a county where voters rejected the marihuana initiative, conflicting.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the biggest town of the administrative district, indicates adults for the possession tiny amounts no longer.</seg>
<seg id="30">District public prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, however, resolved also to drop not all back possession procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not think that I waste my time to put through the right, until it changes", he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55% of the voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear right from the start that it would not be easy to agree on the personal consumption of marihuana with the complexities of government and judicial system.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the contradictory reactions in the whole state promoted a radical conflict in view of the big green experiment by days among local officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">With district public prosecutors it concerns a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents in court standing defendants for marihuana offences and operates on site as a speaker for the national organisation to the reform of marihuana laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"You have spent a so large part of her life to pursue people for the fact criminal that they cannot accept the legalisation yet", he thinks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When the first states which treat tiny amounts of marihuana like alcohol are traded Colorado and Washington as national pattern cases for the legalisation by drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">During advocates and civil servants to themselves for an age of legal sales prepare, they wait at the same time also nervously on instructions of the Federal Government which wants to treat the sales and the cultivation of marihuana at the national level furthermore as a criminal offence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give way.</seg>
<seg id="39">In spite of several sensational arrests of consumers and shop assistants of medical marihuana the Federal Government has permitted the sales of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to the large part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Kevin A. Sabet, former drug politics adviser of the Obama's government takes the view that detectives will stamp though probably in no doors to confiscate tiny amounts of the drugs, however, will presumably struggle to tolerate the by the state adjusted marihuana shops legal under the new legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several towns in Colorado do not wait only at all for the fact that the federal authorities act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Still before the election day some local local governments approved moratoria for new marihuana shops, although these could open only in about one year.</seg>
<seg id="43">The last week Montrose, a town decided in the west, a 6-month ban which is presumably dismissed the next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We would not like to get in a position with which we licence somebody and stand then at the national level before a big problem", according to Bob Nicholson, member of the town council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our municipality has been right against this law change.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are directed afterwards on what the municipality has decided and has not decided afterwards, on what the state.</seg>
<seg id="47">Many questions are still open.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: I became from Oxford gemobbt because I am Tory</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only university students from today are attacked for her views</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Always it had been my biggest dream to receive a place at the university of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">My father as well as my older brother had visited that university which I held once for the biggest knowledge stamp of the world, for a modern Greek symposium which promoted the big columns of the civilisation - free thinking and tolerance-.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, within two weeks after my move in the Worscester college in the end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and thus had caused the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father broke down in tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the Evening standard one said, I would have gone because I would have had a problem with the fact that fellow students had sex in the neighbouring room.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author A N Wilson explained roguishly, I would have left the university because I was made drink from damaged cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However, the truth was less entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not possibly on account of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">One had on me only for reason harassed - a reason which seemed so more purblind in this supposed cradle of the enlightenment and crueler: My meanwhile late father Woodrow Wyatt had been important adviser Margaret Thatcher and me advocate of the conservative party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why do I mention this just now?</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, according to topical reports a new generation of students of the temperate rights suffers from similar pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The organised and rising hatred on Tory student in Oxford has developed meanwhile such dimensions that a group of them the last week demanded the same equal rights protection, the gays, disabled person and ethnic minorities is of benefit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the junior Common Room (JCR) of the body of Christ college brag, they are isolated on account of her political views "often actively, are attacked personally and explained for undesirable".</seg>
<seg id="19">They demand a place in the equal rights committee of her college to make sure that her opinions can be freely expressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Her situation was aggravated by a recently emitted documentation about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories as an eccentric and neo-Nazis showed.</seg>
<seg id="21">In it was shown under other graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student union of the university of Oxford who went in Rolls Royce and showed off with silvery suit and silver-occupied walking floor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities say conservative students, they are looked as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".</seg>
<seg id="23">The 20-year-old hatches Black, vice president of the conservative student union of the university of Nottingham, let in a Sunday newspaper announce: "There is a growing link trend at universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people believe, we are a club like the Bullingdon without having become acquainted generally".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21 and historical student in body of Christ who initiated the request for bigger protection takes the view, such a climate is "disagreeable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designate president of the conservative student union of Oxford says, she has observed a growing refusal towards students of the temperate rights with JCR members.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This shows a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members", she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In my first weeks in Oxford I belonged to such a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">As incredibly shy 18-year-old I had come in September, 1986.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred on the conservative party had reached his high point.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the year before the university had been right to lend no honourary title to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - on the basis of shortenings in the university being.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would let even have startled Stalinisten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the first-year student's week with which new students become acquainted and the tutors I received a foretaste on the future events.</seg>
<seg id="33">I made the experience that the tutors tolerated the derision of Tory students not only, but even with joys took part in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political subjects like the miner's strike, the privatisation and the refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found her way in the wooden-panelled rooms of the seminar.</seg>
<seg id="35">With mine first of these events I should translate French texts from the 18th century into the English. On that what should come then I had not been caught.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (meanwhile lately), "you translate please the first sales".</seg>
<seg id="37">Besides, I tripped.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt was a small man with a face like from cake dough, and quite abusively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Do refuse Thatcher's followers to learn French, or are they just silly?", he asked me.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students giggled.</seg>
<seg id="41">In my eyes tears boiled up.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that they take a few French hours - in your spare time if you are not occupied too much with your social activities", growled me Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned with hanging head in my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">In this evening I sat in the college alone with the dinner when me somebody easily tapped on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was an English student from the second year called James who fancied as a member of the conservative student union.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are", he said friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it is as it is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Everybody which is suspected of being Tory is pestered.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is quite bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, therefore, it will be worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most Tory first-year students pretend to be followers of the Labour Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In a local pub I tried later to pretend.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted on the fact that I was not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick should turn out fruitless.</seg>
<seg id="54">A university entrant in the field Philosophy, Politics and Economy who had visited ironically as conservatively valid Eton college said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist's pig".</seg>
<seg id="55">You have got dirty.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students divided his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverted and filthy.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How do Tories sex have?", one asked me.</seg>
<seg id="59">They fight mutually, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt in such a way as homosexual had to have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">Would I ever succeed in leading a normal life at the university of Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Would be I able to meet like-minded people only after burglary of the darkness?</seg>
<seg id="63">Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclinations must suppress?</seg>
<seg id="64">Three years which lay before me stretched before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of the proscription and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only tutor who gave to recognise himself openly as a Tory was Norman Stone, professor for contemporary history who had his seat in my college.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had discussed Thatcher in the matter of foreign affairs and had written for them talking.</seg>
<seg id="67">He was there only seldom.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place, found him provincial and finely checked and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the university of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You will not become happy here", he said me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began to oscillate between Oxford and the house of my parents and took shelter with more open friends and members of the family in the town.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">He seemed incredulous.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his time in the men in his forties all political views were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it is the best place in the world", he said meekly.</seg>
<seg id="76">They would never do such a thing, not in my town of the dreaming spires.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends always displayed flawless manners.</seg>
<seg id="78">His humid eyes went cloudy.</seg>
<seg id="79">Give to the whole a chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure, one teases you only.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break to me the heart if you went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausted by my frequent trips to London my emotional opposition became weaker.</seg>
<seg id="83">One of my male friends, also Tory follower, had given way to the pressure and had renounced his convictions.</seg>
<seg id="84">During a seminar the next week with which another historical tutor had seriously stated I am "an enemy of the people", I resolved to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Although I melted in petto before shame, I admitted that me my parents of a "brainwashing" had submitted, and called them "old idiots".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The relief continued only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time he wrote per week two columns in the Murdoch press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was closed.</seg>
<seg id="90">I hid in my room, and after five minutes my Häscher surrendered.</seg>
<seg id="91">When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">With pleasure you can call me a tearful wimp.</seg>
<seg id="94">But no 18-year-old should one day have to suffer in an educational institution from such intimidation and wickedness.</seg>
<seg id="95">And it is even more tragic that it Oxford was hidden - a university which produced not only 14 Tory prime ministers but itself till this day behind an undeserved call by equal rights and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Valentino prefers elegance of the fame"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of the Couture" which was opened this week in London speaks ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion doer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital which is worthy of the accomodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.</seg>
<seg id="4">The designer has this by the opening of "Valentino - master of the Couture" approved, a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the haute couture were put together which were created by his "Maison" during the last 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I love this palace", he says with his unmistakeable Italian accent.</seg>
<seg id="6">This exhibition is the end of a history whose only protagonist "il signore" Garavani is which could not have been written, however, without his distinguished clientele.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Valentino always felt fascination for the musty and distant world of the nobility.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the first hall of this exhibition which shall still be seen up to the 3rd of March there is a huge number of private letters and photos with the signature of the most select aristocracy, starting from which princess Salimah Aga Khan, about the princess Marie-Chantal von Griechenland and Margarita von England up to lord Snowdon.</seg>
<seg id="9">Valentino shows these personal recollections as trophies of his social rise of the modest fashion doer in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To be in love in the nobility, must not be from disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="11">"At least they do not stamp out her springs on your marvellous carpet as it some nice fames from the pop music act", says baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the 60s and 70s the both lived in the Alps and were good friends.</seg>
<seg id="13">Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We everybody were glad if we were invited in his house in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely makes friends with forgotten beauties as for example Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.</seg>
<seg id="15">Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the fame.</seg>
<seg id="16">And still he is a star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion doer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many years ago we went after a fashion show in the Piazza Tu Spagna in Rome to him home to the dinner.</seg>
<seg id="20">We were approximate 20 people, under it also Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.</seg>
<seg id="21">One recognised and felt his influence by every detail of his flat, the decoration, in food and in the music.</seg>
<seg id="22">"All invited felt important and beloved", remembers the "top model" which began her career with the week of the haute couture in 1995 in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="23">"He never falls out of fashion because his designs pieces of art are" she says finally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Fashion show of the origin</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The life of Garavani is no history of craze, rather from mutual love affairs.</seg>
<seg id="26">He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.</seg>
<seg id="27">One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long catwalk which suggests a role exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" which carries masterpieces of Valentino, as for example the dress which Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes which Monica Vitti carried in "La Notte", or a coat from wool and leather which belonged to the empress Farah Diba.</seg>
<seg id="28">In this audience from model types names shine like that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario von Bulgarien or Sofía von Habsburg.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Naty Abascal and the fashion doer, in 2006</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Many of these customers say who is the first Valentino like the first love, "unforgettably".</seg>
<seg id="31">I can still remember perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="32">These were trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1971-1972.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was a present of him", says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I prefer him to all others because of his great love for the women and because he emphasises our beauty,", the ex-duchess of Feria adds.</seg>
<seg id="35">I like the colours, which he used, very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.</seg>
<seg id="36">The proportions are perfect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Also the princess and opinion-leading with the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola mountain D'aren cannot forget the first time when she carried Valentino.</seg>
<seg id="38">When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamt of having, finally, the age and the opportunity of carrying one of his evening dresses...</seg>
<seg id="39">Then in the end of the 90s it arrived, finally.</seg>
<seg id="40">I bought to myself my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, which prince Edouard de Ligne.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped upper top with a low neckline which does credit to his name.</seg>
<seg id="42">"It was a true become dream", says the widow of Rodrigo mountain D'aren.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="44">The princess mountain D'aren keeps her evening dresses of the fashion doer "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the recollections linked with it".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The "king" of the fashion</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The big finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="47">Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (how the fashion doer his seamstresses called) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a 4,5-metre-long tail.</seg>
<seg id="48">According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the uppermost authority of the specialist publications, this dress was a landmark in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the uppermost society".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Now clouded for years with "savoir-être" of the élite, Valentino is her best copy.</seg>
<seg id="50">Garavani so a lot of honour, how each of the husbands of his customers accumulates Cavaliere Tu grain Croce (the highest honouring of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre of the Arts et of the Lettres, excellent with the Legion of Honor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"To me is always his cunning, his rest have struck cultivated and perfect appearance", admits mountain D'aren.</seg>
<seg id="52">I have seen him the last time one month ago with a gala dinner in the museum de Orsay.</seg>
<seg id="53">He sat at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.</seg>
<seg id="54">"He was flawless; the time leaves no tracks in him".</seg>
<seg id="55">And a princess says this...</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The most difficult occupation of the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For four euros the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk her life and her health if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur above the precipitous, stony ways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are people for whom her work is the hell, and others work word for word in the hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 mine workers who earn her life, while they get sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Java.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition he must rise every day down on the ground of his crater where the sulphur-containing gas streaming out from the earth hardens in the contact with the air.</seg>
<seg id="6">After he has quarried out big sulphur stones which can weigh all together up to 70 kilos, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders about the sloping paths of stone.</seg>
<seg id="7">Though there are only 250 metres up to the point of the volcano which rises till a height of 2386 metres, but the tired bearers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the tortoise's tempo and they keep the balance and must put her steps carefully, so that they do not slip and fall.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that every step can cost her life as this one French tourist happened who fell years ago in the Steilhängen of the Kawah Ijen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 eurocents for every kilo of sulphur which they diminish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On top come, they make a way the way between the tourists of whom they take a photo like circus monkey and three kilometres run with the exhaustingly heavy baskets up to the scales which have put up a mine society a little wide below on a height of 1850 metres</seg>
<seg id="11">The society is a PT Candi Ngrimbi which uses since 1960 the occurence in the volcano and (never better said) his workers to whom she pays 662 Indonesian Rupien (5 eurocents) for every kilo of sulphur.</seg>
<seg id="12">This sells them then for 10,000 Rupien (83 eurocents) to the petrochemische industry because this mineral is widespread in the everyday life and is used to the production by matches, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the pale of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"Because we ordinarily carry 70 kg, we receive for every way about 46,000 Rupien (3.8 euros) ", explains to us Anto which makes normally three distances on the day.</seg>
<seg id="14">For every distance he needs three hours after which he is made complete, then, however, at the end of the day he has 138,000 Rupien (11.5 euros) together.</seg>
<seg id="15">What looks like a miserable wage for such an almost inhuman strain, however, are the three times as much of that what he would earn with the work in the fields.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The daily wage of the mine workers here where with the coffee harvest 15,000 Rupien (1.2 euros) are paid on the day and the average monthly income to two millions Rupien (167 euros) amounts, is very high", explains the bearer who worked before as a bricklayer on the tourist island Bali.</seg>
<seg id="17">There he earned 75,000 Rupien (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for reason which is in Indonesia as importantly as the sulphur: "I have married a girl for Bali where they are Hinduisten, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The 27-year-old Anto risks for three years his life in the Kawah Ijen whose sulphur has already left the first tracks with to him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price which he must pay for the achievement of his dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I will work here another two years because I would like to open a store or learn Spanish or French", he promises into more than only suitable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">These likeable and intelligent, but from the life punished young man could work as a tour guide, waiter or in the receipt of a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a Tragesels.</seg>
<seg id="24">He divides a dirty wooden hut with other bearers and gets up every morning at two o'clock because the sulphur also streams out at night where his typical yellow colour shines in the darkness bluish.</seg>
<seg id="25">The shades challenging, he rises in the light of a small forehead lamp in his helmet which he has bought to himself from his own money, in the crater.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">About 400 bearers burden themselves the baskets with sulphur on her shoulders on the crater ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In spite of her big profits the mine society has not mechanised the sulphur dismantling to save costs, and delivers to the bearers who work at own account and are paid after weight, no equipment.</seg>
<seg id="28">They also receive no portion in 30,000 Rupien (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera which the guards of this nature reserve require together with the entrance fee at the rate of 15,000 Rupien (1.2 euros) of the tourists who come for taking a photo of of the volcano and the human Tragesel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"This work is for the animals and not for the person" protests Madrusin, a stocky, 42 year-old bearer who works three decades since abandonment of the school on the Kawah Ijen.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as it goes" because he needs the money for the education of his three children at the age between 10 and 18 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not go to pension, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes itch if the wind suddenly turns and gets caught the mine workers in the thick columns which climb up from the crater, the men are so hard that nobody about heavy illnesses complains... of course except the usual breath problems, arthrosis, pains in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders which have gone out of shape from the weight of the baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With the basket on his back Unainik with his 53 years is able only to carry 50 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Every day he and his companions break 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano which are transported by three LKWs about a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres of distance.</seg>
<seg id="35">"I will not go to pension, I will die here because the volcano my whole life was" explained Unainik and he opens his mouth far in which some teeth are absent.</seg>
<seg id="36">From his five children the oldest with his 30 years also works as a sulphur bearer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The time passes, but the arm bliss stops generation on generation in one of the hardest occupations of the world: that which work as human load donkeys on the Kawah Ijen.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Singapore needs babies to the rescue of the economy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Singaporeans pin the blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the costs of the real estate and the child education.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The population of Singapore must grow."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: If we fulfil our civic duty and we create life!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It seems unplausible that the verses are a part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but still - or just so - they became at the beginning of this year in Singapore a viral video on YouTube.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The sentences are a part of a rapper's song, the local sayings as for example "Will push a "bao" (loaf) in the stove to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The advertising company BBH which has turned the video protects hope that the commercial in amusing way reaches to draw the attention to the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Their creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of the music to bring the people to it, her "national duty" fulfil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This is something only for Internet, therefore, we had to form it funnily and wittily.</seg>
<seg id="10">It concerns the biggest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">While reproducing we are the worst of the world, therefore, we noticed that it concerns a subject after which we had to look.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried a lot, as for example the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organisation of speed Dating evenings (quick flirtations).</seg>
<seg id="13">Possibly that many of these ideas were creative, however, they did not lead to success compelling.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hence, we thought: Why do we not make a little bit so creatively as possible to approach this problem, as for example to compose a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Who takes this subject not easily, is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every year she spends 1,300 US dollars on political measures to stimulate the citizens, to get more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A package of the government for married couples and parents grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends the maternity vacation and distributes tax advantages.</seg>
<seg id="19">But everything achieved up to now little success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich, highly technological town state in the southeast of Asia which is also known for the conservatism of his governing and his strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Presently according to his national population authority the birth rate lies with 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time when this rate amounted to more than 2 - what also as a compensation rate is known - was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why do the Singaporeans not get any more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Ming, manager for marriage politics and family politics of the national population authority, says that this is due to a "better education" and "bigger career chances".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This has enabled to the people to marry except and to form a family substantially to have more options concerning life aims and to set priorities", she explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in the social circumstances have contributed to the higher number to single and in putting off the marriage and births whose result is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile led an immigration policy which is aimed at a drastic increase of the immigrations to counteract against the reduction of the population, to resentments with the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore there are web pages where the hardly concealed xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese who are criticised for the fact that they hold the wages low and do not integrate themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The increase of the immigration is also looked as one of the reasons about the fact that the government party achieved her worst election result since the independence in Singapore the last year.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since elections an attempt was started correcting the problem with higher contributions and deliveries for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the falling birth rate has the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the inland revenue, the health costs and the immigration policy, the example shows Singapore also unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government tries to reach that so many small flats are not built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Thus she already also has effects on the flat market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authority for urban development has begun to control the number in small flats which are known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the town.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These flats have a living space of 46 square metres and show a big sales success.</seg>
<seg id="37">Indeed, the worry insists that they can promote the life style of the single, and that they deter the construction companies to build big flat for families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company Tablespoon Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" much faster than bigger residential units are for sale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are so popular, and the units are faster sold off on days and even weeks than the bigger residential units.</seg>
<seg id="40">This leads to the fact that they are much better for our Cash Flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, he admits that the new norms give to the developers clearer orientations to which before obstacles were laid in the way if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stress</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a town state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase of the national birth rate, is to the talks with the Singaporeans who work in the finance quarter on inferring that they will have no big effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"The people are strongly put under stress, the flats and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many" says a young manager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The children can get others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"For me it is important to dispose of my own money and time" says another, about twenty year-old man.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women state her career, the stress and the costs for the property and the education as reasons for the fact that they can have no children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Therefore, the Singaporeans have the last word if it is a matter of getting children - there the government can still act so much.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Privacy</seg>
<seg id="3">Besides, according to the dictionary it concerns the quality privately or "that area of the private life where one is entitled to protection before every kind of interference".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">What is private for somebody less than 16 years?</seg>
<seg id="5">How is this definition applied to his everyday life and the social networks?</seg>
<seg id="6">Does he understand the dangers to which he exposes himself if he announces on the Internet situations which he would not divide in the real life?</seg>
<seg id="7">El Periódico interviewed five youngsters at the age between 10 and 15 years who are on the move often in the net.</seg>
<seg id="8">In four of the cases they tied together the concept with "a little bit very own" at personal level and "on the password and the user" if they applied him to the social networks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My deepest secrets I would not be known in a post give" 10 year-old Jorge says with the attempt to explain the meaning from "privately" in web pages like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows to live messenger where he disposes for two years of accounts.</seg>
<seg id="10">"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but the whole world", he does not confirm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">On FB I load nice pictures or pictures of plays high.</seg>
<seg id="12">I also kill to me my time with friends.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I would divide no photo which is not from me, or from somebody, that the fool makes" he says.</seg>
<seg id="14">The boy is about that in the clear that it is wrong, indecent photos, from naked to publish from crime, or to write insulting or forcible comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Jorge assures to know 35 friends whom he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most are relatives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Under it also the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.</seg>
<seg id="18">I announced myself with Twitter to express myself and to write interesting Tweets.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I do not know whether somebody answers to me, I load them only high" he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak fast with relatives in the distance or with friends" he brags.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asked he answers that he never accepted an invitation of a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even if somebody would recommend him a stranger, he would ignore this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The case of 14-year-old José differently lies.</seg>
<seg id="24">The teenager has accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, micron Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not knowing 20 of the people whom he has added to his friend's list.</seg>
<seg id="25">"This does not frighten me because we have a little bit commonly, for example, music", he brags.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">According to the boy nobody has made to him indications or has asked him for his address or phone number.</seg>
<seg id="27">"If somebody presses me or requires them of me, I remove him simply from my account" he admits.</seg>
<seg id="28">José contacted Ask, after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The experiences which one knows today as a Cyberbullying are not unknown to the boy.</seg>
<seg id="30">The friend of a friend was blackmailed on a social network.</seg>
<seg id="31">They threatened him and required money.</seg>
<seg id="32">"He has never got to know who was it", he assures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">According to José the victim has not closed the account.</seg>
<seg id="34">"He has made it only private."</seg>
<seg id="35">Then he explains a row of steps to configure an account certainly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As opposed to Jorge this young photo of friends in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations would become a high-level store.</seg>
<seg id="37">Yes, this I would act if he is unpleasant to me or I want to wipe out one to him.</seg>
<seg id="38">"But I know that this Cyberbullying is" he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Key questions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Marielos Porras, teacher for English with Master's certificate in education and learning, believes, that to orient around the children and youngsters, must be understood that it is a purpose of the social networks to inform.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The Internet originated as a medium for the search according to the information of; however, with the appearance of these sides the rules of the game have changed", she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras explains that the graduate Marc Prensky, owner of a master title formed these concepts to the explanation of the phenomenon in educational theory at the university of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants".</seg>
<seg id="43">The digital Natives are they, the children and youngsters who have grown up with this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are the digital immigrants whom they should teach where we, nevertheless, learn ourselves still" he says.</seg>

<seg id="45">He explains that it concerns a complicated subject, "because we require from them that they a defined criterion about have published what spreads or may be said, and this at an age where the maturity is for it not enough."</seg>
<seg id="46">"You should be also fastidious if it is the most important to them, to be liked, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the results", he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the expert the most effective way, to the children and youngsters is to be taught what is a privacy to put to them questions which she brings to the reflexion.</seg>
<seg id="48">"To say you, they should not do it, does not function", he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Afterwards Porras calls some possibilities: There are things which you would not tell a stranger. Why do you make it then on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or: Would you like it if one publishes a photo of you, how this that you have published from a friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">Do you know what the others about you publish?</seg>
<seg id="52">Have you asked the other people before around permission if you have labelled photos of celebrations?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more question: Must everybody know what you do at every moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to give to understand to them that they must trade on-line how they do it off-line.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Somebody beyond the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must be valid for the social networks", he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Supervision</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Estuardo Guardia, university professor, basic schoolteacher and pedagogic adviser, comments, that it inalienably that the parents peruse the directives of the social networks carefully.</seg>
<seg id="59">If they all understand segments, they dispose of respectable bases to talk with her children about the meaning of the Eröffnens one accounts on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="60">"For example, the age, or what one may share or publish" he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">According to Guardia the children must be reminded of the lesson "you should not speak with strangers".</seg>

<seg id="1">End of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the explanation of Lima</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Today the 6th summit of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) ended in Peru without publication of the explanation of Lima which was announced before and should be signed theoretically by seven present governing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Efe tried repeatedly, access to the signed document with VI. To attain well-arranged meeting of the state heads and government heads of the Unasur. In the beginning springs in the state office and presidential office informed that they handed over it after the exam, explained afterwards, nevertheless, that it was published at certain time on the web page of the Peruvian government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">With questions to the text they gave that the contents were demonstrated by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, with short explanations to the press.</seg>
<seg id="5">The access of the journalists to the information about the summit was limited at every time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">During the day only the picture of the presidential meeting became in the press space without tone with the announcement "private meeting, limited audio" transfer.</seg>
<seg id="7">Few information which circulated among the journalists was received from the press agents of some of the governments present at the meeting of the Unasur, but not from the Peruvian press agent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The only document which was spread during the day was the list of the participant presidents what caused in the hundreds of journalists of different national and international media Uneasiness which demanded more information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Then the presidential office of Peru sent e-mail with the "final explanation" of the summit to the media and it concerned, however, the explanation of Humala and not around the official document for the end of the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In the last October Peru was a host of the III summit South America - Arabian states (ASPA), and also with this opportunity the so-called explanation of Lima which one had announced before was just as little published in spite of emphatic request by the press.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the official web page of the ASPA one can convince himself of the fact that the document was published on the last Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">On both international meetings the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems existed for the journalists, however, they limited the access to the information in a high degree.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The summit also ended with the common obligation of Chile and Peru to suppose a judgment of the court of law of Hague which adds a border conflict between both countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they accepted the decision of the IGH which begins on Monday in Hague, in the process which Lima initiated against Santiago to listen to the pleadings of both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">"We will obey the judgment about the differences which we bring forward presently to this international court of law and explain", said Humala together with his Chilean opponent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Chile was, is and also remains furthermore a country which keeps to the international laws, peaceful solutions for disputes searches, agreement closes and submits to the international courts of law", adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the IGH occurred, after Colombia had lodged complaint against the agreement of Bogotá after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua which it held for a heavy mistake in what it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court of law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">With the summit present were the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, from Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, from Bolivia, Evo Morales, and from Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.</seg>
<seg id="19">Paraguay which is excluded since 2011 after the dismissal of his president Fernando Lugo from the Unasur did not take part in the meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The host president Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and finished the summit shortly after the midday in Lima.</seg>
<seg id="21">The head of state read out the final document in what it informed that 16 decisions were met and the action lines were fixed for 31 projects between the South American countries about an investment amount of a total of 17 milliard dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">To the grieved decisions he said that the countries of the Unasur "take important steps in the direction of the aim of a South American citizenship what we expand the decisions about stay rights into."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He informed that measures were sped up to improve the cooperation in the fight against the insecurity in the towns and against the organised, land-covering crime ", as well as measures to improve the access to drugs and to the Internet for low prices in all areas of South America and to act in the case of natural disasters together and efficiently".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">With the crisis in Europe "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) may accept no triumphing trains, but should serve to expand our output capacity and to indicate a better future our people", Humala added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We have decided to give the priority to a row of 31 emblematic projects which should improve the spatial connections in South America and particularly in rural and border areas... and therefore our countries unite and open new economic systems", said the Peruvian president in a read out explanation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Under these projects would also be five Peruvian ones which would lie on the transverse axes of his area of the coast to Brazil, from what two should provide for a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Also the final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We hope that the electoral process serves in this country for his resumption in the union of South American nations" from which it is excluded presently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The need that Latin America also remains furthermore an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good nachbarschaftlichen relations was another aspect which was stressed on the summit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In this sense the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before the beginning of his participation in the regional meeting said that he expected a meeting with his opponent from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico, to treat the maritime conflict after a judgment questioned by Bogotá of the IGH deferentially.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"Possibly I will meet on the tomorrow's day (Saturday) president Daniel Ortega", said Santos.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We will check all these ways - they are not excluding, and also talks with Nicaragua make the agreement with Nicaragua necessary", he underlined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"I hope to the president Ortega to be able to say that we this matter civilises so and deferentially as possible will treat", Santos added.</seg>
<seg id="34">Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they have the intention to be present by the office takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">As a part of the summit the defence ministers of the block also met in the approach for the discharge of the measure plan for 2013 in what the dialogue and consensus should be strengthened concerning the defence of the region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members with the UNASUR, even if the latter country is excluded currently.</seg>
<seg id="37">Peru presides on time of the regional block.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"South America must learn by the integration of the citizens", says Rafael Correa</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Today the president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an aim and "South America can really learn somewhat of Europe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa which took part in the 6th summit of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) which took place in Lima explained to the state television in Peru that the Europeans killed themselves "during the second world war and in other discussions" and "today practically a native country are."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense he defended the project to create a South American citizenship which the member's states of the Unasur speed up.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The free circulation of the citizens and workers must be reached in all South American countries as this is the case already in the Andes community; however, there are still reactionary sectors which aim at a return in the past", warned he.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Moreover, the president of Ecuador recommended the reorganisation of the organisation of American states (OEA) under the default to reduce the influence of the anglo-saxon states and to consider that which have signed the agreement of San José about human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Which teach never commit themselves to something, and as a countermove in addition we sign the South Americans always everything.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible that the interamerican commission has her seat in Washington for human rights and is financed from the United States", he explained as an allusion on the political asylum which has granted Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa assured that he does not regret this decision because he has betrayed with it not his principles, but to his "deep democratic values and views about human rights" has followed.</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that there has been at that time "reasonable supposition that Assange would be delivered to a third country and his procedure would not be kept."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Moreover, he criticised the Swedish justice which has required from him to submit him on his state area to a questioning because of a supposed sexual offence, while the "Swedish administration of justice permits this by means of a video conference which could have been explained about the message of Ecuador in London."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa explained that the danger insisted that the health and the psychic state would be affected by Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken with him, however, the ambassadress has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but nobody serious", said the head of state of Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">However, there is the danger that he would take physical and psychic damage because he would be caught in a narrow space and can carry out no physical exercises outside.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This would affect the health of every person", he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa gave that the solution was granted for the asylum, the Assange since the June in the message of Ecuador in London which is a granting of a charter with which he can travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juridical authorities of Europa's. He underlined that there have been talks with London to find a solution for the locked up founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not act with the human rights, we do not apply this word for this case, however, there have been constant talks.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution for this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juridical authorities of Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a row of procedure on different European authorities leads", he explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And "if Great Britain morning grants this charter, this is finished in my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden Mr. Assange on the message of Ecuador interrogated in London or about Skype as it admits the Swedish administration of justice and was made in other cases, the problem would be finished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa used the opportunity to be confirmed as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity, the bad intention and the lie are which weaken the freedom of speech."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the bad and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail", he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this sense he congratulated himself that Ecuador is not controlled any more by such journalists "and also not from the bankers or hegemonischen and middle-class countries", and anticipated that he will deepen with a reelection "the revolution to continue the way in this right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to his next elections and he argued that the organism "must remain hard and may grant no opportunism and nobody as a legally dressed up coup d'état" because thereby "the legitimacy of the democracy was destroyed in Paraguay."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Moreover, the president of Ecuador holds the wish of his Colombian opponent to negotiate Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the international court of law of Hague, which the maritime state Highness of Nicaragua bevorteilte, with Nicaragua the sea-juridical borders between both countries, for "absolute entitles."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Presently this judgment is not moved.</seg>
<seg id="27">It concerns a problem between the south and a Medium American state.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, however, they must be overcome in the striving for a common way.</seg>
<seg id="29">They must be treated extensively, so that one can overcome them and look forwards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Also he trusted in a good end of the disputes about the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court of law and believed that "it is right for Latin America to call international authorities if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it precipitates very hard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Concerning the possibility that he positions himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to reach in succession his third mandate he gave that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes difficult also very much."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February, 2013 he withdrew from the political life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Power has never interested me personally, but under so unfair circumstances like in Ecuador this socioeconomic poverty can be corrected only by the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement had the faith that I was it which guaranteed this likely victory, therefore, I must follow to this responsibility", he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If I should win, it would be my last period as a president, then I withdraw from the public life.</seg>
<seg id="36">This is also valid if we lose.</seg>
<seg id="37">"This is decided", he explained.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I have spoken just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He has said me that he has travelled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he can travel after the electoral campaign again to Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It means a relapse in the state of health of the president Chávez in no case", he commented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Today the ecuadorianische head of state took part in Lima in the 6th summit of the heads of state and head of government of the union of South American nations (Unasur) which was finished with the call for a higher regional integration to provide for a lasting progress, equality and security.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Today cause for a death because of AIDS is a too late recognition</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when one confirmed the investigation result to him: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was, as if a bomb hit", he says about the moment at which he received the diagnosis which the doctor tried to weaken without recognizable success "".</seg>
<seg id="4">He hid it from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to look only after his illness and began to find out about it; and this with such application that he celebrated just his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unity of the hospital of Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) in which he came after several fights in 1994.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio lives with the human Immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years what was hardly conceivable at the beginning of the 90s when there were many doubts, few possibilities of treatment and more stigmas.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time it itself avoided the manager of a clinic of the IMSS saying goodbye, "because it led in a dead end."</seg>
<seg id="9">At that time AIDS was a synonym for death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Indeed, still many people come to the clinic which know nothing about her illness and with those the virus already damage has arranged and has exhausted her immune system, and which are a victim of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Today 31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, i.e. after appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success means that the survival of a patient who takes up the treatment on time and the survival of the general population are precisely same", explained the leader of the HIV unity of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he said that this information has been supported in April of this year by a respectable scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The expert for infection illnesses and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded since 2008 that AIDS is though no death sentence that, however, would take down the years of the survival and the quality of life on the degree of the interference of the immune system of the people with beginning of the treatment, and that those bigger chances would have which are not addicted to drugs: up to 30 years with a counting of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a counting of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply said, the above implementation means that who receives the diagnosis at the age of 25 years HIV-positive in this sense "can become 75 years old trouble-free, as long as he stands under control", explained this expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To be able to arrange properly this progress, must be reminded of the fact that the life expectancy of the Mexicans amounts today on an average 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Even if the mortality has considerably decreased during the past years (in Mexico has itself the number of the people who die of AIDS, from 6.678 cases in 2007 on 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), it is still right that since the appearance of the AIDS 60 percent of the patients grasped in the national data bank have died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the May of this year these are already 187 deaths; indeed, it is assured that there is universal access to the anti-retro-viral medicaments since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- Why still do people die of it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- In my opinion the problem is not the access to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is my opinion, and thus is in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least during the past 12 years we had no care problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people come in far advanced state because they do not know her infection state, i.e. in very late phases of the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He makes an apt declaration: "Nine of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. To be able to influence the global mortality, untimelier diagnoses are necessary, which is why recognition tests must be offered to all people with whom this is necessary massively."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee for the AIDS avoidance agree to this proposal in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio who allowed to carry out his test with a private lab, and this had for only reason because it a friend of him had made who was in spite of his young age already in the AIDS phase and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a crustaceous tumour) what is one of the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything is different if you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they die, and would like to hear nothing.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I must already die, rather three spots burst", one says in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was for the there improvement, I well live, go in for sports and take the drugs.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today his parents know only that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also live a normal life, how everybody other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, undertake a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and of the other person", Fabrizio enumerates who agreed to divide his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate that with his report which are afraid today within the scope of the worldwide AIDS day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how one can live like all people responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="32">His news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Between the health programmes and the easy citizen big holes exist, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara who has taken care of the thing of the HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the most important is the prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the places certain for it "the distribution was really raised by condoms; earlier they were delivered individually, now they give us packages to with hundred pieces what is quite good, however, there are still people who have no access to a condom", he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">The youngsters count to the risk people for new infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">For what do you need them?" a widespread mockery question of social workers, orientation staff is in schools, employees in chemist's shops and in the health system to which youngsters would not like to expose themselves, assured the correspondent.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested orienting this ineffective distribution anew; the condoms should be not only behind the counter, but be visited in issue devices in public toilets by facilities, often from youngsters.</seg>
<seg id="40">It should not be promoted the promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">It should not be paid to them the beer and motel as the governor Emilio González answered the question whether under his management preservatives were distributed.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Sexuality does not look thus; It is best to give an understanding of the condoms those which already perform a sexual activity", he summed up it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key data of Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIVs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The state lies nationwide seen at the 4th place of new and accumulated AIDS cases, and at the 13th place concerning HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of the infection cases occur about sexual intercourse, 6% about the blood and 2% perinatal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It is estimated that 50,000 people with HIV live because there are for every registered case 4 or 5 people who do not know it.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">After the court of appeal of the United States has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the obligations of the group Vitro which was reached about a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedence is created for every national enterprise with establishments in the neighbouring country which has payment problems.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">One could say that the procedures have no validity to the survival of the enterprises who admit the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and Stripes in the contradiction to international agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In practice the recognition gone out on the 15th of June of the judgment by the judge Harlin Hale in the court leads in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas to the fact that the Mexican enterprises of the seizure of her property are put out beyond the river Bravo! helplessly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Indeed, the decision opens door and gate to the biggest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the uppermost court of law of the United States because of three inconsistencies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">While the judge of the thing points out to the fact that the believers must be defeated by the bankruptcy right of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit with headquarter in New Orleans says first that it concerns with the main procedure the commercial bankruptcy treated in Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would mean that the international cooperation is not known in procedure with insolvency by enterprise with land-covering profile.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Really the model law of the United Nations was created for this purpose for the standardization of the international commercial right and the American Law institutes was used as a mediator.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly the judgment determines that without voices of the societies after recognition of the obligations in the bankrupt's estate which the branches of Vitro with her parent company had not the necessary majority would have been obtained for the restructuring of the obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Indeed, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.</seg>
<seg id="10">Really Vitro is not the first case with which this pattern was admitted.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is half-dozen examples, under it Agremex and Comercial Mexicana whose obligations were confirmed under enterprise of the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (federal institute of commercial bankruptcies).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Moreover, it is right that after deduction of the voices of the branches the believers from Vitro, the believers who complained at the courts of the United States against Vitro would have reached i.e. the vulture grounds as for example Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, no majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would have gone out 45 percent against 37 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This is not considered by the court of appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, there is Vitro guilt for his difficult situation from 2008 within the scope of the big economic crisis in the United States which gave blows to the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">That's why the family González Sada before the same court of appeal inserts contradiction, so that the vote occurs in the plenary sitting, i.e. from all judges because only three voted of it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The world stroller of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was longer to the wicker sport than 60 years linkedly and has travelled around the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">A few in Puerto Rico dispose of such a big spiritual collection of the history of the basketball of the country like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to the wheel chair, Rexes was during 6 years a part of this sport, it is as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, authorised representatives and leaders in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"All my life I have put on in the basketball many hats, even several at the same time when I was a president of the BSN, general managers of the national team and president of the association in the 90s" remembered Reyes in a visit of Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house are decorated almost everybody with photos and recollections of his long career and testify them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The most emotional recollections are that which remind of his time with the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as a player till 1982 where he celebrated his 15-year-old jubilee as a comanager or manager of the club.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"This was my prime of life which I have enjoyed mostly because I part of eight masteries of the Vaqueros since 1967 am it as a manager, comanager or trainer might be.</seg>
<seg id="12">These were many fulfilling years, including five masteries successively from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye with a mastery in 1981, the year of the debut to Jerome Mincy with BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From then took over "Cuco" Ortiz who was a very good governor", says Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I still know that Bartow which worked here as a trainer and was done at the university of Alabama (Birmingham) said me genes: "I have very much a strong and 2-m-player.</seg>
<seg id="16">Would you want him?"</seg>
<seg id="17">And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players whom Puerto Rico ever had.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow recommended afterwards the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse who can be naturalized and one of our best throwers was.</seg>
<seg id="19">I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastery for Bayamon Gausse provided for an other one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The mastery of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance because he stood in 1988 already at the uppermost place of the association.</seg>
<seg id="21">At this time he preferred to enjoy his enforcements and from Mincy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I still know when we won for the first time in the preolympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then the world championship came in 1990 with which we booked the fourth place what should have been, actually, a bronze if not this Canadian referee had been who allowed to repeat the last play train to us for the second time, said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Was this group of the world championship in 1990 the best national team whom you have ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">She belongs to the best, as well as that which won with the Olympic Games in 2004 against the Dream team.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, my favorite is the team of the panamerikanischen plays in 1991 in Cuba where we won gold and offered to the team of the USA a fight, like at that time when they won bronze against us with the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">With that team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, besides, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales who could not be present in 1990 because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team whom maybe concerning personalities the best was not with whom we won, however, a gold medal and which gave big pleasure to us was that of the preolympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute with the closed players because of the incidents on the Panamerikanischen to plays in Mar del Plata, we won against every forecast the gold medal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His figures at level of the international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody in Puerto Rico has as dominated at this level as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he has played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a row of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">From the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What believes you is the best what you have reached in the association?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">I was a part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 who enclosed the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What remains to you still to act?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things which I would have introduced, as for example the regionalisation of the lower categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">The fact that the boys play in Ponce, e.g., only in her area and hit only in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today the children go on needlessly many trips and plays.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the result of the prescribed Ausbildungen and courses for trainers, table official and referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">I am proud of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What do you make today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I hear with pleasure music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and again I go to a basketball play.</seg>
<seg id="49">And of course I enjoy the society of my Mrs. Isabel who was always on my side.</seg>

<seg id="1">Begin of the course which studies the "middle of nowhere"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every week the students examine apocalyptic subjects as for example the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">He knew every semestre if the religious professor decided to hold a course about the middle of nowhere about that he disposed of an irresistible fishhook: the end of the "long reverse counting" of the Maya's calendar on the 21st of December from which many people thought that it means the middle of nowhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">But Charmé had no notion what should expect him during the following both months: the destructive hurricane Sandy which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict with participation of Israel, to the place from which the Christian theorists think that the apocalypse begins.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semestre which there one day was" Charmé this week said the student at the university of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If somebody analyses what has happened today in the world, as if we were removed thirty days from it, would be this one really good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And he reminds of the fact that the bad is well for that with apocalyptic mentality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And he is not the only professor who offers this semestre which should be, actually, last in the history courses about the "middle of nowhere".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In Temple the attending professor Barry Vacker gives the course "to media, culture and the middle of nowhere."</seg>
<seg id="10">Every week the students examine apocalyptic subjects as for example the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyse, which is why these ideas spread out with the time", he said, as well as the way, as hypothetical scenarios are offered which lead to a certain human behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear material reaches in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This month the students analysed films with apocalyptic contents and examined how they can be compared in comparison to the real life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I have tried to inform the students about what is likely possibly, plausible and impossible", said Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the main campus of the university of Pennsylvania have formed the professor for Latin-American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an attending professor for art history and anthropology a team to offer a course with the simple name "The middle of nowhere".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We do not take up in 2012, so that we always keep the option to be able to hold anew the course, for the case that the world does not set" said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In spite of the "forthcoming setting" the students must study, provide projects and take part in final examinations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In kipping State the final examination in the eve of the apocalypse is carried out, which is why the students have no other chance to go on working as "till the night where the world comes to an end supposedly", said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The courses were liked very much.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"In two hours there were no more places" Restall said about his course for students by the high average which filled with 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">For weeks before the semestre beginning we received e-mails from students who asked whether still places are free.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students for their part assure that the course counts to the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"It is to be seen amusing what the people do to console themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.</seg>
<seg id="24">The apocalyptic sect mentality or religious mentality is real only one question of consolation or his absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The 25-year-old student wanting Wekesa for psychology and nursing explained to have seen all apocalyptic films.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"I have never heard somewhat of lessons where this is informed", he bragged.</seg>
<seg id="27">I enjoy it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the questioned students - and less one more professor - declared to believe in the last date of the 21st of December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project treated the prophecy of Maya, and in certain way we discredit them", said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from west Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Maya never forecast the middle of nowhere; it concerns only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">However, he marks that in the western society apocalyptic fear exists which goes back several centuries, as the people reacted to changes in her surroundings with the prediction of the middle of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet has raised these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Elsewhere the people do not think in such a way", he says.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is principal in the English-speaking world the case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor of the university of La Salle who informs this year on the Philippines answers fast the question whether he knew there a course about the "middle of nowhere".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines do not take part at the back of beyond", he wrote as an indication of an exception of a higher authority.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon of the pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall pointed out to the fact that many days of the last court were spoken of the years, and said that if on the 21st of December nothing happens, "the people immediately of a new date think" or about the fact philosophised that the 21st of December is the beginning of a seven-year-old period after which the middle of nowhere would come.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Students and professors take this date easily.</seg>
<seg id="40">Several said that they liked to go to celebrations about the "middle of nowhere".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">"Maybe I call a few friends, so that we can laugh together", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.</seg>
