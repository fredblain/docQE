A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
However, the latter is the Brennan Center is a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The attorneys for the Republicans have seen in 10 years in the U.S. only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the democratic system the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
In contrast to Canada, the United states for the conduct of the elections in the various states.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, has announced new laws that the process for registering or the ballot.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections on November 2010, which resulted in 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The new election laws require that voters present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Moreover, these laws also will be shortened the time periods for the early vote, declared the law invalid, to register as voters on election day and citizens the right to vote, for which there is a legal acts.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Before the elections of 2006, no U.S. state has asked the voters to show photo identification.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The United States Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The Republican authorities rushed to extend it to other states.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Over the last two years, in 34 states draft laws, which forced the voters to show photo identification.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
It is important to note that the U.S. citizens do not unlike Quebec on an universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million vocal people no photo identification issued by a governmental authority of their state.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary documents.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
The new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years on the required photo ID.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
This goes further.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The students who are seen as voters casting their votes for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo ID issued by the establishment.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
On the other hand, allow the same States members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Before 2004, no state has called for proof of citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Arizona was the first state, who introduced such a request.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Since 2011 a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Clearly these measures are designed to limit the Hispanic votes.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states have laws, doing away with the registration of voters on election day.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
You have also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
These restrictions are not without consequences.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
For example, the campaigns have contributed to voter registration in the 2004 general election to register some 10 million citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Because the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006% by 17.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
The Republican legislators in five other states have also adopted laws that aim to shorten the period for early voting.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida was 33% of the voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though they represent only 13% of voters in the state.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The latter was only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
By contrast, the White, which represented 76% of the voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the controversial legislation.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
They could limit the damage.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have laws that require the of a photo ID.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
However, the new rules introduced in 2012, the exercise of the right to vote.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the 2012 key states.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
A report by the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws, which make up 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the democratic system the United States.

Prostate cancer screening: the test should not be made or?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
In fact, the PSA test would sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This leads to a greater reluctance of undecided women for screening tests.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The test should not be made or?
</seg>
<seg id="5">
We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous confounding factors between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret this data and to give clear recommendations.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the likelihood of metastasized by 30% to 40% higher if no screening was.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
That is why I recommend the test at the age of 50 or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In men of American origin, there is also a higher risk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was identified.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There are cancers that aggressive and others who are indolent.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Really understand the magnitude of the risk of cancer the patients must be made by him to the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate crabs, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases to prefer an active monitoring of the disease.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Today, many of the men, which is cancer, no treatment, not because their cancer is aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
With increasing accuracy determined the criteria for a decision that should be dealt with.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
I therefore recommend the implementation of the tests.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA tests.

To prevent the disease
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eating well and will be sufficient.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"If there were no smoking, this value would rise at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers caused by inheritance.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Several remain unresolved.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
It damages the health of the people.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The weight
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
It seems the risk for breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and cervical cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout the entire life," he adds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
The diet
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In great quantity it increases the risk of developing a Grimm or rectal cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Salami should be avoided.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"The latter can harm the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Vitamins
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Currently, but their investigations are not conclusive.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
According to the Canadian Cancer Society are the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
A study has found that reducing the risk of prostate cancer, an increase.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also has not yet clear.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
In addition, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is to talk with his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."

The Higgs boson analysed
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bos' last summer has caused a stir, and for good reason.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It is believed that the boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And it is the last particle whose existence the Standard Model - our best or the least "false" statement of nature and the behavior of matter -, predicted, but not been observed empirically.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
But for the physicist, it is not yet completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs boson.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It seems to be confirmed by new data to be presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data to be completely secure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
We are assuming that it is indeed the Higgs, since there is apparently only a small risk of getting things wrong, and we look at what is at stake.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
In this world there is inevitably a crucial law that that can't be two objects in the same place at the same time.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It is not possible to break this rule - and do not try too hard, because you are hurt.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it is also applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles can occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state," with a law "state" by and large, of some of its properties.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
On this basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In one corner are the good citizens, who are known as Fermi one and obey polite the Pauli principles.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And in the other the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, which is nothing sacred not in any case, the precautionary principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same time, at the same place.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
These bosons divided according to the website the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Greek barys, which we will deal with here and the "power particles," through which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson, would be used.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
It must be stressed, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures, as you might think.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
If you are able to read this story, then only thanks to a Bosons exceptional banality: the photon, or particle of the "light" that the "messenger" is of electromagnetic force.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
If a particle with an electric charge or change the direction of the electromagnetic field on this "disrupted," as a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "sources of power."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
More stable field
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, "disrupted," so that shows the boson.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface could be spall only by a very large rocks.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
That is why a giant particle accelerator as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with an of 27 km! - In order to achieve this kind of energy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It is not in fact all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - for example, would never keep a piece of paper from the fridge.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the other (like the photon) have no mass.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
For all this research, "which can be good," says Mrs Plamondon?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all deviations between the observations and to investigate the predictions of the SM.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
There are also many physicists who sincerely hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference open a door to a "new physics" and could fill a few holes of the model.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It must be said that there are still major shortcomings in the latter, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!), and the dark matter, which is about 80% of matter in the universe (again ups!).
</seg>
<seg id="32">
But at the CERN such deviations were not found until now.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Impact
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
By the way: in the early 60 s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs have that their work would trigger such a revolution.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser in the 1960 s was invented 1962, and even the first laser (the first was NI) has developed - said that the laser at the beginning rather than a "gimmick."
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Imagine...
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
In addition, there are also applications for all the instruments that surround the research.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
For example, in turn, has developed warm Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the pulp a small light sensor.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Although it was not the original purpose of this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has won him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC inevitably will change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...

Problem of access to palliative care

It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is, to a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in a hospital or a nursing home.

<seg id="47">
And several organisations, such as the pet Victor Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.

It is this major shortcomings in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of of a law on euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Since the month of October is a manifesto, signed by prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec the health system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting move to euthanasia.

<p>
<seg id="51">
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, has taken measures to alleviate.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
The, while several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions fought until the last day.

<seg id="54">
The survival of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has broken off a difficult chemotherapy.

As I told my oncologist that I will drop out of the treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told.

<seg id="56">
However, she said to me that I was at the end.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
No omnipotent care
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
But it must be said clearly that is not the Continuum palliative care for pain treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
After a young man Monereau, director of the palliative care of society is not talking of domestic palliative care of Greater Montreal 8% of patients in pain treatment.
</seg>

At the very end of life so doctors often back to the C-terminal sedation, which seeks to lull the patients either permanently or intermittently until the time of his death.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
We can no longer act as if we do not see this side of the suffering.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to use this C-terminal sedation.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Patients, not to alleviate their pain, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
</seg>
<seg id="65">
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want to put me," but "I would like to see reduced my pain."

Real estate major scandals in Quebec
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Officials of the roads, companies in the building industry sector, political parties and fundraisers specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system," in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
An "industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990 s and 2000 s.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"It is strange how the system, since it has taken drastic measures," Sperling jokes Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Montreal in Quebec and a former head of the police.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The scandal was exposed by him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the treaties to road construction in Quebec, who agreed to the then prime minister reluctantly.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
"Since the beginning of the study in 2010," he said, "the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars of the Treaties," because some zügelten its instinct to get their share.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors on a case-by-case basis," he adds, in the hope that it can "to show the tactics behind the individuals."

Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit is with its troops to auditors, investigating and analysts of the government.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
In addition, the police force, "and was," which since 2009 has ensured that the "sewer cartel" Montreal is in the artificial inflation of of the Treaties cautious...
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In recent weeks it has made a series of raids and made allegations of fraud and corruption against local officeholders, such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, the mayor of a suburb.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city, has resigned.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
He is suspected of repeatedly received in exchange for public contracts bribes.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Incidentally, engineers were specifically accused of road construction official from Montreal, and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The latter has attracted attention by the Commission of the operation of the "system" has declared for the preservation of public contracts.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
He himself has paid for several years in Montreal received 3% of the value of the contracts to a broker linked to the Mafia, who gave the money to the Union, the party of mayors Geraldine Tremblay.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Mr Zambito everywhere in the 2000 s has had his hand in the game by more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
He also confessed to organising an illegal fund-raising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normand Jauneau.

Sewerage contracts, the costs of have been artificially inflated
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described in detail the Commission: in ten years ago, he received from the construction company gifts and invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts, whose cost it artificially pumping up.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Other Road Administration officials have admitted that they did, by aufblähten smear the bills with false services artificially by 30-40%.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget, filled its coffers with undeclared money.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
As a result of these revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which left Montreal in a serious crisis.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Chantal Rouleau, was one of the first Members of Montreal, proposed the alarm.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
As mayor of the District Rivière of Prai Ries, in the east of the island, they declined from 2010 against the sale of municipal land that bought for $5 million and was sold for 1.6 million of property developers in the booming real estate market.

</seg>
<seg id="30">
She says that the process "painful, but positive."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
We are about to clean the wound, but need a certain investigative unit, only for Montreal and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
How do you clean.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Regularly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
For its part, Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but especially concerned about the role of "office holders, who are the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Based on a 70% share of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is a poor substitute for reality."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, according to what he would change nothing about the situation: "as long as the election campaign spending will be strictly limited, black money in politics."
</seg>
<seg id="37">
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing of the parties: "we must not go deeper; when we get to the bottom with courage, we can can build a house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."

"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
This season with PSG have adopted a new scale.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
How do you explain this progress?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
You can explain it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Great players have come.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Every day I am on their side.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The technical staff has given me a lot.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
These factors spurring me on a daily basis to improve my game.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And in a game that is even easier.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In football everything is going very quickly.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
But I must stop in enthusiasm.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Since my early days at the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my time in St Etienne I have always made gradual progress.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
</seg>
<seg id="14">
This summer the newcomers are used to host games very high levels.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They also know that every training session.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This means that a player like me, and wants to give his best.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Incidentally, it gives me a lot in terms of my game Carlo.Its Ancelotti.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is supported by other coaches as Claude blemish, who played in the same position as me.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Of course.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Ancelotti breathes all technicians respect.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the Ligue 1, there are currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He had contact with great players.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In January, I had a good conversation with him.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The trust that he has put in me, is also an explanation for my services.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the top.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
But we are in the ambush.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified in this way for the World Cup.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
We will try to get as much as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
From now on, everything is possible.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
First, we want to be the first of our group in Porto, so that we can deal with the return leg of the eighth and final home game.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
The PSG can be a big European club in the short term?
</seg>
<seg id="39">
He already has the budget...
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In order to become a major European club, to win Paris title and make a name for the long term.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
This is not the case today.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The PSG financial resources, so that this project is the concrete forms.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
It would be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
This year, it is really important for us to cream off the title.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In the last season we were close.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to secure the victory.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
We have finished with 79 points.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
You should normally be champion with 79 points...
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I believe that this is the right one.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux fight for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
</seg>
<seg id="55">
In view of what has been done and the players that we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
We fully accept that.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
If we win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and it is still something that cannot be accused, this is a bit frustrating.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
One wonders what people expect.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
We are not the FC Barcelona!
</seg>
<seg id="61">
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
A team builds over time.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
You look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, to qualify for the eighth final, and also has made huge spending.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
With regard to the amounts invested you believed to break with 15 points ahead of the.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
This would mean that would let our opponents and the French Cup.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Lyon and Marseille, who were not in the last season, this new PSG "geboostet."
</seg>
<seg id="68">
This shows that the Ligue 1 exciting.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
I hope that we will be in the month of May by the smiling winner and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
So much the better, that of a "Zlatan dependence."
</seg>
<seg id="72">
This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and scores many goals.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
Wherever he has played, he has had in mind that he is a great player and a world star.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
He also respects the people who surrounded him.

From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must show an exemplary behaviour.

<seg id="90">
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.

The national trainer is strictly, the players and encourages the to victory.

As it was Laurent Blanc.

But I would like to make a comparison.
</seg>
<seg id="94">
Blanc had achieved its goal, he had qualified for the European Championships.

<seg id="16">
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
With the difference that the user can choose for each payment to a different address, ensuring the anonymity.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A number of data relating to this transaction will be signed electronically by a double encryption system.

<seg id="19">
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.

With the help of the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the accounting book of the entire network of public accounts.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The crucial step is to sign this new transaction in this book.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
This is a mathematical task, which will be run on computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line.

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which gives him unlimited power temporarily, more divided than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day his final version.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The head of state had granted just a week ago this House two additional months to complete its work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
For almost two years now Egypt is based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This new initiative has only for even greater division of the country.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
For his opponents of the president in his "autocratic delirium," he continues to "breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
On the side of his supporters are assured that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A very short period of, forcing the brothers to abandon their plans to explain the Egyptians the text section for section.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It is also a way for the president, to his public and democratic legitimacy, while protests raging across the country.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
As you have heard in an interview with the American Wochenschau Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Given that the Egyptian people will be charged with this recourse to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either agrees for my draft or I am the unlimited power," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution to an end.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent assembly approved the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have tended to move, because they believe that they are not able to express their views.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Representatives from human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have been equally.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members, added.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... The time has come for the prayer, because some members were of the opinion that the pendulum clock was not of the constituent assembly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Article 2, drew all the attention, after all, identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped, "the principles" by "the rules," which would have made a stronger application possible.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has been amended, proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"Hypocrisy" of the liberals, who see it as nothing more than propaganda.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The Islamisation of the Constitution via other articles.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
They are especially Article 220, which grants the University of Al Azhar an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of the compliance with the laws of Sharia.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier is worrying, because "the people who are being asked to give its opinion, have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
You can see that the first signs of a theocracy. "
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The fears of the Liberals also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the university of should be much less moderate than the present.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"There is no specific religious commitment.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no Ulema, but academics, who have been trained in the French system, "appeased Alexis Blouet who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But he admits, "that may be in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity, as are the terms used borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
It refers in particular to the "fiqh," Islamic jurisprudence.].
</seg>
<seg id="38">
And in the future could be raised the question of to what extent are competent civilian judges to decide. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
In addition to his criticism of the religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday sharply because of the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they are reduced compared with the former regime.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
In accordance with the wishes of the military will be submitted to the examination of the defence budget to Parliament, but a national defence council.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Just as there will be no ban on civilian trials in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
They also share their concerns with regard to the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Moreover, no article refers more to the protection of women, Palestinian Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
They believe that the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The word was not included in the previous constitution.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
While the Egyptian President had to say on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.

Human rights activists, however, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press the following question: What does it?
</seg>
<seg id="18">
What changes does the legislation required to have language skills, both for the Russians and the guest workers?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Above all, to say the migration authority spokesman, is to reduce the number of forced labour.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"A lot of talk now about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
But their rights must be protected even before their departure.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Only an organized recruitment to 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.

<seg id="23">
Run into problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.

<p>
<seg id="24">
Sebelew is convinced that will face a future without knowledge of the language is necessarily bad people who, under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he stayed with dozens of months without food and documents and will work 12 to 14 hours a day.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"In the home is promised you one thing, and on arrival you cheated to, their passports and do not receive the promised wage" the head of the main administration labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.

<p>
<seg id="27">
Not having a go, boss!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, that they do not only the language of the country, but also to express themselves in their own language, in writing.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a sound basic education.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Because their families are not even money to feed the children, let alone them decent clothes, shoes and buy school clothes.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
These children then immediately as a teenager take the first opportunity for making money.

<seg id="32">
"It is difficult without language skills," they give.

"You feel humiliated and inferior."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Human rights activists say regarding the law following important aspect.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The test must only migrants with legal status.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
You do not have this status, there is no investigation and therefore no official work.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
"Welcome" or "Entry for unauthorised persons"
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Moreover, the of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for a year and a half thousand.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
The staff of the Russian police know that most of our documents and we are not registered, and this gives rise to cases of blackmail.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
"Just spare no expense for false papers"
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only can be falsified registration documents of migrants.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Some counterfeit certificates that the completion of the language tests, were beschlaggenommen by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
This, of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant three thousand rubles.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
That is the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that we can't buy the certificates are simple, both officials and civil rights activist.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers who fall for the first time the test, only promise that they have time for a course.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered in areas where there is no active communication with people.

Yet no one can predict whether the protests will even further or whether they are out of the air again soon.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-governmental organisations.
</seg>

In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.

On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, its work and Carnegie together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targets individuals with low and middle income.

<seg id="13">
That is why many of the paid Walmart employees buy only at the workplace.

The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart, one of the largest companies in the United States.

The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners.

The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution to the company health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month.

A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 a hour, could afford this increase, they said.

Currently, the minimum wage legislation under federal and New York at $7.25 a hour.

No one less than it deserves in this expensive city.

As it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me.

There was a time in which almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's stood behind the counter, but the young people were living with their parents.

Hardly anyone saw it is the main source of income or to stay there.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's always people who complain that they have with this wage and sometimes even to feed their children.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper the Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how it is to feed.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
Participants in the protests, which on Thursday at 6,30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants a minimum wage of $15 a hour, which is more than a doubling of the the current minimum wage.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
The U.S. law prevents the management to stand in the way of this objective and union members to admonish or to dismiss.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
On the other hand, does not make the management of them.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is, but also for objective reasons.

On this day, there were strident protests from many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including City Council member Juma said Williams, who said: "McDonald's said that it sell billions portions, and yet they'll be given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio candidate who said that "we should work together supporting the fast-food workers, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, deserves every New Yorker!."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.

But there were only a few hundred people on the ground, far from all of them are employed in the fast-food industry, in the working in New York tens of thousands of.

<seg id="15">
We must dismiss the computer world in our physical world and make it more.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
To this end, it is necessary not only to the user, but also its surroundings.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Then we could add to the real world much easier through virtual objects.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
And first and foremost, we should be this silly virtual reality helmets!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
- What do you think about language?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It is popular, but they are not overvalued?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because they would like to inform all others about his actions and intentions.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular niche.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
For example, we were working in the field of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and tight, rather than experimenting with sweeping gestures.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
These were not the gestures of the object camera, but from recorded by a bracelet that the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It is still relatively high, but in theory could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
But overall, however, such as the future belongs to mixed types of control, for example, gestures and language.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
- Like this?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
For example, we would ask you to reach out to you that Sprudeldose?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
They say it and, at the same time.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Normally, I would say it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
- That is, you want the user adjusts to what can't afford a machine at the time and what?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
I think that we in the near future, especially in the development of new types of sensors must be working that make it possible to collect responses from people.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
- What do you make claims based on your work with the Xbox, sensors on modern cameras?
</seg>
<seg id="37">
There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Of course, not 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
All current technologies are not good enough for us, the developers of the algorithms more work.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The speed and the number of images per second are important.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Stephen Betis, developed in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
I needed for my work as a device, only without the control and with more frames per second.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
- The number of cameras should not be increased?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
-, is currently working with three "cameras," which is one of them is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
It is not used to calculate the object.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
More cameras could solve the problem...
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Or exacerbate the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Nice is a flexible, similar system where we could play with different camera orientation, to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
- If I remember correctly, not Microsoft, Google, in contrast to his public spectacles.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Do you not think that, with regard to the application of the technology in everyday life the enlarged reality glasses of the best prospects?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
- Of course, it is not pleasant always on the to keep a smartphone in your hand, but I think the following: the best option would be a "temporary" enhanced reality in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
The lens is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but also its weakness, because an enlarged reality by means of glasses that you can work together with others in virtual objects.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortals.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
There is a problem, often point to the critics of this idea: there is no visible reaction.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
The hands feel nothing at all.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
What answers to give your group at this point?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
- In my lectures, I often talk about the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
I think the eighth breakthrough might well be the integration of taktilen perception.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
An interesting method is the use of second hand as something unusual projection.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It takes pressure perfectly true!
</seg>
<seg id="67">
But there are also technologies that are actually designed, in fact, the "pictures in the air" to give something concrete, for example, the interference by some of ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger, a feeling that is now so weak as someone einherjar over the control.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
There are also bands for the wrist on the nerve endings in the fingers, this is also a potential direction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">
- Have you tried to outflank the brain?
</seg>
<seg id="70">
We think that it can sense what it would feel if it sees something?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">
- This is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
Here is another challenge facing us is that we will have a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room, to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space, where we are working on plans with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
So far, the brain can outwit only moderately, and we still have many busy years.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
That is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: many issues we are at the beginning.

My own taste rather than of culture - rosbalt.ru
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Rosbalt project "Petersburg avant-garde" is dedicated to the city dwellers, which form the vanguard of the art and culture.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
On the select list already landed high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes beyond the borders of the city and often find the recognition in Europe, without being in the rest of Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, dressed in red clothed Bärtigen, the at the Russian Museum, sometimes in the summer garden, found at scene meetings or at openings.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Where are the images of Kirill Miller, attract large crowds issued.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socially philosophical artists, create new myths.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80 s or early 90 s.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is also a man of the city and its presence on the street by his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides them with good humour.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg hub organ player, because it is a difficult role in his artists, felt his philosophy and his image is finally ready.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
I have chosen the colour red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In this world is red the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In the society calls on everything what differs somewhat from the grey norm, aggression and bad behaviour.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
I want to come through my provocations with the people.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Any of my last provocation was an invitation to talk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
- When did you know that you have to be a painter?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
- An exhibition in the Palace of Culture News Khoryv, which was my work.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I realised that I have to go down this path.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter at the time, and new and free painter as I was incomprehensible.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
I am friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it "Pushkinskaya 10," and it was once.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The theater, fashion, music, in particular, in addition to the literature.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
- And all the united in your clinic... It was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where should gather the best new artist.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10 and there was up to the renovation a musically artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wearing tight shirts and to them as was the hottest composer Igor Wdowin today.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
As the group began to play live, was from the "Leningrad."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The mountain moderated many programmes before the time of "Halli Galli."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the fundamentals he learned from us.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The gallery "D" or "137 club" Griboedov "have their origin in the the clinic.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Our employees and guests.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In 2000 there was a poll in the press, the award "personalities of our city."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
I won in the category "artist of the year," and I was reached at the peak.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
It is not easy to work in new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
In this day and age, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: You can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
- Your work has a distinctive style.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
- Many of my pictures are true pearls and the timeliness and thoroughness of the idea.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
I am an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as clowns."
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Clowns are timeless.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Earlier I was socially, but now it pains and is afraid to be so.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
In all this a clown and loses his tragedy.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
For example, we save the world by specifying that everyone has to dress up in full.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Everyone is now on the clothes and the exterior and the interior of the people.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
But perhaps we should not be a human hand, but should he spit in the face.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The deception by dressing up.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A cultural city should have as a hero.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Who, if I fail?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
- Commercial art can also be beautiful?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
Today - must be careful commercial art, considerate and flattering.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Earlier, the large groups of people: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
I am not a hundred dollar bill, which will please everyone.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Now you have to consider you, if you will.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Every cult star now has about 100 followers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
- In the presence of Stas Michał Ilow but several thousand!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
- Come to him abandoned women, sexually plays a role in the social sphere.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
For cultural reasons, 300 individuals and 10 thousand, so there is less money management, and everything is.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not destroy what has been achieved.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
In my youth I have painted these pictures, which were in a collectors even in a number of the works of Falk and Lario Now.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
This is the culture that I support.
</seg>
</p>

<seg id="69">
- What is missing kirill Petersburg?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
- Good cultural experts.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
They say: Diener- culture.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
But not all of them can deal with culture.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
In the real czar, it was different, because a lot of culture, but they understood that are perhaps not the right experts.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
In St. Petersburg, we have what might be the experts, but they are blocked by the way, because it takes hochrangigerer experts, the former properly assess and pave the way for them.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
Now, only one's own taste.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say honestly that they are not all contemporary art and therefore need to find some painters to adopt other museums.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">
- What is for you?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
- St. Petersburg, the Capital of culture in Moscow; there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
On our stones can grow art is difficult.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
We need a cultural ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
In Europe, there are many people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
We have a lot less.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.

"Finally, no one answered that question," says space veteran Tang Watschnadse.

In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.

We have only very few cosmonaut, where after long flights go well and they got healthy offspring.

"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Poliakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.

And yet the human race for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.

The water is the weightlessness.

<seg id="53">
Although adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel water as a natural element.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony that rose from life on the ocean.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get easier to water.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
In principle this is logical, since from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
While for a newborn child is the weightlessness of a much more natural state, is not the woman without gravity.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles very quickly and so that is the ability to extract the child.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tools.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
For example, the birth could take place in a special chamber in order to extract the child.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
"But what happens then?" Is not the important issue of Valery Poliakov.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Without feeling the gravitational pull of the organism can form the skeleton and muscles.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
A newborn child could not be put in orbit as an adult for training in a.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
He is just missing what is of fundamental importance to his life.

<seg id="67">
"This experiment that we make together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will lead to a disabled person, a complete non-conformist will bring people to the world," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.

Nkú chief: control of the Black system through the fault of the failed policy
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The Czech Republic, in the context of public contracts on good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, but in their application.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
In the conversation for Aktuá ln.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme control office (Nejvyí kontrolní úad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"A law is never perfect, but it must be used correctly - and I think this is not the case with us," said of the current situation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
A similar result is to be a common control by Czech and German firms.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
As bad practice on the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "Black system."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would annoy the entrepreneurs with controls - so the system is banned or permitted?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then simply cannot come from the government's chairman, and the monitoring office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work," Kala.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common Czech / German project, the both countries "laws on public contracts.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
What was it?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
It is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Simply put, it is important that establishes the European legislative to handle public contracts to build the national legislations, and finally, there is the real practical application..
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps a little "strict and perfect," but the actual application is in Germany in some parameters better.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
This confirms that it is not new, and more detailed rules. We must deal with the actual application of the law.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
How can you help the project for you? What emerges from this project?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
It is precisely this kind of joint control could help to stop us constantly to the laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds, if this did not seem particularly positive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to buy and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
It may even be that the system in this way, only the excessive burden "paperwork" and those who look for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold values higher.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
How does the control system in Germany?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
To as far as the authorities, the German counterpart the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us, and also on a college, which will be formed only slightly different. Basically, both authorities are similar.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, a federal state, which means that there is also in the individual federal states - is the German system is different from ours.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The BRH can only monitor federal funding, which is our state funds.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Public funds is managed by the counties and municipalities, are subject to the control of the national courts of auditors.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
As regards the German legislation is easier than ours?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
In general I would compare it without specifics reluctant. Nevertheless Germany is in some ways, often described as a model, but say that Germany in particular is better.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
That is because the auditors are better?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
That is certainly not, but I don't particularly like, such comparisons.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It should be noted here that even those countries that have a model for us, are also struggling with problems.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, isn't it?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
As regards the Czech legislation, your authority had the revision of the procurement law, do you feel any impact?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
As our controls, you have to be here with some delay.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
Impact we feel in the preparatory phase of the future controls - we have the new instrument of control "detection of risks of inefficiency" and examined with this almost 14,000 public contracts and here, the changes will affect change, of course, the threshold values, modified the conditions for certain types of contracts, etc.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
It may occur, however, the problem is that the rules be "tough" and can no longer be met.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Under the previous rules are that they a Prfung underlined people against the carrier (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) an are not accountable to any breach of the public procurement law a violation of budgetary discipline.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
But it is to make the law more stringent?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
I do not believe that in this way.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not to punish those who have made a formal errors, which does not affect the actual decision-making.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
Where is the solution?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
We say first of all, what is not the.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs would bother with controls of the so-called "Black system" - what does that mean exactly?
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The system is banned or permitted?
</seg>
<seg id="49">
A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then simply cannot come from the government's chairman, and the monitoring office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
He can say: "we will change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do so, as if it were nothing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded due to procedural errors alone.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly - and that is what we are lacking.

The band the T T, together with other performers also the so-called anthem against the world with the title "world comes from."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will resound to the benefit concerts?
</seg>

Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and will not take place in the world...

It has transpired that are most interested in cooperating with us, and have fun.

For the establishment of the accessible education center Studeo, on which we are already working together with the club six years T in Jedlika Institute.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The students of the Jedlika Institute are regularly by teachers who help them in different leisure activities.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
As the students themselves do not have the resources to go to the, we want to help them in this way.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In the context of the completion of the Jedlika Institute is intended to create a separate building, in which we move with this project.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
At every concert several groups and performers.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
According to what criteria you have chosen?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In Prague, for example, China Yovkov enter support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The T T, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Everything else you on the website www.kpks.cz.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Similar "big events" are planned for the future?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Next year we want to be like in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Their overseas plans are not small, you already have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The T T is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
How do you deal with these logistical and organisational trips?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold. We also need to haul many instruments suitcase and other luggage...
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Nevertheless, it always worked without problems, SA and British Airways were always prepared very well for us, that I have sometimes surprised some.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
Through your foreign trips you have to compare the situation in the various countries with, as there are people with disabilities, etc.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
As you have seen these things?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were witnessing in Russia in the East, that is still in its infancy.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
To Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, where it is still unusual, if someone is in a wheelchair in the city centre.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
It is not yet, of course, that vorlässt a wheelchair users, for example, in the elevator.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Fortunately, there are also clubs that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
There are many things on which we depend on...
</seg>
<seg id="53">
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation of the efforts of those concerned.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal for people with severe disabilities self-cut move in public space, go to the museum can use toilets etc.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
But it is not usual that actively participates in a larger group of disabled people in the public arena, we are with the band the T T slightly ahead of the West.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when one of our own worldleading athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, are things really start to change.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly determined personalities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
The T T is currently very popular. But if we go back a couple of years: What was your motivation in 1998 to get a band?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
Then I began as a supervisor in the Jedlika Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
And since I myself am musicians and, together with a colleague, I have a music AG.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
Oh, and over time, as the moderator, Láa Angelovi, likes to say, a little out of control (laughs).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
The band became known in recent years, would you?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us, and we have started to campaign actively for us.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
We are discovering that if something does not work and this is externally, there is no merit in a sense.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
Thanks to EU funding, we can also be good editors, quality equipment and the like.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
Was it your goal to make it with The T T?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">
From the beginning, I felt the potential that we can do things differently.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
In show business today often copied to the other.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
This is logical, because its own way everything new with caution and is accepted only after a long time.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that T T.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
The first impression that the audience usually has, of course, is a pity; it is only natural.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned, we should regret.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
I always say that if people with disabilities something, not just for them is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a tough boss, as we hear from many people?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">
If you want to make something good, we must make no compromises on many things, and we should also ask for a certain discipline.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
But I think this is completely normal.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and when they realise they have twice a week, must undertake preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm among many quickly extinguished.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
So it works everywhere, in every band who do the work and wants to achieve something.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">
Currently, The T T twenty members.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
How many of them from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
Only one: Láa Angelovi.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
We are an open group. People come and go, that cannot prevent.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.

Poland and the space.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Poland was admitted last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member States of the European space Agency (ESA) as a member of this space easy authority. Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which took place on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Poland began in 1994 and participated in a close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA projects in the next several years.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The path of Poland into space, however, began much earlier.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Even before the Second World War II Polish space enthusiasts with the space, and they were not always understanding.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I remember of the lecture by A. ternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, which the author thought from his pioneering work "entrance to the cosmonautics."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) but the audience cold, and after years ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had only shown interest in his work.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Ternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the cosmonautics" by Robert Esnault Pelttari and André Louis Hirsch, Prix REPS Hirsch.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been acknowledged by, among other things, that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.

In 1925 was built in Poland a railway trolley, which was planned for a rocket engine.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The author of the draft, and the details of this project have unfortunately been unknown.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or the brakes of the trolley.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The information can come only from the contemporary press.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
In 1933 the Polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen purpose-as began.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The research, the Institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
From the documents show that the research was down to the stage of practical tests.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
But the research was then interrupted by the invading German Wehrmacht.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
In 1937, in the press of. Rohoziski originating draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, he joined the "raki 生Eta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Both projects dealing with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology from passing scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of work has been finished his work by the beginning of the war.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Another article on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The first mention of this company is 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major articles of the space.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to a space company.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At the time there was the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that would have the space exploration future.

Even at its inception in 1956, the Polish space Society PTA membership based on the 1951 International Federation for space, and indeed, the PTA in autumn 1956 member.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The following year was the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy chairman of the International Federation for space.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
This post he held until his death in 1959.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Since 1956, the PTA took part in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (raki Eta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The first type, 1, was completed in 1957, the first race took place on 10 October 1958.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was 80 cm long and weighed just 5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Later, an improved version, the brillantes 1 A, built, and 1959 in the Bledowska Desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket más brillantes 2.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
A further stage of development should be able to make real scientific work - the rocket más brillantes 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the observation of high-altitude winds.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In 1962, but, has been halted further development.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Successor to the first missiles of the type RM was developed in the years 1962 to 1965 Meteor- 1 rocket.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length of 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
From this developed three types (Meteor- 1 A, 1 B and - 1 C), which manifested in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The Meteor- 1 a rocket had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor- 1 B 0.34 litre and Meteor- 1 C for 0.62 litres.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The maximum altitude for all three types of 37 km.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
In the years 1965 to 1968 was developed in the aviation institute which Meteor- 2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Meteor- 2 has a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
After the versions were built Meteor- 2 H and Meteor- 3.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Also worth mentioning is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in space research with Soviet satellite, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Hermaszewski current legislation after the Czechs second interwetten cosmonaut Vladimir Remek.

The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Last week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
That decision provoked a lively debate among the public.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It is interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with each other.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The this is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) leads to price.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper imported goods in economic competition, by undercutting the competition "" in order to grab a larger market share and to increase its profits.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This means on a large scale for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with high labour costs.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Because private capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for what he is necessarily caused unemployment, rising government spending.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the damage they have caused overall economic and social damage.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In other words: governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of the private sector, particularly in the field of wages.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
This is done through economic coercion in long-term unemployment, partly by reducing workers "rights.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In Germany there have been several years since public food outlets for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive a salary so low that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag revealed auxiliaries.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The austerity measures virtually all the EU southern states will no doubt be on the same condition, which people are being forced under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels, to emigrate (as in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society and hope that at some private investment capital flow into the country.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Here, the question naturally arises as to how this capital?
</seg>
<seg id="26">
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all for a fraction of the European wages.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
This applies to all of Latin America.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam claim that the state must not be involved with capital in its own economy, and that a planned economy to economic disaster.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Private capital narrowly insists on his position that the state should not intervene to direct the economy.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Then you have to wonder whether the policy does not affect private capital and the entire state in their own selfish interests or draws.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Here is the clear answer: yes.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, legislation in virtually anything criminal, but nothing is punishable.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In Germany, the reality is that a State Department for lack of finances private, with the industry of legal businesses with the drafting of legislative proposals.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
All violence is no longer the people from the western constitutions, as, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Obviously the liberal democracies are currently a situation that Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar's and "describes:" the state has been understood for a long time in the, and the offices were occupied by force.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Against bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Corruption has grown unchecked, and the people with boughted votes went to the polls ..."" people with character not applied for posts as a result of this decline for eight months, so that the state had no consul ..."" You really began to talk about it, that is the only medicine an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man ..." Appian thought is to be in, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, democracy permanently replaced by the autocracy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
As it turns out, is today's society, as well as in ancient times based on of the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without looking at overall societal interests.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Private capital by its very nature, is not in a position to see the benefit of society as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The result, now, as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, who are not in the slightest for deeper reforms.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The cause for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the indiscriminate liberalisation of of the economies in the 19th and 20th century look.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Of the, the regime in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, in the next round.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Especially appalling is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The repeal of the law on voluntary work is no solution, at least not lasting.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the level of social security of the population.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
This trend is a systemic nature.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the state.

The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip themselves to this (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, but in the meantime, the central Bank of Russia's government has).

The first war aimed to eliminate the big royalist states, Europe should be broken by the second war, in particular Britain's colonial rule, and the third war to reduce the world's population to around 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and luxury and would not use so many resources), create an universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power.

This change in the film's mood levels - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence showing iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
</seg>
<seg id="21">
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, therefore, the ironic and slightly exaggerate.

Ben Affleck succeeded with this film a remarkable start to his career.

Argo is his third feature film in the no children (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).

At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in the local Boston by director.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that contrasted this director's previous films from the Hollywood standard.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Affleck demonstrates this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The best scenes of the in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have taken place - the main sequence of the storming of the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and it conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when signalizations moves the story.

A similar effect Affleck and his team also in fictional scenes (the wrong film crew at a bazaar in Tehran).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Too much plot in too many places
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
But he working with the little, but sometimes he nachhilft reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which will avert the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or the chase on the runway, the most fun).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The weakness of Argo is his overly broad distribution, which is due to the need to show too much to act in too many places.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, their figures but deserved more space, but they are in the film is far from alone.
</seg>

<p>

Afflecks film loses a little traction. It is a movie, with some interest, and the design and the age of a thriller from 70 to approve years. Without style.

A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons in the sale by saying that children under eight years not inflate the balloon without supervision of an adult.

"The people that I want to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," said Okamura.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Mr Senator, how to get the idea to run for the presidency?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
It is not about me, senator or president.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
If everything would work in our country without problems, I would run anywhere.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But I can no longer look at how plundered the Republic for 20 years, as thieves, while increasing people's taxes and the retirement age.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
But if I see something that I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
And while I am over 40, and independent and party-less, I have no other way to influence things, a senator or presidential candidate.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
In the Senate, you have made it and then straight on the road to the castle.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
You do not turn our backs on your constituents?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
I told me the whole time that I will take the fight to for the castle on the outcome of the Senate elections.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This later clarified and I said that I will run for the presidency, if I am elected senator.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
My goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realise my vision.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The problem is not just that we, as people in the pub and in front of the television, but anyone who wants to change something.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
To confuse then there are the media who want to the, and to lie with the freedom of speech and freedom.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
About me, it was said, for example, that I would impress journalists or that I was an adviser by Jiří Paroubek.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
We talk about your vision.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The struggle for the castle you have included with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retrospective asset declarations about 20 million crowns.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
You have to change laws.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
How do you solve this problem?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
As a simple citizen, I have endeavoured to keep the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The problem is the small-minded politics - someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, that's not on purpose, and that keeps the population only.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
As an independent party, I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in parliament.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
My advantage is that I can take without drawers thinking and party dogma of each party what is the best for our country.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
You see as a person in the policy right or left?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
For me, this left-right thinking but totally irrelevant.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
For me, it is important that we make progress.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
My point is not whether people on the left or the right, I would like to unite the people.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
I always support any good approach, even if it comes from the KSM or the ODS, and even so will I go against bad ideas.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
It you, if someone calls you as populists.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
But do not confirm it by what you have just said?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
If you add in a company a business plan, then you have an ideal goal and a vision.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
And that you want to move.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
You can call it as far as populism, but all the proposals, which I have spoken to work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
But without support in Parliament telepad remain just slogans.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
And so that you are not in politics in the long term.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Or do you think that you, if you talk long enough with the people will be able, for example, the material and impose criminal liability?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
I have no other option.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them to our side, to achieve these goals.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
As president, it would be no problem for me to ask the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
And the home-owners may then have to say why they reject.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
A strong personality, which refers to irregularities, can put pressure on the political scene.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Take the direct election of the President, who was a credit to the public pressure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
I say very clearly that I am an amateur and I am neither a genius nor an intellectuals.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
I started with the policy and just trying to find my programme for the support of the majority.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
I always try to assess the situation for themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I am in six years in the private sector.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
That sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
I am not a savior.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
I know that I do not alone, and that is why I have spoken with several famous people on whether they want to run for the Senate.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
For example, I have spoken with Radim Janura, but rejected due to.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the fraud in the sale of light fuel oil.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">
My candidacy, I began with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the polls, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that will be very difficult to implement changes.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
Do you think about setting up your own party?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
I have not thought about it, because I don't have the time to review the past every potential party member, and not have the money.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
I have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account for only 20,000 CZK.

In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Kodu Superb, which is worth about one million. And and then I have a few million in the account.

The Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he was driving in the car, gallantly to women, and fighting against evil.

You are driving an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
</seg>
<seg id="70">
They say that you want to change the Republic, but you do not want to invest your own money.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
That is not very convincing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
Should I do about debt?
</seg>
<seg id="74">
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that the my program probably does not too much interest.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
And I am not obliged to make the campaign from its own resources.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
The cost of the campaign will gedecktVVPP basically through my salary as a senator.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
But the senators salary, I could not live alone; I could not fund my son the English school, which costs Euro30,000 per month.

If I wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.

Stay as long as an entrepreneur, to have your livelihood?
</seg>
<seg id="81">
You said that you will return these activities?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
But that does not depend on the level of salary.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
As promised, I have reduced my activities.

<seg id="84">
For example, is my deputy CEO of the travel agents in the spring,.

Monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur?

Szabo: "Germans must play bigger role."
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S. European relations, Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
German first wave: Germany earlier this week had indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the beginning of the United Nations.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But then abstained.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Why?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Now must be Germany due to its special relationship with Israel.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This was enforced by NATO.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Germany is finding it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Yes, that is true.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
That is because it is surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States, as it were, to a German foreign policy.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
To make matters worse, that Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
So the Germans find themselves trapped in the middle.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is expected them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I think that they their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A foreign policy, as France or Britain.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
What does a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
It shows a willingness to take positions in on national interests, which are independent of the United States or European partners.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and therefore needs to protect its interests.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
These economic interests have had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
We must be careful, the public, but also the elites, not to in the Arab countries.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
It definitely plays a role.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by abstaining from the vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
I believe in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic breakthrough, as in the Libyan issue.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Perhaps even Germany will record a certain respect.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Because it signals that it will be taken seriously as an international player and must be given to its interests.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The United States have come out clearly in favour of a veto.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
There are differences between the U.S. and many European nations?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
As a result of American domestic politics have always existed.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
But due to the political situation, the government can not this position publicly, of course.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all talking about Netanyahu's policies.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
It is difficult to Germany's close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
I think that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead push things from their own position.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
This is precisely what they do with the euro.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future to push Europe into an European position.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
This has always been a sensitive issue.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
But I believe that the Germans know that they must play a more independent role.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a major role?
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Germany is still the lead or difficult?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
Germany is still not yet been used, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a greater role in the country.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti- German feelings.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
This is the old problem: You want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
Germany is seen in a much more difficult position than the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
Now, the influence of the United States continually in European politics, the EU does not fill the vacuum at the moment but who is?
</seg>
<seg id="62">
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Even if they do not like, it makes them uncomfortable and it is even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Trademark protection" in China: If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese.

<seg id="2">
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.

<seg id="3">
But what Armani Polo?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A designation officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original company.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
However, as long as it enjoys protection, the actual name donors do not complain.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
And even then it is not clear whether they will get justice.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas stalemate hole, a lawyer in the law firm Taylor Wessing, which is in the Far East.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
A new case every week ends up on my desk.

<p>
<seg id="9">
The clones are already a few extra letters, so that they can register their brands.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
So Gucci, Prada gives simply Lu Gucci, Prada Kny you enter.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
German companies are legally copied in this way, for example, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Stalemate hole opens a folder with the of the trademark Office in Beijing.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protecting the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.

<seg id="15">
In the big cities, there are mehrstöckige department stores that sell almost exclusively.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
But the cases are different: his clients he goes against that Chinese companies receive officially have from the Trademark Office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Chinese call the "bang Jian-Ming Pai," a passenger.

"That is, we must fight will jeopardize it," says stalemate.

<seg id="22">
"The brand will, the lone position, the image damage is enormous."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
According to the market research company CLSA is China, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But deletions dubious trademark registry entries are hard to reach and go into money.

The process can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.

Stalemate hole reported cases in which the court lawsuit claims, because after the long duration of the disputed name to "market reality."

Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.

<seg id="30">
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.

To date, the Chinese must therefore use a logo similar to the Mercedes star.

As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.

Last year, when CTMO went more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.

This is the tenth consecutive year, a record and that give China the list of applications around the world, shares the authority.

In the next two instances Freudenberg was right, but the process opponents fighting.

Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.

But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and is costing us a lot of time, money and nervous."
</seg>
<seg id="59">
The internal cost could be difficult to quantify, the company's archive had to look arcives even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
</seg>

Five years ago, a "high six-figure euro amount" in Freudenberg the other side to settlement.

Then, if there territory.What Doubles vulnerable brands.

<seg id="64">
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration.

Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole advising German companies to be very careful in dealings with China.

It is not enough to rely on international brands, but the foreigners "everything is somehow worth protecting, but also in China," says Wentzler.

Otherwise, much more expensive than the registration.

In fact, if Freudenberg last act of his trademark drama, then you would have to pay the other side licence fees for their own name, said Wentzler.

Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but around the world.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The secret of the success of the country have to do something with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Take a selection of overripe cheese varieties.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It platziere them a pile of dirty, humid sports clothing.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
And leave it there for a week.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
So the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which just won't go away.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you would have stinky fish - in water up to a year.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The darkness over the land, and the weather is colder in Norway, Norwegian at a festival in Fagernes, now, that this is really very eye-catching speciality.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
"You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk General" organized the festival.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take on large quantities of alcohol.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Harvard.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The spirit can crowd out the smell.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I eat some.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Avoiding the Rakfisk in, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no cooling opportunities and was soaked fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In the deepest winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of theRule subdued - consumed alcohol.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Even a generation ago had thousands of Norwegians in search of work, to leave their country and mainly in the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not so long ago was far richer than Norway, are immigrants.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He is one of the more expensive meals, which can be bought here.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs $10.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Still, to name Anders Breivik hates it here - those racist right-wing extremists, who last year 77 men, women and children shot.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Instead, it referred only to the "incident on 22 July."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is in its peace-loving country to such brutal killings.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien since the early 1970 s, the growth of the world.

"But oil is not the only reason why we are so good," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with enthuse Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes the Nordic ideal.

<seg id="34">
We are not, we may not redeem your boasting.

Norway has been very cautious with its oil wealth - a large proportion of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.

<p>
<seg id="36">
As in the years leading up to the world economic crisis all money around, they had not hielt Norway.

"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.

<seg id="38">
"And, of course, Rakfisk," it deals with easy laughter.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
I am standing in the snow and another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
So a moose burgers is something else. The juicy meat goes down me.

<p>
<seg id="41">
But on the evening of Stinkefisch is back on the menu.

<seg id="42">
The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several locations that organise a Rakfisk dinner where guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - can vote fish smell sense of.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
There is a live TV circuit with a fly at show, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"

We applauded laughs.

On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto as president, and take over the leadership of the nation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
He faces a complex task.

</p>
<p>

Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon's Mexico has to prove itself economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the past six years.

<seg id="9">
"My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office U.S. President Barack Obama.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
I will propose a new security strategy, we can achieve this goal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Before he went to the U.S. president on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In this densely populated, large part of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided on the new head of state.

He was a very direct guy, very committed and have big plans for the country.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He was a great statesman, but above all, he is someone who can listen to.

<p>
<seg id="25">
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The place is hidden under Autobahnüber tours and, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.

Navarre popotte believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
On a recent trip to Mexico City I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, wide.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Signs pointed to two queues, one for "Mexican Wochos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Number" ("foreigners").
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
I stood there for a few seconds, to which I should go.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
I grew up in Central California and has been all my life, "Mexicans."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
An ethnic symbol - just am friends in Boston "Irish" or "Italians" call my friends in New York.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Later, I opted for "Mexican" / ."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
But this was Mexico.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or binding.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
I was just Americans.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to say in this language at both ends of an interview.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not go.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for registration.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
I thought about that moment this week, as did the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the White House to meet with President Obama.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
On the agenda were all those issues which are expected to meet the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Pena Nieto was also very keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans remain today, with a high degree of probability in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc after the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Mexico's Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Most Americans probably never waste a single idea that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and forced the country's leadership under vorgehaltenem gun to leave them more than half of its territory.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
But for Mexicans who think in centuries rather than in minutes, the memories of this event.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
So once, an U.S. government official mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites, the country's - complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour's.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
And the Monte Zuma's children on the.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
And yet, in truth, is the biggest challenge in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Want to talk about?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
There are more than enough.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - offered no chance in Mexico, and in the north.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In Mexico.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
And while we may be living the American dream, good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Our identity is blurred at times, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
This is certainly the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
This is based on reciprocity.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and looking down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never strong enough.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
They believe our existence is a symbol of failure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
If not failed our families in Mexico, they would have.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
And then we would not be caught behind the silk curtain now see - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and einwanderte legally as a child in the United States, I am reminded that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans blame them.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
While it is an U.S. citizen, as part of two countries.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling of, neither one nor the other country.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
And we are seen as Mexicans in the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes it even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education and want to record their links to the diaspora.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
They want to Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
Now.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
This will not happen.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Too many wounded feelings.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
And given the unjust distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
I am afraid, because you alone,.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">
This is fair.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a year and a half centuries, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a, for what happened to their family members so long ago.
</seg>

<p>
<seg id="62">
Hmmm).
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
There can be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the bud.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Amid the usual recriminations countless buildings in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed and six Israelis - and, for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the the holy city of Jerusalem.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But there are reasons to believe that could find the deadly standoff finally end.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
A war that neither will be won or lost
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
At first glance seems appropriate given the current situation is optimistic.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, have strengthened the this week's fighting hardcore on both sides.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis, although his group even suffered heavy losses.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Although several Hamas leaders killed and packed the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet, Israel has failed so far to destroy Hamas.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Indeed, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has to hold powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once known as well as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah power over Syria, where rebels could be an increasingly islamistischeren character before the Stürzung Bashar Assad, to to Jordan, where Hamas is threatening allies of the king.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
And, in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the most densely populated and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 2011 30 years until his overthrow, had little time for Hamas.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
By contrast, the Brotherhood is out with Hamas and its leaders more popular views.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove Hamas as a player that can't be squeezed out of Israel and the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Israeli hardliners, however, to draw the opposite conclusion.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Military terms, however, that Hamas is no longer a threat.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep peacefully.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In diplomatic terms, the United States has been steadfast in their position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the industry, which hineinverlaufen in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared for international law, however, be.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud Party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren group.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Why is this cunning Palestinians cuddled and handed them their own state?
</seg>
<seg id="33">
If they had, the control of the West Bank, just like their in Gaza, then it would not fire rockets?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and to punish, should they dare to raise their heads.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
It may be able to the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could make them.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will focus initially on the difficulties in their own country.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbours.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to its economy.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Israelis should think long-term.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which is undoubtedly will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, exploded as a bus in Tel Aviv this week.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only worsen the situation.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand over the years increasing its diplomatic toll.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Both sides need a push from outside
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
The answer is that the the more reasonable members of both parties, which most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states, which Israel is stepping down for security purposes.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The - in the near future small - hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt must now stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and Hamas is better positioned than ever to the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of 1967 borders, with land swaps, and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state, with the forthcoming request for U.N. observer status.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
Obama must do its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
During his first term he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also participating.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Australian for single cigarette packaging laws come into force

Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packets, which are equal for all tobacco brands

The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging in Australia have come into force. This brand logos and colors neutral, replaced by olive green lid, which are accompanied by with drastic images that diseased body parts and cigarette smoke show, infants and children.

Apart from the different health warnings and images from next Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are identical, are printed in small letters.

<seg id="5">
So that leads Australia the world's most stringent rules on tobacco packaging.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
</seg>

It is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not started to smoke will not start with 26, with 99% probability accordingly.

"You can see in children younger age that they understand the message that the tobacco companies trying to compete with their brand image," federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of an of a princess.

Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar steps.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It was said that the laws would encourage the black market trade, which lead to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.

A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, they are not allowed to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to interpret cigarettes in shops longer. Now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sides.

"Who sells tobacco and has only a small area, in order to promote its products, not the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.

<seg id="22">
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has noted an increase in reports to brands, the of "ordinary people" have been written.

In an ever elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored

This Thanksgiving unexpectedly I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another plane.

But a growing number of academics and child development experts boredom as something positive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
So far as they are concerned, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
So that the brain is forced to get caught up in interesting thoughts, which promotes the creativity.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And since rigid nowadays most of us almost constantly on the one or other screen, the benefits of boredom.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?

<seg id="11">
Yes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And no.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
I will come back again.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Bore Cathedral: A Lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"Indeed, the boredom of a very long history," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, going back to the first century.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that in many ways been defined and discussed is boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Professor Eastwood and his colleagues after a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people came to the conclusion that boredom than the experience, "to be able to do a satisfactory job, but it is not define."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, in such a way that is not the person, but I want to be.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "the process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Boredom can almost hear as depression.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But Professor Eastwood believes, although they could be two things, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have just difficult to concentrate.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
In their study, "the Unengaged mind: Defi Ning Bore Cathedral in terms of attention" - to: "the idle mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science "was, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, the participants listened to a tape in which a person read a magazine article.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard these sounds at all.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
The people who heard the barely audible television, said to have more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for it and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
If you put a monotonous work, "as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, can distract music and help to not feel bored."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may even combat this by physical persons remain attentive.
</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">
"Studies have shown that children who must learn herumhampeln, more and more information than those who are forced to remain seated," says Professor Fenske.

All of us will ever be boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly tedious film.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But some people bored more easily than others.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
To measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980 s on a "scale of boredom vulnerability."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
On the scale found statements such as "there are a lot of things that I have to do, and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Researchers have found that boys with of such abradability more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially, with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
But in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter clusters.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and doing the homework bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
But only 3% of parents said to feel bored.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he does not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
But he was sure that "youth is seen as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily routines.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
So back to my original question: is boredom healthy?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it leads people to extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to alleviate it, studies have shown.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is a professor Vodanovich, who researched the subject for more than two decades.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
"With the boredom of the brain to say that we should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
But the brain does not always know what to do it best.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
If a boring and energy to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But television can provide for happiness in the short term, but these evaporate in the long term.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
So who is his bored child an iPad, it can distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske..
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
And he adds: "self-regulation is transferred from one situation to another."
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Not only the child learns to talk, but also in other areas more self-control.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
I do not believe that we should celebrate.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
We should do not see it too critical.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Instead, our objective should be to feel at of permanent Aktivitäts and technology.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Professor Eastwood agrees.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
"It sounds so we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
He believes that people are looking for a way to switch off and relax in truth only.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in southeast Colorado for a crime to justice, which will be in this country legally soon: the possession of a few of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The said that he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was cited for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - excusable peccadilloes that are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and has a court date.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"We are treated like criminals," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But he is also a?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of minor drug offenses, less by the law, as the location.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Hundreds of the offences that revolve around marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, already approved similar measures, dropped.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The police authorities are adults over 21 years longer for possession on a small scale. This is allowed by law, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced that existing marijuana offenses, and people are still quoting in court.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains on new to prevent state licensed marijuana shops in the opening in their communities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
"This situation is evolving so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. resigned, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
And regulators in Washington State loss scratch on the head.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that in any case, most states Colorado, with regard to the regulation of marijuana was only legalized the drug for medical purposes and then for private consumption.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state lends itself so well to," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the for spirits in the state of Washington.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
The Washington law, known as I- 502, enters into force on 6 December and at the end of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not exist yet, but it is legalized the possession.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
And unpleasant practice questions need to be addressed in this time around, as the government's target of a "fair access" to lizenziertem marijuana beeps with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds should be agreed and childcare facilities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
"It will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal cannabis," a recently formed research group.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
On 21 November, sent his staff in Aurora Chief resigned in an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would not pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years, and that the police "will not seek prosecutions for such offences.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The police chief resigned added that will continue to enforce the rules regulating growers of medical marijuana and urban targets would continue to pursue drug traffickers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
In Weld County in northern Colorado County prosecutor Ken Buck represents a harsher view.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdrawal.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
To date, 119 people have been charged for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have been charged for other offenses.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute offences, to the point of the," Buck said in a statement.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
The reactions are themselves in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, does not adults for the possession of small quantities for longer.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
District prosecutor Pete Hautz Reißinger supported this decision, but decided not to drop all outstanding possession proceedings.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
"I do not think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it is changing," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the outset that it would not be easy, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Among local officials, and the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
In county prosecutors if it were a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for marijuana offenses the in court, and local acts as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
"They have spent such a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for it, that they cannot accept the legalization still," he believes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
As the first states to deal with the small quantities of marijuana like alcohol, traded Colorado and Washington as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
While advocates and state officials an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
For the legalization movement hope that will give the Ministry of Justice.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states large part.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama administration believes that no doors are likely to law enforcement officials to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but probably will resist, under the new legislation to allow legal, state-regulated marijuana shops.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Several cities in Colorado not wait to see the federal authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Even before the election day, some local administrations moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although it could open in about a year.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
"We would not be to get someone in a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Our community has voted against the legislation.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
We have done this for what it has not the government and then, for what was decided by the state.

Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am Tory
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Not only university students of today are being attacked for her views
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="3">
It was always my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought to the largest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - did.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College at the end of the eighties -, I had intended to study history - I had packed my suitcase and brought about the first scandal of my life.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
My father broke down in tears.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
My friends were confused.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I had a problem that had students in neighboring rooms.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The author of A N Wilson said, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
But the truth was less amusing.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
I ran away.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
We were harassed me for one reason only - a that seemed in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment to so narrow and cruel: My late father now Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I advocate of the Conservative Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Why do I mention this now?
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Now, recent reports indicate is a new generation of students of the moderate rights under similar prosecution.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week called for the same protection, equality of gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said that they are often isolated because of their political views "active, attacked personally and declared undesirable."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
They are calling for a place in the equality Nominierungskomitee their college to ensure that their views can be expressed freely.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students screened on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It has been shown, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association at the University of Oxford, who drove an and silver suit and silberbesetztem Go flaunted Tock.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Conservative students at other universities say they are as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing tendency to link universities.

People say we are like the cyber-bulling Don club, without us ever get to have. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie, Ill, says the President of the conservative student association of Oxford, they have seen members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
In my first weeks in Oxford I was such a minority.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
As I was unbelievably timid 18-year-old in September 1986.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Last year the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student - to give due to cuts in higher education has no official title.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The atmosphere could have been even Stalinists.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In the first days of the week, get to know the new students and tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
I made the experience that the the mockery of Tory students only tolerated, but even with joy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Political issues such as the miners "strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English. On what should have been, I was not taken.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."

Pitt was a small man with a face like a pie dough, and quite unpleasant.

"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are you just stupid?" He asked me.

<p>

"I know who you are," he said.

Unfortunately, it is, as it is.

For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be for you.

I insisted that I was not entirely agree with Mrs Thatcher.

This trick should prove unsuccessful.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
A first-year professional philosophy, politics and economy, which, ironically, had visited as a conservative force Eton College, said to me: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."

The only tutor, who announced himself as a Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in matters of foreign policy advice and had written speeches for them.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
He was rarely there.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist deterministic historical perspective.

I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with open-minded friends and family members in the city.

He seemed incredulous.

"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.

Even my Communist friends, always impeccable manners.

Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to pressure and put his convictions.

<seg id="84">
During a Tutoriums in the following week, which claimed another history tutor, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.

<seg id="85">
Although I zerging secretly in shame, I saw that my parents had a "brainwashing," and called them "old idiots."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">
The relief lasted only briefly.

<seg id="87">
It was my father, who was the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.

<seg id="88">
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">
My door was closed.

<seg id="90">
I hid in my room, and after five minutes gave my Reaver.

Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This has the designer at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture," a grandiose retrospektive, for the more than 130 haute Couture clothes of his "Maison" have been created in the last 50 years.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.

This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist "il signore" is Garavani, but not without its clients could have been written.

There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally in hell.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by recruiting them sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.

He has extracted large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths of stone.

<seg id="7">
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, with the balance and must put their steps carefully so that they do not slip and fall.

Key issues

</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Marie Los Porras, a teacher of English with university degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"The Internet was created as a vehicle for the search for information, with the release of these pages have changed the rules of the game but," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in education at Yale University and the author of "digital natives and Immigrants," these words to explain the phenomenon.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The digital natives, they are children and young people who grew up with this technology.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"We are the digital immigrants that they should teach, where we learn even more," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
He says that it is a complex issue, "because we demand that they have a defined criteria about what should be published or said, in an age where the maturity is not sufficient."
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"They should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be popular to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach children and young people, which is what privacy, to ask them questions that brings them food for thought.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
"To tell you not to do it, does not work," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
Porras then lists several options: There are things that you don't tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet?
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Or, if you like if you published a photo of you, as it was released from a friend?
</seg>
<seg id="51">
You know what you publish the other?
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Have you asked for the others advance permission, if you have labelled pictures of celebrations?
</seg>
<seg id="53">
And another question: Is all know what you're doing in each moment?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
A further point is to give them that they must act online, as they do offline.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
They are the same rules.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
"Someone outside of the Internet is with respect, decency and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he says.

"South America must learn to the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that a goal is the creation of a common citizenship, and "South America can learn something from Europe."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Correa, who is the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru, that the Europeans "killed in the Second World War and other conflicts" and "are now virtually a fatherland."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, the members countries of the Unasur.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; but there is still a reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on human rights.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Those who teach, never commit to something, and in exchange we sign the South Americans.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington and financed by the United States," he said in to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, was granted.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Correa assured that he does not regret that decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He added that it "was at the time, that Assange extradited to a third country and would not be complied with procedures."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which requires him to an interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence, while the Swedish law "allowed through a video conference on its territory the Embassy of Ecuador in London could have been carried out."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Correa said that there was a risk that would affect the health and mental state of Assange.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"He is in our message that I have not spoken with him, the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the Head of Ecuador.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
There is a danger, though, that he would be physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a tight space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"That would affect the health of all people," he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted since the month of June in the Ecuador Embassy in London, is the granting of a free letter, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that it is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe's lies. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution to the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
We do not act with human rights, that we do not apply in this case, however, there were ongoing talks.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because Assange's lawyer, Sanguineti Tsar Garzón, a series of procedures at various European forums," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
And "when Britain granted morning this, in my opinion, this is done."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
And if Mr Assange to Sweden interrogated on the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype, as allowed under Swedish law and in other cases, be resolved the problem.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie that infringe the freedom of expression."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador more dominated by such journalists "and not by bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries," and I think he took a re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism "must stand firm and no opportunism and no grieving as a legal coup d," because it "was destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The President of Ecuador is also the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the verdict of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which places the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua to negotiate with the seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, is "absolutely right."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Currently, this judgment is not being implemented.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
It is a problem between the South and Central American state.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
They must be fully addressed, so that they can overcome and look forward.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Similarly, he said to a successful conclusion of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court that "it is right to go to international bodies for Latin America, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
With regard to the possibility that he presents himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to reach his third consecutive mandate, he admitted that he "sees this opportunity with optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Correa assured that if he would lose the elections in February 2013 that he would retire from political life.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Has never interested me personally, but in doing so unjust circumstances such as these socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by the political power.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"My political movement, I had the belief that it was, which guaranteed the likely victory, so I must assume this responsibility," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
If I were to win, it would be my last term as President, I retreat from public life.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
This also applies when we lose.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"It is decided," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
I just finished with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had been planned for a routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
"It in no way means a return to the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.

The cause of a death due to AIDS is now too late detection
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the outcome of the inquiry: HIV positive.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success "tried to weaken."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He hid it from his family.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He decided to devote himself to his disease and started to inform themselves about, and this with such commitment, that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 22 years, at the beginning of the 90 s was hard to see as many doubts, there were few treatment options and more Stigmata.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
At that time, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
AIDS was synonymous with death.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
However, there are still many people in the clinic, who know none of their disease and the virus already has caused damage and has exhausted her immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, the first reported cases, "the great success today that the survival of a patient who undergoes treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG diet, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information had been based in April this year from a respected scientific publication.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The an expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists have that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that was the years of survival and quality of life by the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that would give greater opportunities that are not addicts: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years for on a count of 500 CD4.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Simply put, the above that, at the age of 25 years who gets diagnosed HIV positive, in that sense "can easily be 75 years old, as long as he is under control," he said the expert.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
In order to evaluate this progress right must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today, an average of 76 years.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS, from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) affecs), it is nevertheless true that have died since the advent of AIDS in 60 percent of patients covered in the national database.

- Why are still dying people?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
- In my opinion, is not the problem of access to treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
At least in the last 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of drugs. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their infectious condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnosis is necessary, and all the people, where necessary, must be offered screening tests on a massive scale."

This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo de plans del Sida en Jalisco (Coe Ida) (state committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and the patient as Fabrizio, who his test at a private laboratory had called, and it was only because a friend had made by him, despite his young age already in the AIDS era was, and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.

Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.

Some think that they will die, and we do not want to hear.

In the specific places "was actually increased the distribution of condoms; previously they were made separately, now they give us packages with one hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to an a condom," he said.

"Why do you need?" Is a widespread derision question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, which does not want to expose young people, the correspondent said.

He proposed to move this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequented by young people.
</seg>

It should not be promoted promiscuity.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life '

<p>
<seg id="2">
The globetrotter contrast, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was linked to the basket more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of the history of the country in May as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, was Rexes part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player and manager in the lower classes, players of the first national league, BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"My whole life I have drafted me in basketball many hats, including several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the Association in the 90 s," recalled Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora, at his home in Bayamón, where he with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years, lives.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Basketball was my life."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Reyes not exaggerating with this statement.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Almost all the walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Bayamón in the heart
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The stirs memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50 s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary and has been further or directors of the club.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
"These were my best years I have enjoyed most, because I was to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a managing director, has been further or coach.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There were many play successive years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of debuts by Jerome Mincy BSN.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Then, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "says Reyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
I know that genes bar, as a trainer worked here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was employed, said: "I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Do you want? "
</seg>
<seg id="17">
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players ever, Puerto Rico.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Then recommended to the free throw Raymond Gausse specialists and was one of our best shooter.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I remember, as he said that if possible Mincy had a championship for Bayamon, would make Gausse for another.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The championship of the vaqueros with Gausse was granted him, but even from a distance, because he was already 1988 at the top of the class.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
At the time, he its application and to enjoy the Mincy in the national team.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we were the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if this Canadian referee, we would not have been the last move was repeated for the second time, said Reyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
This group was the 1990 World Cup the best national team, you have ever seen?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
It is one of the best, as well as those who won in the 2004 against the Dream Team.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
My favorite is the team of the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and the U.S. gave the team a fight, as when they won they were against us in the World Cup bronze.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be 1990 because of a knee injury.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but we won a gold medal and gave us great pleasure of the vorolympischen tournament was 1995 in the La Plata, Argentina.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, against all odds we won the gold medal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
And this, without taking account of his career in the different leagues, in which he has played.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
This is a difficult question.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
We had a number of good coach like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Arman Dito Torres.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Of the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
What do you think is the best that you have achieved in the association?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 90 years he up to 17 teams in a season.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
What can you do?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and meet in the national playoffs teams from other corners of the island.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Today, many children unnecessary trips and games.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
At least I can see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, officials and referees.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
I am proud of that.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
What are you doing today?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
I would like to listen to music, watch videos of music my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
