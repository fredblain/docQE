In the US strike Fast-Food- and Supermarkt-Besch채ftigte
Every fourth US at young people sitting behind the coffers of's
In the last few days there was in the US to massive protests against low wages in branches of popular restaurants and Walmart Fast-Food-Ketten as's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy 's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests still further swollen or whether they will soon be back to the air.
The protests are of trade unions and several left-wing voluntary organisations.
In addition to the increase of the modest wages of simple Walmart- and Fast-Food-Besch채ftigten pursue the objective of the organisers of the protests to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not organized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called black Friday, which took place in the US sales, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes Handgemengen.
To this day, some Walmart-Mitarbeiter, of which there are 2.2 million in the world, their work and bestreikten together with trade unions and leftist activist branches of the chain, which is targeted at people are low and middle-income.
All the products sold Walmart, of children's nappies on Jagdgewehre and Autobatterien to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart-Filialen is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the minor paid Walmart-Besch채ftigten buy only on their own workplace.
The prices and the Warensortiment Walmart made to one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics often Walmart, according to the product can only sell so favourable, because the staff are poorly paid.
The latter are complaining about serious conditions, for example, the lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner.
The participants of the protests on the 'black Friday' wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the betriebseigene health insurance from 30 to $100 per month has risen.
A typical Walmart-Mitarbeiter, the 9.5 of $an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company the average wage to 12 dollar the hour, it increased Walmart 3.2 billion dollars would cost.
These are approximately 1.1% more than they now for pay.
Would the wage increases Walmart fully pass on to the customers, every shopping in future it will only 46 cents more.
Per year would be for it, compared to today an additional cost of only 12,39 dollar.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it in only nine States to protests and that the company has caused any losses.
The black Friday took in its Laden from 8 p.m. on Thursday evening until midnight the next day, and in this period sold Walmart, approximately 5 000 articles per second.
As a whole, the Walmart-Kassen on the 'black Friday' almost 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the site of the left-wing Huffington post that as a whole 'less than five' Walmart-Mitarbeiter niederlegten the work and the action only 'another PR stunt' the trade union, the protests have been organised.
'Free' coffers.
The protests, this week in New York, where its aim, however, not Walmart-Filialen (which in this advanced city therefore not desirable, and are), but so far non-existent McDonald and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted not Krankentage, and you will not pay for your work honestly!

At present, the minimum wage in accordance with a federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollar the hour.
The minimum wage in Fast-Food-Restaurants will gradually increased, but not too much, and on average have their simple staff in New York USD 8,90 the hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible, in New York, with so little money, is beyond me.
It was a time, almost a quarter of all US young people after school at McDonald's behind the Theke was, however, the young people still living in their parents.
Hardly a saw in that the main source of income or planned to continue to remain there.
I now face in interviews with staff McDonald's constantly people who complain that they do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there are in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal, a comment, whose rapporteur points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if it did not know how they should feed.
The participants of the protests, on Thursday at 6.00 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began in demanding that the cashier and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants a minimum wage of USD 15 the hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They invited to the education of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche.
The US law prohibits the corporate governance, this objective to stand in the way and trade union members abzumahnen or dismissed.
On the other hand, the management of them is not easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche is difficult but also for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Discontented
Loud protests in this day there were also many other Fast-Food-Restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was an assembly the afternoon before the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including Stadtratsmitglied Jumaane Williams, who said: 'McDonald's, it says sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted not Krankentage, and you will not pay for your work honestly!'
The demonstrators were also of other prominent New York Democrats supports, for example, B체rgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that 'we should support the Fast-Food-Mitarbeiter together, so that they receive a fair wages and the economic prosperity, everyone can achieve the New York deserves!'.
According to the New York Times this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the US Fast-Food-Industrie.
However, were only a few hundred people on the ground, of which is far from all in the Fast-Food-Branche are employed in New York, in the tens of work.
It is not yet clear whether the spark will mobilise all of these protests masses.
