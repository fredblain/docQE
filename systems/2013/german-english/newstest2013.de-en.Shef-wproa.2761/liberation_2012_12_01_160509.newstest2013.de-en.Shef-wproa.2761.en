A constitution, with the way in Egypt
It is a new game of poker of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily the unlimited power granted to him, more than ever, remains divided, it decided to put everything on a card.
To the surprise of all, he has announced that on Wednesday, the Constituent Assembly on the next day will adopt its final version.
Just a week ago the head of state of this House had two more months to the conclusion of its work.
Egypt is now for almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and to a legal confusion.
This new initiative has only for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents remains the President in his' autocratic Delirium ', by breaking it continues to be' word 'and' the right underfoot '.
On the part of his supporters can assure you that it is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period, which obliges the Brothers, on their projects, the Egyptians the text section for section to explain.
For the President, it is also a way, its public and democratic legitimacy, during the protests throughout the country has been raging.
After the contrary, in an interview with the American Wochenschau Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote an ultimatum: 'Either agrees for my draft or I reserve the unlimited power', the latter should after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly an end.
85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals is not done so.
Just before the Constitutional Declaration in the middle of November they have averted, because they believe that they do not have been able to make their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities, or of civil society alike have acted.
To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning in a hurry 11 people, deputy Members.
Some are very close to the Moslembrüdern.
It is not surprising that the Article usually have been adopted unanimously.
The commentators have found it amusing that the only difference of the day... in the late hour for the prayer expressed, because some Members of the body of the opinion that the Constituent Assembly Pendeluhr not exactly was.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, is from 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew attention to all, finally, identical to that the 1971 constitution and says that 'the principles of the Sharia the main source of law'.
The Salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped, 'the principles' by the rules to replace ', which would have made a stronger application possible.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
'hypocrisy' say the Liberals, who only see this as Propagandaschlag.
Because, according to them is the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
They have in mind, particularly Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, particularly in relation to the review of the conformity with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier this is worrying as' the people who are asked to give an opinion, have not been elected and any democratic legitimacy.
It is this the first signs of a theocracy see '.
The fears of the Liberals will also be fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university much less than the current moderate should be.
'The is no specific religious commitment to see.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
The majority of lawyers who have worked on this text, but are not ulema, academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, "Alexis Blouet appeased a thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.
But he acknowledges that 'in relation to the Article 220 some ambiguity may be available, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It relates in particular, on the 'fiqh' [Islamic jurisprudence, Anm. that Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of to what extent Zivilrichter are competent to decide '.
In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday greatly because of the far-reaching powers, which he criticised the President of the Republic.
The Moslembrüder argue that these compared with the former regime are reduced.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In line with the desire of the military the examination of the defence budget will not be presented to Parliament, but a national NDC.
There will also no ban on civil in military courts, as the human rights associations have called for.
The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text with which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, and serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, there is no article refers more to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
Their opinion, is the only positive point the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President yesterday evening on the television demonstrations had to speak, are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will March Saturday.
