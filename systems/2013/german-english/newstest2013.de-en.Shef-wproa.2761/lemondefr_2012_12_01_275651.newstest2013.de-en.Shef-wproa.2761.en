'PSG is not the Barcelona!'
In this season PSG have you with a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
It cannot by a personal view, but also by the new dimension of the PSG explain.
Great players are.
Every day, I am making progress on their side.
The technical staff has also given a lot to me.
These elements spur me to my Spielniveau on a daily basis, to improve.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football is all very quickly.
But I do not breche in enthusiasm.
Since my origins in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my Spielzeit in gradually Saint-Etienne I have always made progress.
They are thus the advantage of by Carlo Ancelotti competition introduced...
The new entrants of this summer are accustomed, Games very high level.
They also know that any Trainingseinheit is crucial.
This means that a player, as I have to stand up to and want to give its best.
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti much in relation to my Spielposition.
It will be supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele, on the same position as I was.
Ancelotti is the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills all the technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and it is the best coaches of Europe.
He has a rich experience and has many title with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with major players.
I think that it will gain further title in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging talk with him.
At that time, I have just recovered from a Verletzungsserie.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation of my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 has Lyon Spitzenreiters the place of us.
But we lurk in ambush.
One of our most important objectives is the Champions League: we have in this way to the final 8 qualified.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try, as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
We will, however, against a very good European teams have our say.
Firstly, we want first of our group in Porto, so that we return leg of the Achtelfinales out as does best.
Can the PSG in the short term, a great European club?
He has already the budget for...
In order to be a great European club, Paris title must win a name and long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially is the PSG the funds, so that this project takes concrete forms.
It would be a great failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to gain, as in the last season was the case?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really to cream off this title.
In the last season, we were close off.
In May, we were disappointed, because we have been strong enough to the victory.
We have the season with a very strong performance closed.
We have concluded with 79 points.
We should normally be master with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right.
Even if the big teams like Marseilles, Lyon or Bordeaux the title, I believe that we have the stuff to him to win.
Do you think that the media to expect much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players, we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept the perfect.
However, if we in a does best against Troyes 4-0 gain, and we still find something to what we can accuse us of this is certainly somewhat frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win with 4-0 every weekend.
We are not of the Barcelona!
We are trying to establish a Spielkonzept.
Building a team with the time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, not to qualify for the final 8, and which also has huge expenditure.
In view of the sums invested believed you to time out with 15 points ahead!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, the last season were not well, this new PSG 'geboostet'.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we in the month of May the smiling will be winners and tell us that we finally, despite all the difficulties they have won.
The PSG seems completely from the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be dependent on.
In order better to be a 'Zlatan-Abh√§ngigkeit'.
This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and many goals.
That is why it is, and it shows that he is the star the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that it is a great players and a world star with respect.
Within the team, we respect both the players and the person.
He also respected the people who surround him.
What he has done, is exceptional.
This encourages others, to improve their Spielniveau.
Thiago Silva, the world is one of the best defenders, it allows all others also to make progress.
As you have the Euro 2012 seen with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in the Euro.
Unfortunately, my violation prevented from something obscene Spielzeit.
I have seen things there emerged strengthened from which I am.
Today, I am, good Games in the national team.
This was since my baptism with the 'Bleus' my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learnt our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views to the first few months by Didier Deschamps at the top of the 'Bleus'?
He has promising results achieved.
We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.
The coaches is strictly, is close to the players and encourages the victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to no comparison.
Blanc had achieved its objective, by giving us for Euro qualified.
I hope that the 'Bleus Didier Deschamps' to Brazil.
Is that on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1: 1) a Auftaktspiel?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has for all the other.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never been a comparable game in my career.
