'The large and powerful' leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While Members and civil rights activist discuss what benefit the law on binding language tests for immigrants, criminals already act with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Russia and other cities.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is, money for the maintenance of the remaining families in the home to deserve.
On 1 December, a law in force, according to which everyone working immigrant a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, must.
Until now, this regulation only for migrants, which in the service sector, in the local housing and retail want to work.
The tests should, however, with the time Föderaler Migrationsbehörde in the future for all migrant workers to be compulsory.
In this regard, we must not only language tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language proficiency must both for the conservation and the extension of the work permit be demonstrated.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is an official language.
Also of this law, the people are excluded from their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the break-up of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, the problem and protection of human rights
The whole of the Prüfungsstellen, under the aegis of the Puschkin-Instituts for the Russian language, the Russian University of the friendship among peoples, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can the tests in all the cities to have already been in Russia; more than 160 appropriate centres.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was of the Members of the State Duma and Federal Migrationsbehörde support.
Civil rights activist, however, before the entry into force of the law on several occasions in the press the following question: what will the whole thing?
What changes does the rule, language skills to have to show, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, however, the spokesman Migrationsbehörde is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.
'For many now talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers,' says the head of the representation of the Federal Migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights must, however, already before departure be protected.
Only an organised recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Confronted with problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without necessarily people with evil intentions of languages, which will tackle it under the pretext of aid in the dark, close shack, where he with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents persevere and 12 to 14 hours a day will exists.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
'In the country will give you the A promised, and the arrival of you will be deceived, have their passports and do not receive the promised pay', confirms the head of the headquarters for migration, the Tajik Migrationsbehörde Tolib Schwaripow.
Not complaining head!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who earn their money, not just that they do not speak the language of the country of destination, but also in their own language hardly in writing to express themselves.
Of course, this is not their fault, but the evil: only a few Turkmens and Tajiks, Uzbeks, too, can only sensible primary education.
Because in their families there is not yet even money to the children to feed them, let alone, proper clothing, footwear and Schulsachen to buy.
These children as a teenager then immediately take the first opportunity for making money.
'It is difficult without knowledge', to give them.
"You fühlst you humiliated and inferior. '
Civil rights activist stress on the following important aspect of the law.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, there are no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
'Herzlich welcome' or 'Entry prohibited' for unauthorised
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy, in Russia, an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
It also costs the legalisation of money: 12 to 16 thousand ruble.
A counterfeit registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents largely fabricated and we are not registered, and it then cases of blackmail.
'you are one or two hundred ruble for cigarettes and tea', is the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
'merely no cost for false papers shy'
Already on the day on which the law came into force, it emerged that not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates, which the completion of the language tests, have already been of staff of the Federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.
The counterfeit documents were printed with an ordinary Farbdrucker.
Naturally, the new owner this not in vain: every migrant who hoped that this will be able to save the tests, paid for the document thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the costs for the official test: this costs a migrant workers three thousand ruble.
The fact that the most immediate task is, the system to protect against corruption, so that the certificates not simply can be bought, are both officials and civil rights activist agree.
For the moment, the public authorities can immigrant workers, the first time by the test, only promise that it is time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
Furthermore, new arrivals without language skills offered jobs in areas where there is no active understanding with people is necessary.
