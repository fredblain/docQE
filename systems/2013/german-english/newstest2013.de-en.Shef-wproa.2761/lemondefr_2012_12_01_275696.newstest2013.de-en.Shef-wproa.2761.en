With Bitcoin is possible without paying and selling Bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and administrative fees between the parties involved.
Furthermore, as so often in these technologies to reach a political vision: the conviction that the current Bankmonopolen structured monetary system, to financial crises.
That is indeed of Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) trumped-up Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in the dollar, euro, etc., convertible) and a protocol for the safe exchange as BitTorrent, the direct exchange of files.
With 15 000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions.
A few thousand Web sites Bitcoin accept as donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 a high of $30 (23 euro), five months later he fell to $2 today, before he has recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison with the world trade from real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown for this.
It describes Bitcoin as' the virtual currency with the greatest success', 'in competition with the dollar or the euro' and 'similar to the conventional currencies'.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the 'bill' that will be used to make progress in a video game that we gain by Games, or buy (and sometimes zurücktauschen).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
Every time, however, the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin are all Netzknoten Rechnungsbuchs repositories of the same time, Auditors, Geld-Emittenten and buyers and sellers.
So what does this network?
Each transaction between two users will take place in reality, between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.
With the difference that the user to pay for any other, can choose what the anonymity.
A number of this operation in connection with the data will be signed electronically by a double cypher system.
In this way can the network of the authenticity of the transaction.
By means of the content of the database, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the whole network widespread Rechnungsbuch of public accounts are there.
The decisive step is that this new transaction in this book.
This is happening on a mathematical task, which will be launched on computers, with the winners, a kind of preliminary Zentralbankier, has the privilege, this additional line to add.
It is a Zerstückeln the file, i.e. transforming a major file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprinting.
The computer 'take' the new transaction and do it in a number, before the whole 'zerhackt'.
The aim is, the number to find a special fingerprint (many zeros) at the beginning.
If this figure has been found, the other knot can easily examine whether it is the right one.
The transaction is in the long term with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprints.
If a user to cheat two time very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay, would only one of the two transactions to be validated by the network and the other if there is no link, as both different fingerprints.
The computer, the task has been resolved, 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will reward this regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, what a certain room for manoeuvre...
Moreover, the difficulty of the task with any improvement of Rechenleistung increased.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The website, the services for Bitcoin, have been attacked and the Bitcoin-Einlagen stolen.
'The used weakness is not the real Minutes', Pierre Noizat just Paymium has introduced a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
Cash also, however, these shortcomings.
Wikipedia major players, such as refuse to donations of this kind.
Others, such as the Blog-Plattform WordPress they will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir, and in Israel by Ron Dorit Weizmann-Institut the Rechnungsbuch analysed and shown that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November has been launched a 'Mega-Schlussverkauf'.
Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged 'welcomes', Jon Holmquist, for the company is working Coinabul Bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat also, the author of a book on this currency is, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk.
Paytunia be system is a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone use but Bitcoin for the Validation of transactions, it is cheaper.
Moreover, the holder managed its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented in the traders, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
They simply need to give an address by a telephone 'and' recognised can be photographed, Pierre Noizat, the assurances that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend, in the hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems designed to be reviewed.
'It will be some time before Bitcoin 2013, but could be a turning point, "he predicted.
The ECB is in her report, moreover, the various, today as a highly prestigious risks in the event of a success of this currency.
