My mexikanisch-amerikanische identity crisis.
Many people are given the lack of opportunities, Mexico forced to leave
Mexicans, the immigrants tend to blame - they call them in difficult times, he says
Navarrette is the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just the hall running and was reached in the passport, as a dilemma in me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for 'Mexicanos' ('Mexicans'), the other for 'Extranjeros' ('foreigners').
I was there a few seconds, uncertain, to which I should like to go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien has been raised and all my life 'Mexicans'.
An ethnic acronym - just as my friends in Boston 'Irish' or my friends in New York "Italians'.
Later, I opted for 'Mexikanisch-Amerikanisch'.
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's there was no need for acronyms or hyphenation.
I was simply Americans.
I am speaking Spanish, at least well enough to me in this language at both ends of interviews to say.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American emphasis I will also not happening.
Therefore, I took my American passport and asked me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought this week on the moment when the future President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House, in order to meet President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues which we expect, if the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that Mexicans today, with just as likely to remain in Mexico, rather than emigrating to the United States.
He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and a North American trading bloc for example of the European Union.
And he swore Pena Nieto Mexico, the war against the drug cartels to continue, even if he no details.
Mexico ’ s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans have probably never waste a single idea that the United States in 1848 invaded in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem rifle forced them to more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans in centuries, and not in Minutes think, are memories of this event not to overlook.
Therefore, once a US-Regierungsbeamter only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - of complaints, as the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children Montezumas is leaving for the war-path.
And yet is the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
The inclination, resentment to speak?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio live, is that on a point in our family tree of a person - perhaps a parents' associations or Großelternteil - no chance in Mexico needed, and towards North immigrated.
And in most cases this person was a profile - brown-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the offspring of these people, and our allegiance to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we now live perhaps the American dream, good schools have visited and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many Members of the Mexican ruling class may not.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument a humiliating defeat and look to us, because we are not mexikanisch enough.
Our Spanish will never good enough, our relations with Mexico never be strong enough.
Their opinion, is a symbol of the failure of our existence.
If not our families in Mexico, they would not have failed.
And then we would not now caught behind the Seidenvorhang see - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child einwanderte legally in the United States, I am reminded that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take it for them.
While it is American citizen, it feels as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican bond Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen song come.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we will be seen as the Americans.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: some of the Mexican leaders and parts of the Bildungsbürgertums wish to resume their links to the diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans as a provisional 'ambassador' for Mexico, their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues of them as to how great a visit this country is, and pressure on the political leadership, to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of incomes, the rampant corruption and the Drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I fear that, alone with their cronies.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans not yet ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico and a half centuries, they must also accept that some of the Mexican Americans have a resentment for their family members, as only not so long ago have been treated.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are 'Mexican', as I thought.
