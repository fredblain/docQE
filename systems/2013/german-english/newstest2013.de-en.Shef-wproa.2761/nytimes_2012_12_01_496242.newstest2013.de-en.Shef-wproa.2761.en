In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is good, also to be bored
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours in the airport, as our aircraft operated by mechanical problems and we have had to wait another aviators.
I therefore had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not lie.
Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait, is quite nervtötend - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, steuerfreies shopping) are available.
But still more academics and boredom Kindesentwicklungsexperten lead as something positive.
If they are concerned, it is for us - and our children - well, sometimes to be bored.
This is the brain, be forced to lose in interesting line of reasoning, which may the creativity.
And because the majority of us today, almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, are the benefits of boredom not more.
The boredom we should therefore welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back again.
How many people also, I am always assumed that boredom a relatively recent phenomenon that is with growing leisure has developed.
But, Mr Peter Toohey, Professor for Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of 'Boredom: a Lively History' (Yale University Press 2011), it is not so.
'In fact the boredom a very long history', he says.
The Hauswände Pompejis ziert a Latin graffiti on boredom, on the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood associated, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that, defined and boredom in many ways been discussed.
After long reading Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of almost 100 people were Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, 'a satisfactory activity, but that does not want to be able to define'.
Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person concerned is not, however, this would like to be.
At the apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.
The Schlüsselerfahrung the boredom, he says, in a "disturbance of Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time only slowly passes'.
Thus boredom can almost as to listen to such as depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions are bored people could see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that we have is dull, even if we merely difficulties, we have to focus.
In its study 'The Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention - German, for example:' The inert minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention ', which in September in the journal' Perspectives on psychological Science 'appeared, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment with the participants a bond listen to which a person a Magazinartikel read.
Some groups have heard a resounding channel from the neighbouring area, which nothing to do with the content. Others had heard it at the lower volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group these noises not heard.
Those who gave barely recognisable television echoes of boredom, more than the other two groups - to feel they have had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If an attempt at a difficult or arduous task, the disruption to focus attention on boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated Professor for neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you a dreary work - 'as the search for defective products on a Fabrikförderband can distract, music and help, not to feel bored'.
Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even combat by people can remain physically more attentively.
'studies have shown that children who herumhampeln, must learn more and more information than those who keep stillsitzen be forced to', as Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender, loudspeakers particularly ermüdender film.
But some people bore more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, advanced researchers in the 1980 ’ s a 'scale to Langeweileanfälligkeit'.
On the scale are statements such as' For many things that I have to do and are repeating monotonously 'and' I have many interests, that I do not have enough time for all '.
Through these scales, researchers found that more girls than boys boring, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, what the need for more and a greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general are teenagers a fairly abgespannter bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager kontaktierte.
He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and to do the homework were bored, whereas 23% said that to be bored, if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents gave, bored.
Professor Larson say today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increase or decrease.
He was sure, however, that 'the young people is seen as particularly boring, mainly because children and teenagers no great influence on their Alltagsablauf.
Back then to my Ursprungsfrage: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it brings people extreme physical risks and the gambling or drugs, in order to alleviate them - the studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors of the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, the issue for more than two decades.
'With the boredom wants the brain a say that we should do something else, Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not know what it is always the best should do.
If a boring and these energy is used to play and Gitarre to cook, will be happy.
But in the short term for Glücksgefühle television can ensure that these fizzle but again in the long term.
His bored child who is therefore an iPad, can be diverted from boredom. It has not learned however, in order to maintain or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: 'self-regulation is transferred from a situation on the other'.
The baby learns not only to maintain, but is also in other areas more self-regulation.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also see it not be too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to us and outside of the permanent Aktivitäts- Technologieberieselung at ease.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
'It is so often, as we should be boring. But boredom, the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful', he says.
He believes that the people in reality only after a way forward, and less so.
'In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to deal with it, even if the noise is dead.'
