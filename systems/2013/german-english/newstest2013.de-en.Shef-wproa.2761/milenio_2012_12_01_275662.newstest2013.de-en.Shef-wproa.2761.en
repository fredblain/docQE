The cause of a death because AIDS is today a late diagnosis
Mr Fabrizio was 21 years old, when he was confirmed the outcome: HIV-positive.
'It was as if a bomb hit', he says about the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible sign of success' tried to '.
He hidden it before his family.
He decided to itself to his illness and has begun to take care to be informed; and this with such commitment that he has just celebrated its 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV-Einheit of the hospital patients of the Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after many struggles in 1994.
Mr Fabrizio live with the humane Immundefizienz-Virus (HIV) for 22 years, which initially of the 1990s, as it was difficult to imagine many doubts, few treatment and more stigmas.
At that time avoiding even the director of a clinic of IMSS to adopt, because 'it in a dead end.'
At that time was synonymous with AIDS death.
Today, it is possible, this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.
However, still many people in the hospital, who know nothing of their illness and in which the virus has already damage and their immune system has exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases' means of the great success today that the survival of the treatment of patients, in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same ', said the head of the HCG HIV-Einheit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information in April this year by a reputable scientific publication has been based.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the year 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence is that, but the years of the survival and the quality of life by the degree of prejudice to the immune system of the people at the beginning of the treatment, and that those who depended have greater opportunities, which are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a sort of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a sort of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above, mean that anyone in the age of 25 years the diagnosis are HIV-positive, in this sense, "can be easily 75 years old, as long as he is under control ', said this expert.
In order to correct this progress must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today, on average, 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS by 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in the year 2011 (annual ONUSIDA)), it is nevertheless true that since the appearance of the AIDS 60% of the national database that patients have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until the month of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, rest assured that it, since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral medicines.
- Why are therefore still people?
- In my opinion, is not the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years ago we had no problems in the case of medicines. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their Infektionszustand, i.e. in a very late stages of the disease.
He makes a resounding statement: 'Nine of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection in order to be able to influence global mortality two diagnoses are needed, which is why all people, where necessary, must be offered screening tests'.
This proposal are the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state Committee to AIDS-Vermeidung in Jalisco) and the patients as Mr Fabrizio to its test in a private laboratory has carried out, and this for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite its young age was already in the AIDS-Phase and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything has changed, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and would like to hear anything.
'If I have to die, then we would rather burst' three times, we say in my case.
The amendment was to towards improvement, I am that drives ernähre, sport and take note of the medicines.
His parents know today that he had only cancer.
I live a normal life, as everyone else.
'I am much, I have an active, but good sex lives, I respect to my health and the other person', is Mr Fabrizio to the agreed to his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco, in order to share with his testimony to encourage those who, today in the framework of global AIDS-Tages fear.
They should make the test, if they are vulnerable. The sooner they know whether they are positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live as all the people responsible.
Its news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens, there are great holes, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV has adopted.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In this specific places', the distribution of condoms actually increased; previously they were issued individually, now give us packages with a hundred piece of what is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom ', he said.
To the Risikopersonen for new infections include the young people.
'What need you?' is a widespread Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal in schools, social workers, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, the young people are not want to suspend, assured the correspondent.
He suggested that these inefficient distribution of condoms to orient; the new should not only behind the counter, but in Ausgabegeräten in public toilets of institutions, often of young people.
It is not the promiscuity be encouraged.
They are not the beer and Motel be paid, as the governor Emilio González on the question of whether, under his administration condoms would be distributed.
'sexuality is not enough; it is the best use of condoms, to bring it closer to those already in a sexual activity', he brought it to the point.
Of key dates of Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is seen at national level to 4 point of new and cumulative AIDS, and 13 point in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection will remain forever be on sex, 6% of the blood and perinatal 2%.
It is estimated that, 50 000 people living with HIV, because it is for each registered 4 or 5, there are people who do not know.
