Birth in outer space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with Killerasteroid.
By guiding caravans from spacecraft with Erdbewohnern on board, on the search for a Ersatzplaneten.
In order to save humanity in the, is the important issue, as we are in or on the Ersatzplaneten breed?
Many choice I believe that there are not.
De facto there are only two real planet, we could at least the hypothetical inhabit.
'namely Mars and Venus,' says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg-Instituts Vladimir Surdin.
But, while the conditions on Mars comparatively build enjoyable, there is on the surface of the Venus, a temperature of 500 level.
Life would be only in a great height or in orbit Venus, therefore, possible in space.
The question of reproduction in the first of all researchers in terms of the flora.
Already half a century before that have been carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation in orbit bred peas differed not in any of the abasing worldly species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, in fact by tiny fruit (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 Wachteleier have been sent out into space, in order to explore how the zero gravity on the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chicks.
But it is then the problem.
'The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it must be on its feet and start to move', explained the laboratory officials of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische slice, Vladimir Sychew problems.
Without firm underground, the chickens have been falling over themselves in the wild.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn completely.
The chicks not reacting to light and Laute.
Four days later they will then simply died.
We were chicks slip 'twice and the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them', Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chickens in space.
Brutkäfig the last 16 years ago with animals flew into orbit.
In the spring 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, on the Biosatelliten Bion 'only' same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats fertilized into space, which has already been sent.
In principle was nothing special.
'That was precisely with the Biosatelliten, but once again, it was only a single experiment, and the research should be continued,', says Vladimir Sychew.
After landing received the Weltraumratten offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space, it has not yet been resolved.
The task is difficult.
Animals from their natural habitats, can simply be taken out their Fortpflanzungstrieb not follow.
In contrast to the animals could the person in principle.
Homo sapiens is able to abstraktem thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations are not such experiments carried out.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk, there were in Tereshkova.
The Wertvollste that mankind is of the female body.
Our Möwe flew of them, and no one on earth can answer the following question: would it survives the Weltraumflug?
Will it, after this flight bring a child into the world?
Nobody 'Finally answered this question,' says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June in 1964, only a year after their Weltraumflug, gave the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a subsidiary.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also militiamen.
In 1988 brought forth the second women in the space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which twice in orbit was, and even work outside the Raumfahrzeugs leisure, a son.
Nevertheless, there is a risk.
We have only very few a cosmonaut, after long flights everything went well and they were healthy offspring.
'The more, the more dangerous, it is even on flights into orbit', concludes militiamen Valeryi Poljakow, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, the human race for new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the produce of artificial Gravitation.
In the Hydrolabor Vorbereitungszentrum the cosmonaut is a compulsory station during the ground.
Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
The water, the zero gravity.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a strange surroundings; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony to that of the lives of the Ocean turning to the country.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the stomach of the mother Fruchtwasser, and that it easier to get used to water.
In principle is the logical, as after birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
'It is too little time to forget,' says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the zero gravity is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of the zero gravity is the enormous Beckenmuskulatur Bauch- and quickly, and this is also the ability to extract the child.
Well, we deal by geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could, for example, in a Spezialkammer, in order to extract the child.
'But what happens then?', is the not insignificant question by Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand, also needs the child artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung to feel, can the organism the skeleton and muscles not train.
A newborn child can in orbit not as an adult for training in a Belastungsanzug.
It is simply the lack of his life, which is of fundamental importance.
'This experiment, which together, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will mean that we have a disabled people, a completely unangepassten will bring to the world,' says the head of the problems of the Institute for Bioethikkommission medizinisch-biologische slice, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in outer space mere hypothesis.
But they will eventually become reality if the people in their spacecraft to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space.
