Butter drink - every day and age of 168
Many people in the south of Azerbaijan achieve a biblisch high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A Spurensuche in the country in which 97-Jährige are still relatively young.
Many people in the south of Azerbaijan achieve a biblisch high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A Spurensuche in the country in which 97-Jährige are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch-Gebirge is wildromantisch.
The Kleinbus rumpelt kurvenreiche on the street, densely forested hills, rivers and simple Bauernhäusern reißenden.
Everything is green and stiff, one might think that it is in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres.
Here, the Caucasian the Talyschen that not much is aware, except that they perfect Persian and Aserisch speaks and very long-lived.
Final destination is Lerik.
The small city flaunts to greedy wuchtig architecture of Soviet times, which are not in the picturesque Berglandschaft to fit.
Tourists come from Europe, here too onerous is hardly the capital of Azerbaijan Baku.
We need for the 323 kilometres of eight hours, because the road is only one-sided.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is here in the province of not yet arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that the stuff Lerik to tourist attraction.
'Baku was in May with the famous Eurovision-Song-Festival - and in the next year we have here a festival of the oldest people of the world', says Fatulayeva.
It is the Director of the Museum of longevity, is the only in the world.
This is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, the older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a Schwarz-Weiß-Foto.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years a child born
But more controversial Star the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, 168 years old.
However, there is not a ’ s birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented people, 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but extremely dubious.
'1805 when he was born here in the region, in 1973, he died' Fatulayeva explained.
The man is three times have been married and have 23 children, in the age of 136 years he should have created a daughter.
So has Şirali Müslümov in his age in order to build a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, on Max-Planck-Institut Altersforscher in Rostock, has from the very elderly in Central Asia.
'striking many hochaltrige people, there is also in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza-Tal in Pakistan,' says Scholz, 'also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men'.
However, due to lack of documentation is no scientific evidence on the age, given register.
Every day becherweise geschmolzene butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik a remarkably often biblisches age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why are so many hochbetagte here in the South?
The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the with the special genes Talyschen.
Museumsdirektorin Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is in the diet.
But that it should be the kalorienreiche Talyschen as healthy diet of the meat, bread and milk products, above all love and many of which daily geschmolzene butter drink a glass, seems from a nutritional point of view it is not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people? in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city, Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With their 97 years, it is for these regions still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims, 143 descendants have to live in a simple Holzhaus, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground with a Butterfass they relentlessly herrollt back and forth.
Eight people live under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two small children around jump.
In the kitchen is preparing the guests tea, in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu-Gläsern.
Mirzayevas White teeth are in perfect Reih and link, under its headscarf dunkelblonde Zöpfe long, they hide their son proud before us reveals.
I have my hair always with milk laundered, and I never kept their colour.
'shampoo I have never used,' says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
It has always only the ate what of their own Court came, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I do not have a single time in the supermarket food bought.
Then they are told by her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was it in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the 'beloved father' Heydar Aliyew took power.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouths of an old woman.
But the cult of the father figure of the nation is being driven his country as a dictator, knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, later took his son, Ilham the helm.
After all, there is no need of Azerbaijan ’ s elderly.
230 Manat (approximately the same amount in euro per month), receives Mirzayeva as pensions, for here an amount which we live.
And perhaps also has long been Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: 'The Old enjoy in our culture of respect'.
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved to be invested and are happy.
If this is not a reason, as long as possible to stay alive
