Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the test should be made or not?
The PSA-Test, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, but also with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation the already undecided men for the implementation of Früherkennungstests.
The test should be made or not?
We have sought the opinion of two consultant.
In the studies conducted in the United States were many disruptors between the control, so that it is difficult to interpret these data and clear recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that, when Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of the likelihood of the education of metastases 30 to 40% higher, if no screening has been carried out.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, when one has a direct relatives to prostate cancer, which was already ill.
In men afro-amerikanischer origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to take the right decision, as soon as a cancer was recognised.
There are cancers, the aggressive and others, the indolent.
The patient must the scale of the risk of its cancer really understandable, be made by him the possible options, which remain untouched Prostatakrebse can, if he the quality of life in the long term, and it is not affected in these cases for a more active monitoring of the disease.
Today, will take place in many men, in which it has not recognised, cancer treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and not a threat to their lives.
It proposes them an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
We certainly with greater accuracy the criteria for a decision, who should be dealt with and who does not.
I therefore recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.
The most important, but it is to speak with his doctor in order to determine whether it should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international society for Urologie Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible, the advantages and disadvantages of the widespread PSA testing.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle the best way, in order to reduce the risk, to him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all good enough to eat and would move.
'If there is no smokers more, this value at least 50% increase, "stresses André Beaulieu, the spokesperson of the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft.
However, is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unresolved.
For the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of people.
'Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers' regrets the spokesman of André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity-related health issues also promote the outbreak of disease.
They seem the risk for breast, Grimmdarm-, Mastdarm- Speiseröhren- Bauchspeicheldrüsen-, to increase, and cervical cancer.
'The research shows that a regular physical activity during the whole life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects', he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends, the consumption of red meat.
In too great deal, it increases the risk of a Grimm- or Mastdarmkrebs to become ill.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat civilization once lived quite hygienically by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the education of carcinogens.
'the latter can damage the cells and the development of cancer, "he says.
Vitamins
In recent years have a number of scientists the connection between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer.
But their studies are currently not conclusive.
The Canadian Krebsgesellschaft are the studies to vitamin E contradictory.
While a study which reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, showed a different rather an increase.
The effect of Vitamin D on the cancer has also not yet made quite clear.
Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is, with his doctor of its concerns and his family down to speak.
'The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer'.
