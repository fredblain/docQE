After the Court of Appeal of the United States a judgment has confirmed that the restructuring of the liabilities of the group vitro fertilization, which does not recognise a Handelskonkurs in Mexico has been achieved is a pernicious precedent for every national companies with establishments in the neighbouring country, which has created Zahlungsprobleme.
One could say that the procedures for the survival of businesses that the Mexican laws allow in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale on court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas, that the Mexican businesses the seizure of property across the river bravo helpless are exposed.
However, the largest Glashersteller decision opens the door in Mexico, for three inconsistencies the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
During the judges of the matter to point out that the creditors the Bankruptcy must be subject to the United States says that the Court of Appeal of the Fifth circuit, based in New Orleans, firstly, that the main proceedings Handelskonkurs dealt with the in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures in default by companies which are of trans-national profile is not known.
Indeed, to this end the Modellgesetz of the United Nations for the unification of the international commercial law, with the American Law Institute was used as an arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment that, without the voices of the societies after recognition of the liabilities in the liquidation of the branches of vitro, with its parent company had not the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities been achieved.
But this is the possibility of the Mexican laws recognised.
In vitro fertilization is not the first case in which this scheme has been permitted.
There is a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities of the group of companies by the Istituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Handelskonkurse) confirmed.
Right is also that, after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches the creditors of vitro the creditors in the courts of the United States against vitro cases, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited no majority have reached.
The vote would be 45% against 37%.
This will not take into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there are vitro blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the framework of the major economic crisis in the United States, which hits the country.
For this reason, the family González Sada before the same Court of Appeal contradiction to the vote in plenary, i.e. all judges, because only three of them were voting on.
It is not granted the Cerciorare-Einspruch will, of the review of the procedure by calling for a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The Schwerwiegende in this case is a document that the Court has set aside by the Mexican Government amicus curiae under the figura (friend of the Court) was sent by vitro, what the procedure in the framework of the law on Handelskonkurse, and what is pointed out that it is strictly to the agreements signed by both countries had kept to the chapter on 15 of Chapter XI bankruptcy procedures of the United States.
It is also pointed out that the country to the principles of the United Nations Commission on the subject to international trade, namely the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border default, the equality of debtors and creditors.
