The MVRDV architects prove that the real spirit of adventure are - not only in mind the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created Bücherberg - 2 photographs
'I think the buildings, it is much futuristic, and finally, there is something interesting to see', says Lisette Verhaig, a roadside Passantin.
Stefan Spermon IT technicians and, in a nearby corporate sector, says: 'But, nice it is already the House'.
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All the Internet, and E-Books iPad.
No one is still in a this Old-Style-Bibliotheken voluntarily, or?
Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt at the gates Rotterdams is strange record holder.
The 80.000-Einwohner-Gemeinde, the lowest Bildungsrate the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid fact, it was decided a few years, to education and the seven fictitious bridges, on the Euroscheinen, as depicted beautiful bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the pool in borders.
And so did the Stadtväter that the only way, the statistics Mr: a library must ago.
Winy Maas by the Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV, master the foolhardy Balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen, and often, cynical buildings, the matter with his usual calmness and, in 2003 with five books Wettbewerbs-Hearing the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury is still intrigued to, and with the 'Transparent zuckte, stapelte the impudent Maas his splendid Mitbringsel to the size of a pyramid and ended his aktionistisch well-founded speech with the words:' My Stadtgemeinde! '
It is, therefore, my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive Berg aufgeschüttet.
It is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts, to the underground car park, supermarket, postal services and a few neighbouring housing and tear with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg with the second price 'Best Library of NL 2012' excellent.
Moreover, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award for 2012.
That is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte which, hitherto, has not had to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly town hall, behind its white facades it would be inclined to suggest a Molkereifabrik a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkenisse now on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass.
There is admittedly a lift, through the middle of Bergmassiv, but the real regional and Lesefreuden the tap fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The totally verglaste Innenraum is bright and transparent, gun-shy Klinkerboden and the elegant lights clearly speak the language of a public Stadtplatzes.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It is already looking for Parkbank, the dog and boys and Mädels playing football.
Books and everywhere, books, books.
'We usually the's bookshelves along the façade, and in the centre is a large, dark areas, which mostly uncongenial and impersonal way is,' says Winy Maas.
We have the classic Raumkonfiguration on its head and the Lesebereich of comfortable inside out.
The interior is Bücherbergs shrewdly: in the middle are offices, Internet library is, Schachclub, environment centre and Haustechnikzentrale.
A particular pleasure, the black's bookshelves, the times Wandverkleidung, sometimes Brüstung, sometimes Stiegengeländer.
Optics, are alien to Haptik and smell.
Even die-hard architects and Civil Engineers shake whether of the unknown Baustoffs the head.
'We wanted to work here with Recycling-Materialien ", declared Joop Trouborst, in the project manager Stadtgemeinde Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And we are in a friesländischen farms operating in a fitting one day waste from the agriculture.
For many years, we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and in fields as a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies Wurzelunterlage.
That is cheap and zeiteffizient.
The slender textiles is one, two Saisonen, then it is ready for the Sperrmüll.
For the library was the fleece carried - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates squeezed.
Under pressure and Hitzeeinwirkung verfärbt the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogenous, belastungsfähigen material that a bissl for new cars and a bissl after Sportschuh smell.
After 105 stages is reached at the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 metres long used in Literaturcafé we will not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also with Dutch Kroketten eingetopften Ficusbäumen and rewarded.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right Luftfeuchtigkeit in Literaturgebirge.
Donations for the new soul
'You do not believe it would of course, but this House is despite the many Glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology,' says Trouborst.
Heated and cooling, geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz is, it seems that the sun, even in sunny days only briefly Interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder, the right to be outside glass, serve as Beschattung and begin a large part of the sun.
The Raumklima is very pleasant.
Do the rest fully automated Rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptics from the IT sector, dared already the way in the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, even as the Boekenberg Spijkenisses' long overdue soul '.
The reason: the opening of a few weeks ago was invited all residents, a book from his personal stock.
It is for the time being the optical gaps in the not yet fully bestückten library - currently 70 000 of them - be filled.
The concept is clear.
The shelves are filled by obenhin.
'nothing is worse than a half-empty library,' says architect Winy Maas.
'I think that thanks to our invitation has now of all inhabitants of a certain relationship with this new House.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
That is those Königsdisziplin MVRDV we have succeeded in the jargon, the European identity.
Spijkenisse Literaturgeschichte has written.
As young and uneducated it may be.
That is finally a starting point for identity.
