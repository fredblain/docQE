Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency - as a Member of this Space zwanzigstes. Poland is so that the second Member State from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was ESA-Mitglied on 12 November 2008).
Poland began in 1994 a close cooperation with the ESA and participated in the following years in several ESA-Projekten.
The path of Poland in the space began, however, much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space sector, which is not always understanding.
I would remind you here, for example, the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December in the Warsaw Observatory 1933, in which the author of ideas from its pioneering Kosmonautik 'to' presented.
The ideas of the young engineer (another. 1905), the audience, however, cold, and after years, still Šternfeld that only Dr Jan Gadomski interest shown in his work.
Šternfeld won the year in 1934 Kosmonautik 'for' entrance to the of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten Prix REP-Hirsch.
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of Astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines published he wrote several hundreds of articles and books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis of internationally recognised contribution to the development of space has been appreciated by, among other things, that one of the crater on the side of the moon erdabgewandten after it has been appointed.
Already in 1925 a Eisenbahn-Draisine has been built in Poland, for which a Raketenantrieb was planned.
The author of the text and the details of this project were unfortunately unknown.
It is not even been clarified, whether the missile taking-off or on the brakes on the Draisine should be used.
The information on this come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 began with the Polish infantry raketenbetriebenen munitions.
The research, the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the traditional documents is clear that the research to the stage of practical tests was reached.
The research was then, however, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht suspended.
In 1937, appeared in the press of the originating. Rohoziński message draft fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete, and in the following year, the work 'Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza' of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war were all projects to military use of the suggested by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinated.
The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of work, his work, however, the war ended.
Other articles appeared after the war on space travel thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society will take place in 1954 in the Novemberausgabe the magazine Problemy, in the four major article of the space.
The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the research of space future.
Already in its inception in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft a PTA accession to the 1951 established International Federation for space, and indeed the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956 proper a Member.
The following year was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space.
This office, he had, until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA participated in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1 has been completed, in 1957, the first start on 10 October in 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1 800 metres around 80 cm was long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built, and in the Błędów-Wüste Flugtests 1959 began with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 m in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further stage should already be able to make real scientific work - the missile RM-34 should an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of Höhenwinden.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
Successor of the first missiles of the type RM was in the years 1962 to 1965 developed Meteor-1-Rakete.
The missile was conceived as Zweistufenrakete their overall length, and the take-off weight 510 cm was 32 500 kg.
Three types of this missile have been developed, and (Meteor-1A -1B -1C), which each other, in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area, with 0.4 litres to be legalised, Meteor-1B on 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C on 0.62 litre.
The maximum altitude, in all three types of 37 km.
In the years in 1965 until 1968 was developed in the Meteor-2-Rakete Luftfahrtinstitut, whose first Flugtests began in October in 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kilograms and was able to 10 kg applicable in a level of around 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 being built.
It is also worth pointing out the accession of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, on the two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed.
Poland participated in the framework of the Interkosmos-Programms also in the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second Interkosmonaut.
