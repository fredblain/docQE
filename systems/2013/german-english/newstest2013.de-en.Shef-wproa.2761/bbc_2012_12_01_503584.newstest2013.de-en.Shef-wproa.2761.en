Mexico ’ s Enrique Pena Nieto is facing difficult start
While Mexico ’ s future President Enrique Pena Nieto on his term of office, prepared by the BBC Will Grant analysed the forthcoming challenges and mixed feelings of its people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even better days ago, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday was a ring of steel, several important routes in the capital absperrt and on the roads for chaos.
The aim was not, however, commuters on the way to work to disrupt demonstrators, but to prevent Parliament to achieve.
On Saturday, Mexico ’ s new President Enrique Pena Nieto the Präsidentenbinde and the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon ’ s, Mexico, to prove economically well, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, in the last six years has cost 60 000 lives.
'My Administration is strongly committed to the violence to reduce Nieto Pena', said at the beginning of this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he was on an equal footing with the US President, was Pena Nieto as Governor of his Heimatstaats Mexico.
In this densely populated, rambling part of the country's capital city surrounds the opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote small town Valle del bravo remembered, for example, like to him.
Inhabitants of Urlaubsorts him write the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to achieve the city, you can drive one of the motorways, the Pena Nieto built and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy streets, here again.
With his behalf, badges are also outside of a modern Sportzentrums and of an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
'We expect real and lasting changes', as his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, as Congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, regarding the safety and economy is concerned, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera is that the Party after 12 years of outside the Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, above all, but it is also someone who can listen to.
But on the other side of the state do not share this view, many people on their former Governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the paved roads of Valle del bravo not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the Community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year the military was involved in the neighbourhoods, in order to combat drug gangs operating, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In a corner of fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill have been in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murders of women.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto in the state of Mexico have been more than 1,000 women murdered - a statistic which even the city of Ciudad Juarez, for their violence and murders of innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that it is the problem of feminicide, during his term of office, at least not adequately tackled.
But his government in the worst case, have their eyes closed.
In a Betonbau, typical of the run-down neighbourhoods, is fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as I think they are photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows.
The official version of events, committed suicide Mariana 2010.
But their family believes that it was murdered by their partners.
'When I arrived in their home, it seemed as if their bodies have been washed', remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that they had been beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already begun.
While their mother told their history, has a picture of the wall of Mariana down to us. It is in addition to a cross appropriate that a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, as the family, we have until now.
The authorities have dealt with me, as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.
They want their judgment simply accepted and shut up.
'But that is not possible, if there were so many errors and omissions,' says it.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday, he receives the Präsidentenbinde is also a great responsibility.
Tens of Mexican families were in the last six years of violent crime, and the new President has promised during his term of office, particularly to attend to this problem.
'I hope, as President, it is as it was as Governor,' says the PRI-Kongressabgeordnete Olvera in Valle del bravo.
But that is exactly what is the fear of the families of victims in Ciudad Neza most.
