Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes: 'basketball was my life'
The Weltenbummler Basketballs Hetin of Héctor ',' Reyes, was the Korbsport longer than 60 years and has around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of Basketballs of the country as Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes.
Before it by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, was Rexes 6 years, it is part of the sport as a player lower classes, players in the first National League, authorised representative and head in BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketballverbands.
'My life I have drafted in basketball many hats, even several at the same time, as I was President of the BSN, CEO of the national team and President of the Union in the 1990s was', remembered Reyes in a visit by Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
'basketball was my life.'
With this statement not exaggerating Reyes.
The walls of his House are almost all with photographs and memories of its long career decorated and they show.
In the heart of Bayamón
The emotionalsten memories are those in his time in the Vaqueros of the middle of the 1950s when players until 1982, where he 15-year-old anniversary as Director of the club or Mitgeschäftsführer celebrated.
'The were my best years, the most part, because I have enjoyed by eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967, it is as CEO be Mitgeschäftsführer or coach.
There were many rewarding years, including the five championships successive 1971 to 1975.
And then, I am with the championship in 1981, the year of Debüts of Jerome Mincy in BSN.
From then took 'Cuco' Ortiz, a very good administrator was, 'says Reyes.
I remember that genes Bartow me here, as a trainer worked and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big players.
You do unto him? '
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, Puerto Rico has ever had.
Subsequently the recommended Bartow Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, and go through naturalisation Werfer was one of our best.
I know, as he said that if a championship Mincy for Bayamon, Gausse for a further.
With the championship the Vaqueros Gausse he was granted, but from a distance in 1988, because it already at the top of the Union.
At this time, he drew its application and the of Mincy to enjoy in the national team.
I remember when the first time, we in the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the US won.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, the fourth place in which we showed what actually bronze ought to be, if not the Canadian referee of us would have been the last Spielzug the second time, said Reyes repeated.
This group of the World Cup was in 1990, the best national team, which you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those which, in the 2004 Olympics against the dream team won.
My favourite is but the team of panamerikanischen Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we gold and the team of the US won a battle, as then, as they are against us in the World Cup bronze won.
In the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Robert Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz) once again, but also the young players (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the Brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, the 1990, for a Knieverletzung not been able to be present.
A team, which perhaps in terms of figures was not the best, but with which we won a gold medal us great pleasure and the country, was that of the 1995 in Neuquén vorolympischen tournament ’ s, Argentina.
With players such as' Canito 'Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blockage of players because of the events in the Panamerikanischen Games in Mar del Plata, any prediction, we got to the gold medal.
Who was the best players of Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
Its figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level so as Piculín.
And this without his career in the various leagues into account, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We had a number of good coach as Julio Toro, flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys like the work of Leo Arill well.
What is the best glaubst you what you have achieved in the Association of?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 until 1995, which initially BSN the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What remains for you to do?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The boys in Ponce for example only play in their territory and only in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children needlessly many visits and Games.
At least, I see the result of the prescribed and training courses for coach, Tisch-Offizielle and referees.
I am proud of.
What rabbits you today?
I hear music, like to see my time in videos of music enjoy my grandchildren and YouTube, and I am a Basketballspiel.
I enjoy the society and, of course, my wife Isabel, which was always on my side.
