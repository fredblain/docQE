Rakfisk from Norway: is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest standard of living - and not only in Europe but around the world.
The key of the country could do with the local appetite for rather nasty smelling fish have to do?
We note a selection überreifer cheese.
We in the midst of a crowd platziere it against dirty, more humid.
And they leave that a week.
Approximately one must the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk imagine that one of the major delicacies Norway.
I am in the small town Fagernes, almost three hours of Oslo.
There is a spectacular, snow landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which simply is not to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, the - depending on how stinkend its fish would like - to a year in water ferments.
If in Norway the darkness of the country and the weather is colder will flock Norwegians, to a celebration here in Fagernes that this, now, really very bestechenden speciality is devoted.
'You it eats raw and carries it then, with a glass aquavit down', says Havard Halvarsen, in fact the local fire station is working, but as a so-called 'Rakfisk-General' the festival.
Around us to eat Fischwürfel people to take small and large quantities of alcohol.
'Mansche people may aquavit more than the Rakfisk,' says Havard.
The spirit can smell.
I have some pausing to cost.
If it avoids setting Rakfisk to bring in Nasennähe, it is not bad, such as sushi, the bus behind a very long.
Rakfisk is the product of a quite different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no first and fish in the autumn in luftdichten Salzwasserfässern has been watered.
In the deepest winter Fermentierung he was then, after a long and - no doubt, by means of alcohol tempered end - eaten.
Even before a generation saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and, mainly in the US.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a prosperous labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, not that long ago was much richer than Norway, skilled immigrants.
Rakfisk will be seen as something important - as an essential, if strict riechender part of the Norwegian history.
He belongs to the more expensive courts, which we can buy here.
But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich proud costs EUR 10.
Norway is not often in the world press, and most people, that seems not to disturb.
Here we are still hates, Anders Breivik - to name those racist extreme right, the last year, 77, men, women and children.
Instead, we only refers to the 'incident of 22 July'.
Norwegian find it difficult to accept that someone in its peace-loving country to such brutal murders is capable of.
The main responsibility for today ’ s wealth of Norway is since the early 1970 ’ s growth of the largest oil and Gasindustrien the world.
'But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well, "says Anna, our waitresses, the round trays with reifem Rakfisk distributed and with its long fair-haired hair and the stechend blue eyes of the Nordic ideal.
We are a - as they say - prudent people.
Her English is just as the most people here impeccable.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not have ostentation.
Norway is dealt with its oil wealth very careful - a large part of the Branchenerträge will for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.
As in the years leading up to the Great Depression all the money raised, it does not had its purse, Norway firmly closed.
'As long as we in the winter of ski and in the summer, can go, we are happy,' says Anna.
'And Rakfisk eat', of course, she adds with unbeschwertem laughter.
I am in the snow and for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
So a Elch-Burger is certainly something different. The hefty meat enjoy me.
But in the evening is once again the Stinkefisch of the diet.
The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several Veranstaltungsorten to organise a Rakfisk-Dinner, in the guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish Geruchssinne vote in favour of.
There is a Live-TV-Schaltung to a with bird there were Showmaster, which is surrounded by tables with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
'What is the sum total of you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?'
'There are our points Havard'.
One where and laughs.
A man of his seat falls, perhaps, from the aquavit overwhelmed.
But it is perhaps the strict haze of the whole of the fish.
