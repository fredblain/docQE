The film Argo: if 's worst, Hollywood of Justice
In November 1979 occupied a mob Islamist students demonstrating the US Embassy in Tehran, 52 and diplomats as hostages.
For their release they requested the extradition of the ousted Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, after the revolution in the US had fled, which for decades on the regime ’ s policy seems certain to be respected.
For the American Government, there were no positive outcome from this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah, since this is the confidence of its allies in other countries would have severely damaged.
At the same time it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime has resulted, the release of hostages.
It was a serious blow for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to retrieve made it even worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released for 444 days ago, after negotiations by the Algerian Government had been given.
The fate of the hostages to home, a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film director of the Argo and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, the United States, a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message was six Botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight.
This ended after many complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; helped to bring them a flamboyant story to Verdeckung to its true identity - they were travelling with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, the supposedly in the country visited Drehorte for a science-fiction.
Combination of Genres
The experts' for 'Exfiltration, Tony Méndez, developed plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywood.
So that the camouflage was credible, article published on this film in peer-reviewed journals, press conferences held, and the fictitious Produktionsgesellschaft had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, at the same time, but also a so-called 'Caper Movie', i.e. the history of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean 's Eleven.
This change in the film Stimmungsebenen - on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen from Teheran (in the contemporary ikonische be Titelsequenz photographs shown, and also in the Filmfassung the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easily be taken to its extreme.
And then there is still the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions - men in suits on Besprechungstisch, on the Amtsfluren, on the telephone...
Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable start of his career.
From a belächelten actors is a respectable director, and also as an actor, it is now no longer the aim of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third movie The after the whodunit No childsplay (Gone baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in the soil Boston of the director.
The sense of the atmosphere was one of the place to the characteristics, which the previous films this film director, the standard Hollywood abhoben.
Affleck proves this sense, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "'will be played.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the Eingangssequenz the storming of the message is in its clarity, and gives very impressive, the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability, if that happens, somewhere the history.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong Filmstab in a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much to act in too many places
The director had also to reflect that the history is not many in the cinema sense exciting scenes.
With the little but he is working quite successfully, and the reality sometimes rather nachhilft - then what is not always so elegantly works (the scenes, in the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone call in America is averted, or the chase on the runway, somewhat curious).
The weakness of the Argo is too broad spread by the need, too much to act in too many places have to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood-Mitarbeiter very charming, their figures but would have more areas deserves, and they are in the film far not alone.
Afflecks a film is losing traction. It is a film, with some interest and the shaping and to a thriller reminiscent of the 70 years Retro-Stil can approve.
However, it inspires enthusiasm difficult.
As a reminder to a until today, in some way of living of history and as proof of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, however, he is sufficient.
