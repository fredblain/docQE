NKÚ-Chef: control of the failed Schwarz-Systems by fault of the policy
The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts on good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, however, is in their application.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Mr Miloslav Kala.
'A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that this is not the case with us, "Kala comment on the current situation.
A similar outcome is also appears to have a common control by Czech and German auditor.
As a negative Praxisbeispiel it introduces the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so-called 'Schwarz-System'.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS the entrepreneurs not trouble with controls - is the system is now banned or permitted?
'A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then surely cannot simply Regierungsvorsitzende, and this one, whose duty now even the monitoring of compliance with the law is, in its work', is hindering Kala.
At the meeting of the Temporary Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, in the framework of the laws of both countries on public contracts have been compared with each other.
What did it because in practical terms?
It is a parallel examination, with which we have started around two years ago.
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature to establish how to handle public contracts are to build on the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All this, we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet completed, we were extremely interesting differences. In general terms, are the laws we are perhaps even a little 'strict and perfect', the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more precise rules. We must also with the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? what is for you for this project?
It is precisely such a common control could help us that we stop constantly to an improvement of the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this is obviously not particularly positive.
Efficiency means that a matter to a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
It is perhaps even so that we in this way the system only with excessive paperwork "burden", and those who seek loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold is higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.
As is the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority, as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
What the authorities is concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ the Federal Audit Office that is built as with us and also on a college, which is only slightly different, will be set up. In principle, however, similar to work both authorities.
The powers are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, a federal state, i.e. that it is these courts of auditors in the individual Länder - it is different from the German system of our.
The only receives BRH must monitor what is in line with our public funds.
Public resources which are of the counties, and communities are administered, let there be subject to control.
What the German legislation is concerned, is the easier than our?
In general, I would like this without any definite indications only compare. Nevertheless, Germany, in some ways, often described as a model, but it certainly cannot say that Germany in particular, is better.
This is perhaps remember that the auditors are better?
This certainly not, however, as I said: comparisons of this kind may I do not particularly like to.
This is still be noted that, those countries which are a model for us, also with the problems.
Otherwise they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, is it not?
What the Czech legislation, what significance for your authority, the revision of the Vergabegesetzes feel you have any impact?
Given that this new directive is only a short time in force, is it not yet in our assessments.
Since our controls afterwards, we must take place here with a degree of delay.
We have more impact felt in the preparation of future controls - as we have the new control 'identification of risks of inefficiency' introduced and with this almost 14, public contracts examined and analysed - this will, of course, the amendments, because the thresholds change the conditions for certain types of contracts were among the modified
You see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption.
It can, however, the problem, that the rules' strict 'and not be more can be met.
Under the previous rules are a test unterzogenen people to the agencies (for example, in the event of an operational programme of the Regional Policy, the Regional Council) to be accountable, so that any breach of the Vergabegesetzes a violation of the budgetary discipline.
However, it is then even stricter sense, the law?
I do not think that in this way.
The system must exclude those who attack and to abuse the system, and not penalise those who a formal errors committed to the actual decision-making not.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say first of all, what is not successful.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called 'Schwarz-Systems' would be helpful, what exactly does this mean?
Is the Schwarz-System now banned or permitted?
A law must, but its application, and if something is forbidden by law, then surely cannot simply Regierungsvorsitzende, and this one, whose duty now even the monitoring of compliance with the law is, in its work.
He can say: 'We change the law and allow the matter', but he cannot say that we act as if nothing would be.
The procurement law which owes much contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is for the protection of public competition also correct.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the contract with the best offer simply because of Formfehlern is excluded.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is what I believe that we are lacking.
