'The people that I want to save the Republic, but I am merely an amateur' claims Okamura.
Senator, as is the idea, for the office of President to stand for?
It is not my intention, Senator or to be President.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would get us anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic since 20 years will be plundered, as thieves free, while the people of the taxes and the retirement age to be increased.
I had no ambitions, politicians.
But when I see something, what I do not like, then I am trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and that independent and parteilos, I have no other way to influence the things, as for senator or the President to stand.
In the Senate, you have managed, and then straight to the way in the Burg.
You will not turn our backs on your voters?
I have said all the time that I have the fight for the Burg after the result of Senate shall include.
Later, I have this clarified and said that I stand for the office of President, if I am elected to Senator.
My aim is not the role. The role is an instrument with which I can implement my vision.
For as much influence and I do not need a strong mandate.
The difficulty, but not only that we, as people in the pub and the television, but any, the change anything.
Come to the media, which is a wish to deprive the honour, and the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
About me that I was claimed, for example, journalists would be bribed or that I was Jiří Paroubek advisers.
We are talking about your vision.
The fight for the Burg, you have with the position of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million kroner.
You have to change legislation.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can table legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizens, I have campaigned for the tour guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone from the right or left with a good proposal is rejected this deliberately, and the population only on.
As an independent parteiloser I do not have a far greater potential, support from all parties represented in Parliament, to win.
My advantage is that I and without Schubladendenken Parteidogmen from every party that is what our country is the best.
You see itself as a person in the policy, rather the left or right?
From Czech point of view, it seems to me that the left me rather see the people.
For me is this Rechts-Links-Denken but completely irrelevant.
For me is important that we can make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone to the left or right-wing camp; I would like to combine the people.
I always support public any good solution, even if these KSČM or of the ODS, and as I am against bad ideas.
It does not like you, if someone you described as populists.
But can you confirm this, what you have just said?
If you draw up a business plan in a company, then you will have a Idealziel and a vision.
And this would like to you.
This can be as call populism, but all the proposals which I have referred to work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support in Parliament you remain mere buzzwords.
And so that you come in the policy in the long term, not far.
Or do you think that you, if you only long enough with the people, will be able to talk, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to convince them on our side, in order to secure these goals.
As President, it would be not a problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties to live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors to the statute book.
And if the Angesprochenen would then have to say why they reject it.
A strong personality, which refers to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
If you take only once the direct election of the Presidents, which was a credit to the public pressure.
I would like to say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius still an intellectual.
I am trying to allies for my views and vision.
With the politics, I have only just beginning and try, for my programme to find the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the situation itself; and if it does not work, then I am sure in six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little, as if Okamura the Czech Republic should save.
I am not a savior.
I know that nothing can I alone; that is why I voted with a number of famous people talked about, whether they do not want to stand for the Senate.
I have spoken, for example, with Radim Jančura, however, in work.
I have also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, the fraud in trade with ease of fuel oil.
My candidacy I began with the premise that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sixty per cent of voters are not at all to the elections, and the, who have left, have often elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two Independent.
People have such a Senatszusammensetzung elected, that changes only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and Bezirkshauptmänner.
Do you think about the creation of a own party?
I have not yet considered, because I do not have time, the past to check every potential Parteimitglieds, and certainly do not have the money.
I still have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent accounts are only 20 000 CZK.
They have no money?
They are talking about Vermögenserklärungen, what would your?
I appreciate my private wealth to around CZK 60 million.
I have a property in Prague with a value of 25 million, a home for approximately 10 million, a further for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth approximately 10 million, and a Ashton Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, approximately a million is worth. And then I have a few million to the bank account.
The Ashton Martin was a Kindertraum - James Bond liked I have always been in the car, as he went to gallantly, and at the same time, women were fought against the evil.
They drive a Ashton Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you do not want to invest in it.
That is not convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
I have to make debt?
I have already 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my programme is not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to the campaign own means.
The costs for the campaign will in fact, covered by my salary as a senator.
But the Senatorengehalt I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not the English school finance, the 30 000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
You will remain so further work as entrepreneurs, in order to have your living?
You said that you did not be cut back these activities?
But this is not with the level of salary.
As promised, I have my activities partly reduced.
Thus, for example, my deputy director of the travel agents in the spring.
The people want to see me as Samaritans, of the Republic of saving.
But I also have to live by something.
Monthly income on which you were used as an entrepreneur?
Around 200 000 and 400 000, and that is still so.
As President, I would however, my undertakings.
The full discussion, you will find in the Samstagsausgabe of Právo.
