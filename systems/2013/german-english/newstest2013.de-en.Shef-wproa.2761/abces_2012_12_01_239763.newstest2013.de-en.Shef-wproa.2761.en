The most difficult profession of the world: the human Arbeitstiere of Kawah Ijen
For four euro, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk, if they are 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, stony ways.
There are people, for their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 Minenarbeiter who earn their lives by sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must down to every day on the ground of his Kraters rise, where the gas from the earth ausströmende schwefelhaltige been in contact with the air.
Having great Schwefelsteine has undermined, as a whole can weigh up to 70 kilos, transported it in two Bambuskörben on his shoulders on the slope paths of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, to a level of 2386 metres, but the exhausted agencies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in Schildkrötentempo, using the balance and keep their steps must be careful, so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step of their lives, as a French tourist happened in the years ago, the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen plummeted.
The Minenarbeiter of Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur, which reduce them.
The top, they pave the way between the tourists, as Zirkusaffen photographs and run with the tiring serious baskets three kilometres to the balance, a Minengesellschaft a little further down a EUR 1 850 metres has established
Society is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960, the presence of the volcano said) and (never better exploiting its workers, which they 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) for every kilogram of sulphur, pays.
The selling them then for per 10 000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widespread and for the manufacture of matches next to, fireworks, cosmetics, Dynamit and even the bleaching of sugar will be used.
'Because we normally, we receive 70 kg for any way around 46 000 rupees (3.8 euro)', which normally Anto us three routes on the day.
For every line he needs three hours that he is completely managed, at the end of the day, but then he has 138,000 breast cancers detected rupees (11.5 euro).
What a lousy pay for such a downright inhuman effort, but it is three times as much as he would deserve the fields.
'The Tagelohn the Minenarbeiter here, where the Kaffeeernte 15,000 rupees (1.2 euro) on the day will be paid and the average monthly two million rupees (167 euro), is very high', the agencies, the previously as bricklayers on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euro) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and this for a reason that in Indonesia as important as the sulphur is: 'I have a girl from Bali, where they are married Hindus, and I have brought them after Java, in order to convert to Islam'.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, a coughing fit often and its eyes are due to the toxic gases prickly.
The 27 jährige Anto, for three years of his life on Kawah Ijen at risk, whose sulphur in the already the first traces, although he has his face with a mask and covers Spezialbrille.
Anto has asthma, breathes coughing fit with difficulty, and its eyes are often because of the toxic gases from the volcano prickly.
This is the price for the achievement of his dream must pay.
'I will be working here for another two years, because I have a Laden open or Spanish or French would like to learn', he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could be a tourist guides, waiters or on the reception of a hotel work done, but instead of the work of a Tragesels.
It shares a dirty Holzhütte with other agencies and is every morning at two o'clock at night because of the sulphur also applying, where its characteristic yellow colour in the darkness bläulich is conspicuous.
The shadow of challenging it is in the light of a small Stirnlampe to his helmet he has bought by his own money, in the crater.
Approximately 400 agencies invite the Kraterboden the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite its great profits, the Minengesellschaft the Schwefelabbau not mechanised order to save on costs and provides the agencies on their own account work and weight be paid, no equipment.
They also get not share the 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) contract per camera, the guardian of this natural parks, together with the entrance fee of EUR 15 000 rupees (1.2 euro) of the tourists, the photographing of the volcano and human Tragesel.

It is in the situation, up to 110 kg and rest assured that it continues, 'as long as it is', because it the money for the education of its three children aged between 10 and 18 years needs.
I will not retire here, I will die because of the volcano of my life was.
Even if the sulphur the throats of burning down and the eyes Jucken, if the wind and suddenly the Minenarbeiter in the thick pillars einklemmt from the crater rise, are the men so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... of course, apart from the usual was breathing with difficulty's vote on, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders of the distorted by the weight of the elements.
With the basket on his back is merely Unainik with its 53 years in the situation, 50 kg.
Every day, he and his associates break 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, the three lorries on a Ziegenpfad between the Gebüsch the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
'I will not retire here, I will die because of the volcano of my life was' declared Unainik, and it opens his mouth far, in which some teeth.
Of his five children is the most ancient with its 30 years as Schwefel-Träger.
Time passes, but the meagreness considers generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: the of those who as human Lastesel on Kawah Ijen work.
