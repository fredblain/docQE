The word 'human rights' is missing in the Constitution
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo, show the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia law as a basis is a controversial issue.
The Egyptian President Saharan waters not with emotion.
We must create the transition.
'And that it is successful, is my responsibility, before the people and before God,' he said on state television.
His speech was the whole people, but above all to the Coptic Christians, the Liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular.
Because they all hopelessly divided, so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.

But what the 61-jährige engineer, of a doctorate the American University of Südkalifornien, really want to save, the Egyptians, is not quite clear in the world.
The judiciary is to be ousted?
Indeed, the Article 234 dominated by the Islamist 100-person Constituent Assembly because in a night, 15-stündigen Parforceritt have been rushed through some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also states in the draft law, the title of 'the principles of Islamic law'.
But what does' Principles'?
That was and is open to interpretation and it is feared that the Islamists the vague wording and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia law.
This suggests at least a newly hinzugeführter Article: the Sharia law in all these matters are the influences on this point, the main Islamic institution of the country with great power in the whole of the Sunni Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that the clergy overseeing the legislation, which de facto the disempowerment of the judiciary.
In many Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also a problem: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These Courts while Mubarak ’ s rule, have served to the repression of political opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11 000 civilians in Militärhaft.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, 'the true nature of the Egyptian family' protect 'and their morality and promote its values'.
That is legally as vague wording that state institutions, with the help of this article even the content of cinema and literature could control.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
Incidentally, is no article expressly the equality of men and women.
This prohibits another, the Prophet Mohammed and its envoy to insult or to slander.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished, remains unclear.
Just as questionable is the wording of the 'insulting people' is banned.
There is already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of Leader?
Open to interpretation, as so much in the design, Morsi to sign and after his words' very soon, 'the Egyptians to the referendum will be presented.
'The revolution has returned'
The opposition is taking shape, for weeks, against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of gathered in an agreement on on Friday evening, in Cairo ’ s Tahrir Square and promised, the Charter, even before it can enter into force.

'We are still not to tire of the blood of our brothers is not yet been atoned', the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
A number of judges and announced that the referendum is not want to monitor, making it would be invalid.
'The Koran is our Constitution'
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood inflated Gegendemonstration in turn, the safe side, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a Massengebet on the other Nilufer before the Cairo university.

They called for by Morsi: 'Säubere the country,' and extremely: 'The Koran is our Constitution.'
A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything would have started civil.
Morsi ’ s supporters were obviously not at risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated, both the opponents to endorse the draft EU Constitution and the supporters would have said loud and clear.
Now is the time, the people at the ballot box to decide the direction in which the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is safe.
'The word' human rights is not even before '
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this upsurge of constitutional process, which actually have until February and to involve all social forces.
The 48-jährige human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when, under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share the belief, but because for him rights are indivisible.
For that he was arrested, beaten, condemned.
'And now is the word' human rights is not even in the new Constitution ', he criticises in conversation with the' world on Sunday '.
Morsi Machtausweitung to all three powers in the state of the lawyer give in.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and Egypt in a new dictatorship.
'Instead to strengthen civil society, they have the President' de facto override, complained Saeda.
But a democracy without civil society organisations could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which the ideological Richtungskampf the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could take revenge.
A protestor on the Tahrir warns: 'Your gebährt a monster that it can no longer control'.
