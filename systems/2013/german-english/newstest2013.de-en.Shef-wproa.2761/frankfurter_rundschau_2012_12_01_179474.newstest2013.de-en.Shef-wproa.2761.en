Messenger, NASA discovered ice in the Mercury has continued
Has the messenger probe is proof that it is on the planet Mercury has continued to hold.
The ice cover will perhaps be up to 20 metres fat.
The US-Raumfahrtbehörde NASA, the existence of ice on the planet Mercury has continued.
Although it is the closest the sun, there are some frozen water, as from three on Thursday in the 'Science' Fachmagazin studies published.
The Tube messenger have found evidence that, in the region which is permanently in the shadow of the planet, the ice.
This is at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 metre thick.
The water was probably of comets or possibly also in the Mercury has continued to the asteroid, are taken.
No one would like the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the Chefwissenschaftler the Messenger-Sonde, Sean Solomon.
Can the temperature in the Mercury has continued to achieve by 426 degrees Celsius.
But the discoveries could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other areas of the solar system.

One of the largest and most imaging Hubble-Teleskops: the Whirlpool-Galaxie
According to the means of the Rwandan Spiralgalaxien to be true works of art.
The published by the European Southern Observatory decided to include shows the several thousand light years away in Trifid-Nebel Sternbild shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three sections, dreigespalten), as dark Staubstreifen the fervent heart of the Sternen-Geburtsstätte dreiteilen.

Our insights into space telescopes the most important:
The telescope 1608 by Hans Lipperhey to be invented - even before Galileo Galilei Sternenbeobachtung a year later on.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes increasing - and the insight that they provide, deeper.
30 years, namely of 1947 in 1975 was the Hale-Teleskop in San Diego Palomar-Observatorium close to the greatest Fernrohr the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Telescope Binocular.
It is equally look into space of two mirror, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of Gran Telescopio to recognise the Kanareninsel of La Palma, is enormous - alone the mirror is 10.4 metres in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save money.
Nevertheless, it is a diameter of some eleven metres.
Detriment of the favourable construction: the telescope is in his Höhenwinkel us - and this in its flexibility.
This too is in Höhenwinkel Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas.
Its specificity: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is - despite comparatively low Spiegeldurchmesser - to the of the world's largest Spiegelteleskope.
With the help of a Radioteleskops in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers space after Außerirdischen signals.
The Radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the 'Search Project for Extraterrestrial Intelligence' (SETI) anyone can help by Computerbesitzer he Rechenleistung available.
Look at the Observatory of the European Sternwarte (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Is the Very Large Telescope here - that his name.
With its total of four mirrors the Fernrohr can also the medium-sized Infrarotspektrum ausleuchten.
Also to the Chilean ESO-Observatorium European extremely Large Telescope will the planned.
Hauptspiegel be to include fat 42 metres - and from almost a thousand Spiegelelementen be put together.
With pictures but until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck-Teleskope on a Hawaiian root that volcano Mauna KEA as the largest of the world.
They offer two mirror with an average of 10 metres.
The Keck-Teleskope are part of the Mauna-Kea-Observatoriums which, alongside them with the Subaru-Teleskop and the IRTTF looks in the sky.
Also on Mauna KEA a new, huge telescope - with a Spiegel-Durchschnitt of 30 metres.
Here it is an illustration to gaze at.
The most important impressions from space, however, does the Weltraumteleskop Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990 it already provides pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, is seeking the Weltraumteleskop Kepler after extrasolaren planet - mainly for such, the inhabitable.
On 2 February 2011, from NASA announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn have been identified.
In the picture is the last Startvorbereitungen on Weltraumteleskop Kepler documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope until 2018 (JWST) will be on board a Ariane5-Rakete into space.
The Primärspiegel of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is in light of the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists assume that the South Pole of the ice Mercury has continued to exist.
However, there is no reliable data, since the messenger far closer to the North Pole for the planet.
For decades have Radarmessungen hingedeutet that it is in the Mercury has continued to hold.
Messenger-Sonde launched by the 2004 - the first, the focal point - the Mercury has continued to the scientists have now certainty.
