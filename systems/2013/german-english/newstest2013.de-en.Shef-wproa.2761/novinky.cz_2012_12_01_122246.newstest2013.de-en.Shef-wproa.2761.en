Directives for the Aufblasen by balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, of an annual survey on the oddest bank charges course, has decided this year, the competition 'most absurd regulation or idea from the EU-Werkstatt'.
'At this idea has brought us the recently by the EU's plan, a 40% quota of female representation in the management of large European companies', said to introduce Patrik Nacher to the organisation of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Under the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of Versicherungstarife for men and women.
Until then, women in life assurance enjoyed an advantage for the insurance companies, because it objectively less risk.
'Other incredible incursions from the EU-Werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year.
The real vote will take place by the end of February 2013 ', with shared Nacher.
On the controversial regulations is including the mandatory admixture of bioethanol on fuels, in its wake, naturschädigend is that of the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes, or the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen in this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism of chickens in the past, the de facto ban the use of the term "butter 'or the sales ban on conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 centimeters long
The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or several Member States (such as the Czech Republic is trying to be represented at the moment, for example, also with Veto-Drohung to the demands of Czech banks).
Lobby-Interessen were also behind that bananas of the highest Handelsklasse in the EU at least 14 centimeters long and must be 'no' Krümmungsanomalie are allowed.
The European Commission is defended with the argument that it merely harmonisiere the fragmented national standards that would impede the trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables, the EU against the opposition of some countries already weakened by pointing out that the existing directives to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU regulation of last year, in accordance with balloons sale with the reference to that children under the eight years Luftballon aufblasen not without supervision of an adult.
The EU citing an American study in accordance with balloons the leading cause of the suffocation of children.
A similar restrictions already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There is also curious incursions home
Relatively absurd is also a directive, the European officials themselves - everyone in the EU must adopt an official function, because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece is not the name Macedonia and must instead use FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU, so that the Höchstvolumen to Lebensmittelvorräten, on the day of our accession to the area of the Czech Republic are.
The Czech Republic, for example, the volume of crossed then set for Pilzkonserven, for which we have a large fine threatened.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or of the idea of funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were, however, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
'We are disadvantaged by this that we have no sea.
We will be reimbursed in the EU to apply ', said in the autumn of 2004, the then Minister for Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument he gave was that the grain harvest has been very high and the state as a result of the so-called Interventionseinkäufe overcrowded camps.
As the Czech Republic to sea ports have another way, the EU should, according to Palas hundreds of millions of euros of us pay.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far that it is an invitation to tender, on the purchase of cereals from countries organised, which have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for aid provided to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development, under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically, it has to be the means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen act in Brussels.
EU regulations are the exception: bizarre
Regulations are in the Member States, the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulation and, hence, effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserves, according to some experts, however, more recognition.
A serious problem, in view of these experts rather the EU grant money for projects, absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration have in common, but when the budget negotiations have been forced by individual Member States.
Emotions here also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic, similar to other Member States in Brussels about the right to use of specific indications and traditional products have to fight this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic has been for a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, the term 'Olomoucké tvarůžky' defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský we), whose tradition in US up to the 19th century, however, in our manufacturers' Tuzemák 'names.
The name of rum must only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU in the society of the world-famous feta cheese and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinkens now also of Karlsbad Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops.
