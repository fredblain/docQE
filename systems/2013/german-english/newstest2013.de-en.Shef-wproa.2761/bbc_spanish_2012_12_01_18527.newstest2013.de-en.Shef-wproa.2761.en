Singapore babies to save the economy needs
The Singapurer shift the blame that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the costs of the real estate and childrearing.
'The people of Singapore must grow'.
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our civil responsibility and we create life!
It seems incredible that the Verses part of an advertising for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were initially in Singapore this year to a viralen YouTube video.
The sentences are part of a Rapper-Songs, the local slogans such as' pushing will be a 'Bao' (loaf) in the foot, about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which has undergone the video, preserves the hope that the advert on entertaining way, to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative head Alexander Hamilton says that he use the power of the music to the people to their 'national duty'.
This is something only for the Internet, we therefore had to make it amusing and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The breed we are the worst of the world, that is why we have said that it is an issue that we have had to look after.
We knew that the government much tried, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of Speed-Dating-Abenden (rapid flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas creatively they were, but not necessarily led to success.
Therefore, we thought: why do we not something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a Rap to komponieren?
1.2 children
Anyone who takes this issue is not easy, the government of Singapore.
Every year there are 1 300 dollars for political measures to encourage the citizens, more to have children.
A package of the government granted for married couples and parents up to $15 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, hochtechnologischer city-state in South-East Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known.
In accordance with its national Bevölkerungsbehörde the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate of 2 - what is known as Ersetzungsrate - was in 1976.
So why not get the Singapurer more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Executive Director for marriage and family policy of the national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this in a 'better training' and 'greater career'.
'This is the people, except to marry and to form a family much more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities', has declared it.
These changes in the social realities, have higher number of a single person and the delay of marriage and births, the result that the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy, which led to a sharp rise in the uphold those aims of the reduction of the population, resentment in the local population.
In Singapore, there are sites, where the little covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, particularly against the Chinese, the criticism that they maintain low wages and not integrate.
The increase in the immigration will also be seen as one of the reasons that the governing party in Singapore last year, its worst possible election since independence.
Since the elections was an attempt to the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers to be corrected.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the well-known impact on the growth of one nation, the tax revenues, the health costs and the immigration policy has, shows the example of Singapore also unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small homes are built.
It has already, also impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started, the number of small Appartements to control, which are known as' Schuhschachteln and in certain areas of the city must be built.
These Appartements have a Wohnfläche of 46 square metres and show a large Verkaufserfolg.
However, there is concern that they are the lifestyle of the single, and that they can promote the construction firms from large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of Immobilienfirma EL Developers, says that his' Schuhschachteln 'much faster than larger units sell.
They are so popular, and the entities are days and weeks to be sold out even more quickly than the larger units.
This means that it is for our far has very much better.
It is, however, that the new standards the developers clearer guidelines, which previously obstacles placed in the way, if they were too many small units within a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules the way to an increase in the national birth rate might cause, is the talks with the Singapurern in the City of work, that they will not have a major impact.
'The people are strongly stressed, the housing and education is expensive, which is why it is deferred by many' says a young managers.
The children can get others.
'For me, it is important, on my own money and time to have' says another twenty years old man.
Men and women of their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as the reasons that they can have no children.
That is why the Singapurer the last word when it comes to have children - as the government can still do so much.
