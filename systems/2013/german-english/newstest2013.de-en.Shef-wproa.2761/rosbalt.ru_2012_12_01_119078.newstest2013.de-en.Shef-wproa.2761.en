Instead of culture - rosbalt.ru own taste
Rosbalt, the project 'Petersburg vanguard', the city dwellers is devoted to the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the fine list, already high-level representatives of the Petersburg Kunstszene, whose achievements on the borders of the city and the often go beyond recognition in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be known.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill, Mr Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the in red clothed bearded, the one to Russian museum, to Sommergarten, sometimes in Szene-Treffen or Vernissagen them.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also be issued, attract they large numbers of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg sozial-philosophischen artists, the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg vanguard the end of the 1980s, or the beginning of the 1990s.
It is also a man of the city and firework by its presence on the street its citizens a smile in the face and is causing them for good humour.
He recently schnappte a Drehorgel and became the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler, as it is for this difficult role in terms of its K체nstlerdasein, its philosophy and its image was finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you actually always in red and not, for example, in Amber or T체rkis in the city?
I have the red than fashion designers, the elected with the optics and the image.
In this world red is the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society.
In the society calls for everything that differs somewhat from the Graunorm, aggression and bad behaviour.
But I want to by my provocations with the people.
Any of my last provocation was an invitation to dialogue.
- When wusstest you that you must be painter?
- In an exhibition in Kulturpalast Newskij, in my work were issued.
I realised that I must go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painters at the time to end, and new and free painter such as I was incomprehensible.
I am on friendly terms with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the 'Gazonewschina'; hence, 'Puschkinskaja 10', and then that was the first conclusion.
It is me to the theatre, to fashion, music, literature, except to all.
- And all the united in your Art-Klinik... - It was important to me, at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best artists should meet.
In 1995, I have an area in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there to the renovation musikalisch-k체nstlerischen a club for the Boheme that the House of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and, I also remember string with its project 'Ucho Van Goga' go there.
String and his friends, simple songs for Play-back close Jersey, and was one of them also of mature composer Igor Wdowin today.
As the group, began to live to play, for their 'Leningrad'.
Trachtenberg facilitated many programmes before the time of 'Halli-Galli'.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began its great careers, but the foundations he learned with us.
Also the gallery 'D 137 of the club' or 'Griboedov' have their origin in Art-Klinik.
Were to our staff and Stammg채ste.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press, in order to award 'personalities of our town'.
I won in the category of 'artists of the year, and so that I was at the peak.
It is not easy, in new times that old rules to work; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the present time, it is simply, to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: it can be known, without a cultural contribution.
Your work - have a distinctive style.
- Many my images are real gems and clearly the topical and acute the idea.
I will be an exhibition with the subject of 'The Russian museum as a clown'.
Clowns are timeless.
I was previously socially, but now it pains and fear, to be the case.
In a clown blurred all this, and is losing its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have preposterous ideas.
We save the world, for example by making that everyone has fully to dress up.
Now all respects to the clothing and is based on the Outer and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps we should not give a people, but it should in the face of biting.
The deceit disappear by the dress up.
- Before recently we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - A City of Culture should have a hero.
Who, if not I?
Commercial art - can also be nice?
Commercial art - Nowadays there must be careful, respectful and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Previously, the people: the large groups Bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people.
There is now Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to all.
I am no Einhundert-Dollar-Note, which everyone likes.
Now you must consider, whom you will have fallen.
Now everyone has Kultstar roughly 100 supporters.
- On the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand.
- On him are abandoned women, there is a role the sexuell-soziale sphere.
For cultural reasons are 300 people and not 10 thousand, consequently, there is less management, money, and everything is based.
I voted in favour, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy the achievements.
In my youth I have painted such images, at a gathering even in a number of the works of, Falk and Larionow.
I started with images, which normally only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there is often misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and culture.
Consumption has absolutely no culture, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the last culture and grew up with artists in poverty and lived in poverty died and refused to raise money.
This is the culture, which I am in favour.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- the best be cultural experts.
It says: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real tsars it was different, because the tsars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
What we have in St. Petersburg, the experts could, but they will be barred hochrangigerer experts, because it is for the former and properly evaluate them open the way.
Now is only the own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that it honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore other museums must seek.
- What is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is much more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones can art difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more than readers and writers, that is not right.
In Europe, there are many, people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
We are much less.
Art must again be modern, so as to the beginning of the last century.
The project will be from grants the town of St. Petersburg financed
