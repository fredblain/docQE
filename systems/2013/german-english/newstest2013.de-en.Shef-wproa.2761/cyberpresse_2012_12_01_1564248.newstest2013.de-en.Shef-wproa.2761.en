A Republican strategy in order to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat, the electoral fraud.
However, the latter Brennan Center for a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the US, moreover, only 300 cases of fraud.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada are the States for the implementation of the elections in the individual States.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, the new laws announced the procedure for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has, after the elections in November 2010 grown in importance, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries could be recorded.
As a result, 180 draft laws alone were introduced in the year 2011, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.
The new electoral laws demand that the voters and proof of a Lichtbildausweis US-Staatsb체rgerschaft.
In addition, these laws also the periods for the early vote shortened, the right declared invalid, on the day, to register as voters and citizens of the right to vote, for which a Gerichtsakte.
Before the elections in 2006, no US State of the voters asked to produce a Lichtbildausweis.
Indiana was the first federal state, of such a request.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed, this practice to other States.
Over the last two years, encouraged in 34 States draft legislation, with which the voters are forced to produce a Lichtbildausweis.
It is important to note that the US in contrast to Quebec not on a universal cards as the health card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens have, i.e. non-German 21 million people do not of a governmental authority of their state Lichtbildausweis issued.
Moreover, five million Neuw채hler in 2012, not on such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay the necessary card.
Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes disproportionately affected.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years, not on the necessary Lichtbildausweis.
This goes further.
The students, be regarded as the electorate that their voice more for democratic candidates, it is not permitted in several countries, their Lichtbildausweis issued to use its establishment.
On the other hand, these same States allow members of Angel- or Jagdvereinen, the more for the Republican side to choose which of these associations cards issued for elections to be used.
Before 2004, has no state for the rational proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first federal state, of such a request.
For 2011 have a dozen countries, the laws adopted by the voters demand that they demonstrate their US-Staatsb체rgerschaft.
These measures are clearly, to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators 2011 in eight States laws, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
Moreover, you have the right of individuals and groups, those voters limited to assist the wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to electoral registration in the general elections in 2004 helped, around 10 million citizens to register.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuw채hlern 2010 compared to 2006 to 17%.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators in another five States adopted legislation aimed at the period for the early vote.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though it is only 13% of the voters of the federal state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter, only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who have elected in advance.
In contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of voters who elected in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws, the registration of voters.
Several proposals have been through the vetoes of the democratic governors blocked.
The Advocate-General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could limit the damage caused in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States have adopted legislation, which just a Lichtbildausweises demand.
However, the new rules introduced in the year 2012, without doubt, the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
The democratic critics point the party political nature of the laws passed on and to see them as a clear objective of the influence of the results in the crucial States for 2012.
A report of the centres of 2011 Brennan shows that those States that these laws have adopted, 171 of 270 votes, in the Electoral College are needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to with certainty to confirm that these changes to the legislation on electoral system, a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
