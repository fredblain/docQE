Szabo: 'Germans need to make a greater role to play'
Germany has in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine to abstain.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced Berlin to a narrow diplomatic level.
German wave: the beginning of the week, Germany had first signals that it against the request for observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then abstained Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have not done in Gaza.
Germany must now given its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it was not the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstained when it came to a no-fly zone.
Finally, this has been implemented by the NATO.
It is difficult to Germany on important international issues a clear position on the subject?
Yes, it is true.
The reason is that it is precisely its foreign policy, surrounded and away from a policy to pay by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are found in other words, between the fronts.
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I believe that they are still in its role, but they are on the path to a 'more normal "foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as France or Britain.
What does' a normal "foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to national interests to adopt positions, which are independent of which the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy of the economic policy is motivated by the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ’ s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not to offend the.
This plays a role in any case.
But I would also the not too much weight to want, that is not wholly unilateral relationship.
But it is definitely an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the US, by abstaining when important decisions, for example, in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, there is great understanding for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this is such a dramatic rift was, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.
Because it signals but that it will be taken seriously as an international player and its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative.
The United States have been clear for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of the American domestic politics have these differences which exist.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government can, of course, this position publicly not represented.
I believe that the real differences are not so great as they always appear.
If you turn to the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu Obama is not so upbeat about by Netanyahu ’ s policy.
It is Germany difficult, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case today.
So they can not part of a broader and foremost, and must instead be things from their own position.
That they do precisely with the euro.
I believe that in future, Germany will play a leading role, Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Is Germany itself in the role as an important international players - Germany wants to play a major role at all?
Or is still difficult for the leadership of Germany?
Germany is not accustomed to this is still an unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is the country still difficult to a greater role to play.
If we look at us, for example, the euro crisis, because every time, when Germany has a greater role, various anti-deutsche feelings free.
This makes it the Germans not easy.
This is the old problem: you want not be surrounded by hostile countries.
So, Germany is seen in a much more difficult position as the United States.
There must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and this is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, the EU continually fill the vacuum but not at the moment, who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them and they still much less popular, c'est la vie!
