The analyses Higgs-Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs-Bosons last summer, a certain degree of attention, and for good reason.
We believe that in fact, this Boson to nothing less than the mechanism is involved, for the mass of objects in the universe is responsible.
Lastly, it is the last particles, whose existence of the Standard Model - our best or 'least false' statement by the nature and the behaviour of the matter - predicted empirically, but not yet been observed.
But for the physicist, it is still not entirely sure that it really the Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of doubt that we have a genuine new particles, and that the predicted Higgs-Boson greatly resembles the Standard Model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data in this week on a large Physik-Kongress were presented in Kyoto, but it still lacking data, in order to be completely safe.
We nevertheless believe that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a minimal risk, to deceive, and we are looking at what is at stake.
There is in this world a necessarily inescapable law, which means that two objects not at the same time, there can be the same place.
It is not possible, against this rule - and you are trying to break it is not too much, as you will hurt.
Because even if the particle physics a truly strange world is, turns out that it also such a law applies: the Pauli Clausewitzian Ausschlussprinzip, which says that two particles not the same room at the same time, if they can fill in the same 'Quantenzustand', and this' state 'by and large from some of their characteristics.
On this basis, the physicist share the particles in two categories.
In a corner of the good citizens, be described as Fermione and lastly the Pauli principles.
And in the other the Bosonen a vile, gang of anarchists, which nothing is sacred - not in any case this principle, which means that they are in fact, at the same time on the same place.
These Bosonen is in accordance with the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen we are not be discussing and the 'Kraftteilchen', by the major forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson somehow be used.
There must be emphasised, however, that these Bosonen not all such exotic creatures are, as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the Photon or the 'Lichtteilchen', that of 'messenger' of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle speeded up with an electrical goods or the direction of change, the electromagnetic fields precisely in this place 'disrupted', such as a pebble that has been thrown into a pond.
By this' disturbance 'is an electromagnetic wave (light Infrarot- or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon Bosonen and therefore one of the "bearer of force'.
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another area that Higgs-Feld must be ',' disrupted, so that this Boson shows.
However, the Higgs-Feld very much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the pathogens must achieve very high energy, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks zerfurcht.
That is why a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger like CERN necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic fields is again helpful in the relationship between the Higgs and the mass to explain.
There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic fields.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but not others - a piece of paper, for example, would never even in the refrigerator.
Not all particles and equally interact with the Higgs-Feld: those that do have a mass, while the other (as the Photon) no mass.
For what can all these research now be 'good' asks Mrs Plamondon?
For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they will enable the physicists also, all the differences between the observations and the predictions of SM carefully to examine.
There are also numerous physicist, the truly hope that such derogations to be found, since the slightest difference a door to a 'new physics' open and some of the model could fill holes.
We must say that the latter still major shortcomings, since there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which provides approximately 80% of the matter of the universe (once again ups!).
However, when CERN such derogations until now not been found.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
Incidentally, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell-Laboren not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle - which has worked in the Bell Labs, where lasers in the 1960 â€™ s was invented the 1962, and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) has developed - already said that the lasers at the beginning, rather than a 'Laborspielerei'.
Imagine...
Moreover, can also applications from all the instruments which surrounded the research.
Willard Boyle 1969, in turn, has, for example, during its work in the optics a small Lichtsensor developed.
Although it was not the original purpose, the purpose of this sensor today all digital cameras in the world as' an eye and has he 2009 the Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC necessarily change our lives, but it means that it really can never know...
