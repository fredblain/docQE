Wyatt Petronella: I was from Oxford, because I am being bullied Tory
Not only university students today will be attacked for their views
It was always been my greatest dream, a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had those university, I once for the largest Wissenstempel the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance -.
Yet, within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College the end of the 1980s - there I had intended to study, history - I had my suitcase again tackled and so the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it said, I would be, because I had a problem that colleagues in the neighbouring room sex.
The author A N Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university, because I was forced to drink from crockery damaged.
But the truth was less amusing.
I walked away.
Yes, expired, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I come from a private school offers.
I was only for one reason being harassed - a reason, in this supposed cradle of enlightenment in order to narrow and cruel seemed: my now late father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advisers of Margaret Thatcher, and I advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports is suffering a new generation of students of the moderate rights under similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred on Tory-Studenten in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz last week, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative Members of the younger common rooms (JCR) of the corpus of Christ College, they are due to their political views' often active in isolation, attacked personally and for undesirable declared '.
They call for a place in Gleichberechtigungskomitee their College, in order to ensure that their opinions freely can be expressed.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent screened documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right ', the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been demonstrated, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the conservative student Association of Oxford University, in a Rolls-Royce and with silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock protzte.
In other universities say conservative students, they will be as' scapegoats for the introduction of higher fees'.
The 20-year Luke black, Vice-President of the conservative Studentenvereinigung the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper: 'There is a growing Linkstendenz in universities.
The people believe that we are as the Bullingdon club, without us to come at all '.
Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in corpus of Christ, the request for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is' inconvenient '. The 19-jährige Stephanie Cherill, designated President of the conservative student unification of Oxford says that they have in JCR-Mitgliedern a growing opposition to students of the moderate rights observed.
'This is a threat to the intellectual debate and for the well-being of Members', it says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was one such a minority.
As an unbelievably timid 18-Jährige I was in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year had voted in favour of the university, Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education no title of honour.
The atmosphere would have even Stalinists squirm.
In the first days of the Erstsemester-Woche, in the new students and Tutoren know, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the Tutoren the mockery of Tory-Studenten not only duldeten, but even attended it is with pleasure.
Political issues such as the Bergarbeiterstreik, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa have found their way into the areas of the Tutoriums holzgetäfelten.
In my first of these events, I should French texts from the eighteenth century translated into English. On what should come, I was not have been taken.
Wyatt 'Miss', said the tutor Harry Pitt (now died), 'please translate the first paragraph'.
I, in this.
Pitt was a small man with a face as from Kuchenteig, and quite invidious.
"refuse Thatcher-Anhänger to learn, French, or are they simply stupid? 'he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
In my eyes wallten tears.
'I propose that in your leisure a few Französischstunden - so, if you not to your social activities are employed' knurrte me Pitt.
I returned with hängendem capita in my room.
This evening, I sat in the College alone having dinner, as somebody easy on the shoulder tippte.
It was a Englischstudent from the second year called James, as a Member of the conservative student Association presented.
'I know who you are', he said enough.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of Tory, is to be harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher close, it will therefore be worse for you.
The most Tory-Erstsemester give, supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub later, I tried to me.
I have insisted, in all the points that I do not agree with Mrs Thatcher was.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
In conclusion, a philosophy, politics and economy which, ironically, the conservative current Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins'.
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and bad way.
'How have Tories sex? "asked me a.
Each other, or the propose?
I felt as homosexuals before the more liberal legislation of the United States have felt.
I would ever be able, at Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would only after the collapse of the darkness Gleichgesinnte can take?
I should like to turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclination to suppress?
The three years, which were before me, gradually, before my intellectual eye to purgatory of the ban and isolation.
The only tutor, which is openly as a Tory, there was Norman Stone, Professor of contemporary history, its seat in my college.
He was not only to hate them, a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and for their speeches had written.
He was only rarely since.
He detested the place, it was provincial and narrow and turned him for his marxistisch-deterministische Geschichtsperspektive.
1997 was a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
'You will not be happy,' he said to me.
I began, between Oxford and the House my parents to travel, and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father, I told that I hated Oxford, and why I did.
He seemed in disbelief.
During his time in the Vierzigern all political views were accepted.
'But it is the best place in the world', said he sheepishly.
So something they would never do not, in my city of träumenden Turmspitzen.
Even my communist friends, always good manners to the day.
Marred its wet eyes.
Give the whole a chance.
I am sure that you only neckt.
I would break the heart, if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also had Tory-Anhänger, the pressures and to renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, where another Geschichtstutor seriously claimed, I was "an enemy of the people ', I decided to do the same.
Although I had secretly in shame zerging, I am a 'my parents had to undergo brainwashing', and called it 'old' stupid.
Facilitating lasted only briefly.
It was my father, of the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford-Karriere proposed.
At that time, he wrote per week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hidden me in my room after five minutes, and gave my Häscher.
As they went, grabbed I a suitcase and adopted the first move to London.
I never returned back.
Can you like to call me a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But no 18-Jährige should ever in a school in spite of such intimidation and have to suffer.
And even more tragic is that it was - an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory produced, but so far behind a windfall reputation of equality and freedom of thought in hiding.
