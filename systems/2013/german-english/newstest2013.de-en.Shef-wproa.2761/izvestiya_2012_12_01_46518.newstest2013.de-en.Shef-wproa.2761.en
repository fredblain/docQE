'The brain is so far only moderately outflank'
The supporters of modern technologies purveyors of the enlarged will become a reality in the last time for usually through the lens of a specific glasses.
Google first presented in the summer in its annual conference in November, a working model was then known that Microsoft had registered a patent.
In conversation with the head of the Group for interactive 3D-Technologien in Cambridge in Microsoft-Labor Shahram Izadi, is clear that the lens of the scientists of the company was only a Durchgangsstation.
It rewards the possibility of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and virtual Freiflächen create.
- Beschreiben you please briefly, what research your group.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the borders of this interaction.
So far largely, humanity is stuck in the phase in which to work with Pixeln Flachbildschirmen which sometimes also be affected.
However, we want vorausblicken 5-10 years and the radical changes of this interaction foreseen.
For example, are the Xbox-Konsole and the Kinect-Sensoren a step forward, and today will no longer be sold without Kinect Xbox, as all for movement.
- What we are still in the future?
- Although Kinect the interaction of a physical level, is playing a great deal still on the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D.
The submission of information (the system more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We are trying to change that are working on genuine three-dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We must dismiss Computerwelt in our physical world and make it comprehensible.
It is required, however, that it is not only the users, but also its surroundings, will be recognised.
We could then the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first and foremost, we should be rid of these bescheuerten Virtual-Reality-Helme!
- What do you think about Sprachsteuerung?
It is popular, but will they not?
- you is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because we do not always all others, on its actions and intentions would like to inform.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers good, however, each in their certain niche.
For example, we in the field of governance of objects, in public places in a project in which we have with short and scarce, rather than with sprawling gestures experimentierten.
The gestures not by the Objektkamera, but by a bracelet recorded the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
It is still relatively large, could in theory, however, to the size of a wristwatch be narrowed.
But as a whole, however, is the future, for example, mixed Steuerungstypen Gestik and language.
- How this?
- We would you ask me, for example, to you this Sprudeldose rich?
They say it and to suggest at the same time.
Normally I say it simply.
- oh, that would be very difficult to see.
This means that you want to - that the users adapt to it, what a machine can make the relevant time, and what does not?
- It is not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we in the next time, especially in the development of new types of work will need to make it possible reactions of people in more detail.
This can be Lasersensoren for example in depth, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
- What demands you on the basis of your work with the Xbox Kinect-Sensoren to modern cameras?
There is a lack of disintegration, or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of the three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 Megapixel with a rate of 1 000 fps not bad.
However, the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In view of all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must not only the unraveling along the girl and XY the Y-, but also along the Z-Achse be taken into account.
The speed and the number of the images per second are important.
The movements of people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, are the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a Berührungssensor with a regulierbaren Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1% to 100 of milli-seconds for, with today ’ s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 and 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I was just such a device, only without Berührungssteuerung and with more images per second.
- the number of the cameras Müsste not be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three 'cameras', with one of them actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of this is reflected signal.
And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-Kamera.
It is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe.
Perhaps more cameras could solve the problem...
Or the problem, because more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice Kinect-ähnliches a flexible system where we could play with various Kameraneigungen to see how we in the three-dimensional identifying a position.
- if I remember correctly, Google, Microsoft in contrast to his glasses not the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not always pleasant, on a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: the tollste formula would be a 'rotating' enlarged reality, in which we have a cloud of the impact on the smart phone could tune
The lens is a personal 'gadget' and is its strength (private only you can see), but at the same time its weakness, because an enlarged reality through the lens prevented that you, together with others to virtual objects able to work.
- Let us a moment that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air not only Mr Stark from Iron Man, but also human beings.
There is a problem, to the critics often out of this idea: there is no tangible response.
The hands of feel nothing!
What answers to your group on this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk of the fact that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the taktilen perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.
It takes pressure excellent true!
But there are also actually technologies, which are geared to the 'images in the air' to give something concrete, for example, the collision of some Ultraschallstrahlen addressed in a certain point, where the finger, a sense, but at the moment is so weak, as someone on the Handballen pustete.
There are also bands for the Commission on the nerve endings detect tissue injury in the fingers, that is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to the brain to outflank?
It think that it can feel that what it should, if it is just something?
- That is a good idea, as we have not yet been tried.
Here lies another task to which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a person physically in a closed area, to believe that it is instead in an open, virtually endless area; we are working on concepts with Laufbändern (other than in Fitnessstudios), mobile platforms and large bullets.
So far is only moderately outflank the brain, and we still have many hard work for years.
It is precisely this makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers thus attractive: many issues we are only at the start.
