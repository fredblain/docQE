Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be unexpected cornerstone for the peace
Is it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blame countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and killed six Israelis - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli city in Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians trapped in their historic conflict seems, is changing the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the lethal stalemate could at last find its end.
A war that is not yet lost
At first glance, optimism, given the current situation anything other than appropriate.
Even if the on 21 November agreed cease-fire lasts, the week's fighting the tough-minded on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement, which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis to have reduced, even though his group has even large losses.
Although some of the leaders and killed 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel until now, have not managed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, the Hamas in the West Bank, which of the rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah is controlled.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that the time they have on their side.
So, as Islamists in the Arab world to have influence, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends can draw on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, the once as Israel ’ s closest Muslim ally has taken for Hamas Party - like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Cheerful Hamas-Anhänger believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power on Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren stamp before the Stürzung Bashar ’ s, to Jordan, where Hamas-Verbündete the King.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - far and away the einwohnerstärksten and most important Arab country - from the southern flank of Israel has greatly altered the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular tyrant, Egypt, until his fall 2011 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders more dependent on Volksansichten.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove to be the Hamas as a player, even by Israel and the United States are not excluded.
Israeli hardliners, however, let the opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no risk more.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome ', has to prove and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will can sleep more easily.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in its position. Many European countries have the Hamas Gewalteskalationen made responsible for the latest.
Israel is there in recent years is good, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, of the peace process has largely ignored.
Although rockets from Gaza since 2004, around 30 Israelis have killed, is the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the security wall has, in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. This protect hineinverlaufen the Jewish settlements, which is to have been declared illegal under international law, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu is good because. His Likud Party has in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, with a more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, allied kämpferischeren group.
Why these hinterlistigen Palestinians and a nanny state of their own devices?
If they actually the control of the West Bank, they would then have not just as their allies in Gaza also firing of rockets?
No, it is better to have them behind the wall at bay and punish, they should dare to the heads.
Perhaps it will be able to enforce the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could offer them a case of.
Even if the Islamists, who now in Egypt and in other countries are little for Israel, they will begin with the difficulties in their own country.
The taken by Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower the new Arab governments will hardly help in the restoration of their economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust to achieve a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Even Israelis should long-term thinking.
While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which is undoubtedly one day in the Israeli occupied territories will explode, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv to explode.
The repression undermines already the democracy of the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Bloody missions for the eradication of the Hamas in Gaza over the years of increasingly its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a boost from outside
The right answer is that which the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two states, in which Israel's security areas.
The small - for the near future - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar stop the flow of arms in the Gaza Strip and is better placed than ever before, the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a common Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also the Hamas and Fatah move to an agreement.
That would be more to the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the forthcoming request for UN-Beobachterstatus.
Obama must also play its part, Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he failed to the presentation of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is as a participation reluctant.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
