In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-jährige Community College-Student and footballers Anthony Orozco is in the south-east Colorados for a crime to justice in this state, which soon will be legally: the possession of some less Marihuanabrocken and a tune with which he these rauchte.
Orozco, he and some friends in a Septembertag with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas, as they were stopped.
After the police officers marijuana, was found in the car Orozco for the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien appear - Kavaliersdelikte, each with a fine of $100 is - and has received a court hearing.
'We are being treated like criminals', so Orozco.
But it is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities of marijuana to legalise the case, the answer depends in hundreds of smaller takes less by law, as the site.
Hundreds of minor in marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the similar measures approved, has already dropped.
The police authorities pursue 21 years no longer for property in a small scale. This is legally permitted, once the new laws in the next few weeks to come into force.
But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced, existing Marihuanadelikte people are still pursuing and quote in court.
At the same time, several cities vote in favour of the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains, and new, state licensed Marihuanageschäfte to the opening in their communities.
'This situation is developing so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next,' says Mr J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, the East of Denver.
Regulators and also in the state of Washington scratch are perplexed at the head.
They are waiting for a guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of drugs - and we have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington is one of the view that Colorado in any case, the majority of States is what the regulation of marijuana. There was the drug only for medical purposes, and then Eigenkonsum legalised.
'Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore good for the orientation', says Mr E. Smith, the spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also that there is no place or system can do more, as in terms of gross guide to serve.
'We have no real precedent, which we can follow', he adds.
The Washington law called I-502, on 6 December in force and is thus also the conclusion of a grey area in which the State licensing system is not yet exist, but the possession has legalised.
And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be clarified - in this time around, as the state imposition of a 'fair access' lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften around 300 metres in schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.
'nowhere more difficult, it will be a location for to find a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in Seattle Ballungsgebiet', says Ben Livingston, the spokesperson for the 'Center for Legal cannabis', a group of scholars recently formed.

Chief Oates added that the police to urban guidelines for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana will prevail and drug traffickers continue to be pursued.
In the north County Weld Colorados represents Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he gave to his authority would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly in order to persuade consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently must 119 people for the possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana trial, although many also for other offences have been charged.
'Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements, where the crime was' Tatzeitpunkt buck, in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana-Initiative ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of Landkreises shows adults, for the possession of small quantities no longer.
Bezirksstaatsanwalt Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided to add, however, not all outstanding Besitzverfahren fall.
'I do not believe that I think that wastes time, to enforce the law, to change', he says.
While 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure was already clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.

In Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it is a 'cultural barrier,' says Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver, the Court for Marihuanadelikte the defendants, and on the ground as spokesperson for the national organisation on the reform of Marihuanagesetzen operates.

Advocates of Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the Justice Ministry is going to give in.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas the Federal Government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to the majority.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik-Berater the Obama administration is the view that law are probably no doors, in order to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but presumably resist that, under the new legislation legal, publicly regulated Marihuana-Geschäfte to tolerate.
Many towns in Colorado not wait for the fact that the federal authorities act.
Before the election day approved some local municipalities moratoria on new Marihuana-Geschäfte, although this only in a year could open up.
Montrose decided last week, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
'We do not want in a position where we license someone at the federal level and then have a huge problem', as Bob Nicholson, a Member of the Council.
Our Community has voted against this amendment.
We then, for what the Community has decided and not afterwards, for what the state has decided.
There are still many questions unanswered.
