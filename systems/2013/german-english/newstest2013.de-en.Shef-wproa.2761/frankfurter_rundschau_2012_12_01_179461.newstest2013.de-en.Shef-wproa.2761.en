AIDS Day and sing help:
In Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi - and in Swaziland, children orphaned by AIDS.
The history of a link, the far more than 8733 kilometres.
First the us making all this noise: Cowboystiefel, Basketballschuhe Damenpumps Herrenslipper, and look to the Parkettboden find the pace, it quickly.
Eins-zwei-drei-vier.
Only then thresholds the voices of the singer slowly - old, utterly, tone and Sopran - press, and pursue betören.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old a conductor, it almost from his Stoffschuhen, if it brings together with his elastic wild gestures.
It is on Monday evening, in the Musikraum of the Institute for Medizinische psychology in Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi a new song.
In the fifty Sängerinnen and singer arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, of the Humangenetikerin until the householder.
'Om' Obani 'is not a simple way, every Chorstimme has a different text and this also in a foreign language: ethnic Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
In the world, there are around 34 million people infected with HIV, the estimates UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations to Bekämfung of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland live 245000 children orphaned by AIDS.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 children orphaned by AIDS in the village Esitjeni, the club Voices for Africa godfathers found in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, we can take a sponsor.
It guarantees the child Schuluniform school fees, and every day in the warm meals Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means to ethnic Zulu Geschichtenerzähler or Lobpreiser.
The fluid Bantusprache can speak in this area, but no one.
For almost ten years, the chorus of songs in this foreign soft language and brings them from time to go back to where they originally come from: in the South Africa.
As the crow flies 8 733 kilometres of Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that the voting power of the German Chores depends.
Forty per cent are infected
Approximately 2 000 people live there, some still in simple Lehm- and Strohhütten, a large proportion of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents more, because these are the HIV resistance.
In Esitjeni is reflected in the small, which is suffering from quite Swaziland: high HIV-Infektionsrate, lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Restrictions on the male Vorhaut, the risk of contagion demonstrably by half, will reduce the population of barely adopted.
More than forty per cent of people in Swaziland bear the Immunschwäche-Virus, with the middle of thirty to die is not uncommon.
In a common Afrika-Reise in the spring of 2005, the chorus of the village, but above all saw the Imbongis many children on the roads, which not only to parental responsibility, but simply to all: food, clothing, education.
School without qualifications in a poor country has certainly not a chance.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros in the year a child to school and to send him a warm meal a day.
But was already a year later, the chorus of the club 'Voices for Africa', since almost professional the Aids-Waisen in Esitjeni.
Facts to sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually-transmitted diseases?
To the bacterial STI, count syphilis chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI, HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzläuse and Krätze are among the parasite TSIs.
Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen?
Tripper syphilis and, above all, in men, the sex with men.
The Robert-Koch-Institut assumes that at least four out of five of all in Germany notified Syphilis-Fälle through sexual contact between men.
In the heterosexual adults are Chlamydien-Infektionen, Trichomonaden, Candidose (fungus), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren often occurring sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is comparatively small adults under heterosexual here, however: around 20% of the new to this group.
Among young people are Chlamydien-Infektionen much more frequent than in other groups.
After European surveys relate to three quarters of infections young people between 15 and 25 years.
Here, also come Humane Pappilomaviren in young people often.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.
The number of Syphilis-Infektionen, according to the Robert-Koch-Institut of 1697 diseases 3698 diseases in 2001 to more than doubled in the year 2011.
The number of new, since 2007.
2011, there were around 2 700 cases.
This is about a tenth of less than in the year before.
What symptoms point to a contract?
Infectious diseases can ulcers in Genitalbereich, complaints to the, a product, and urinate Unterbauchschmerzen Bläschen or Warzen.
Often, however, they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect itself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion to offer protection, but not a 100%.
Because, in part, can cause of sexually transmitted diseases also by Schmierinfektionen and close just be passed on.
Therefore recommend experts in particular often changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups.
Early diagnosed STI the majority can be cured and have avoided.
By godmothers, donations and not least the Gagen, the chorus throughout Germany ersingt, is a great deal together.
'All in all, we have already around EUR 200 000 sent after Esitjeni,' says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the associations.
In the village Zodwa Dlamini even managed, a self-confident and durchsetzungsstarke Mrs, the money from Germany.
It is also looking to ensure that the orphans, in a particularly good example of the Grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women on ethnic Zulu CITES are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in, giving them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day to schooling appear on time.
Anyone who has more to come into Schutzhaus Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club, as well as the two cooks, every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, 'Voices for Africa' a Nähschule launched two Hühnerhäuser built and together with the American health arrangements PSI organised, that many in the village a HIV-Test have.
This is not a matter of course, because obviously the disease in the whole country is, it remains silent they prefer dead.
A king with 14 wives
'AIDS is an absolute taboo Annette Lennartz,' says, 'because it has to do with sexuality.'
Strange in a country in which the King officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch King Mswati III, sub-Saharan Africa, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state sanctioned way of life that the HIV in the last few decades has spread so quickly.
But also the many migrant workers, the virus around the country.
There would be free of condoms in every corner, Annette Lennartz says, 'but which are hardly being used.
Culture is a different - flesh to flesh '.
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the two, three years Imbongi-Chor all jointly by the South Africa and singing songs of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, the many on the southern bit of the black continent even in times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in a black language - as much recognition is not only mood and pleasure, but has also been some grim border guards a few tears abgetrotzt.
The journey will always lead to Esitjeni, where the singer their godchildren visit.
Even though the small village on maps, little will take place in the valley of Ezulweni-Flusses it is more than known.
'Is after Esitjeni, as is the light' say the people there.
And if we consider the crow flies 8733 kilometres for Heidelberg return to the stampfenden singers in the Proberaum Bergheimer in the street, then we see it as well.
