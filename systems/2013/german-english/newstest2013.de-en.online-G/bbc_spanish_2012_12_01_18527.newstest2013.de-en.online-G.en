This is something just for the Internet, which is why we had it funny and fun to make.
It is the biggest Problem in this country.
In Breeding we are the Worst in the world, therefore, we realized that it is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government is much had tried as such. As the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of Speed Dating evenings (fast flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, they led, but not necessarily to success.
Therefore, we thought: Why don't we make something as creative as possible in order to address this Problem, as such. As a Rap to compose?
1,2 children
Who is this topic is not easy to take, is the Singapore government.
Every year you at 1,300 US dollars for political measures, in order the citizens to encourage more children to get.
A package of the government for married couples and parents grants of up to $ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, leading high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also for the conservatism of its Rulers and its strict social controls is known.
In accordance with its national Bevölkerungsbehörde, the fertility rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last Time the Rate on 2 - fraud-which is also the Ersetzungsrate is known - was in the year of 1976.
So why get Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the marriage and family policy of the national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this is a "better education" and "greater career opportunities", was due.
"This has the people, except to marry and to found a family, to form far more options in terms of goals in life to have and to set priorities," she explains.
These Changes in the social conditions have contributed to the higher number of Single adults, and the Delay of marriage and births contributed, which will result in the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, introduced an immigration policy to a sharp increase in immigration is aimed to the reduction of the population, to feelings of resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants blooms, particularly against the Chinese people to be criticized for that you keep wages low and do not integrate.
The increase in Immigration is also considered as one of the reasons considered that the ruling party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since the independence achieved.
Since the elections, an attempt was made, the Problem with higher contributions and dues for foreign workers to be correct.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate, the well-known effects on the economic growth of a Nation, the tax revenues, the cost of healthcare and immigration policy, demonstrated by the example of Singapore also have unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve, that not so many small apartments to be built.
So she already has also impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun, the number of small apartments to control, as the "shoeboxes" are well known and in certain areas of the city can be built.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters, and show a major success.
However, there is concern that the Lifestyle of the Single can promote, and that the construction companies deter large apartment for families to build.
But Lim Yew Soon, General Director of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoeboxes" much faster than larger units to sell.
They are so popular, and the units are to days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger units.
This means that for our Cash Flow much better.
He is, however, that the new standards developers clearer guidance, which previously obstacles put in the way, if you have too many small units in a project to build.
Too much Stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules, the way to increase the national birth rate could cause, the discussions with the Singapurern, the financial work, see that you do not have great impact.
"The people who are severely stressed the apartments and the education is expensive, which is why many delayed" says a young Manager.
The children can get another.
"For me it is important to use my own money and time to come," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women perform their career, the Stress and the cost of the property and the education as the reasons why you have no children.
That is why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to children - because the government can still do so much.
