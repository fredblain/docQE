Cause of death due to Aids is now too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the examination results confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the Moment in which he is the diagnosis is received, the doctor without noticeable success "mitigate tried".
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided alone to his illness to take care of and started to inform about it; and this, with such use, that he was in his 43. Birthday celebrated.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he after several Fights in 1994.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 90s was hard to imagine, as there are many doubt, a few treatment options, and more Stigmata were.
At that time, avoided even the Director of a clinic of the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it's a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible that this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.
However, still many people in the hospital, none of their disease knowledge, and where the Virus is already harm and your immune system is exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the Appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e., after the Occurrence of the first reported cases, "means the great success it is today, that the Survival of a patient, the treatment takes time, and the Survival of the General population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that this Information is in April of this year from a reputable scientific publication have been supported.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the year 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the year of Survival and the quality of life of the degree of impairment of the immune system of the persons at the beginning of the treatment stake, and that the greater the chance they have not drug addicts: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the meaning of the above, that, who at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of being HIV-positive, in this sense, "easily 75 years old can be, as long as he is under control," said this professional.
To this progress classified correctly, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today, an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in the past few years, significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in the year 2011 (the annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), it is nevertheless true that since the advent of the AIDS 60 percent of the national database collected patients have died.
Alone in the state of Jalisco died in the year 2011 255 people, and until the month of may of this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured, that since 2005 universal access to the antiretroviral medicines.
- Why die so still people in it?
- In my opinion, is not the Problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no supply problems with drugs. The Problem is, that the people in far advanced state to come, because your Infektionszustand not know, i.e. in the very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an accompanying infection. To the global mortality influence, are to earlier diagnoses required, which is why all persons, where this is required, massive detection tests, must be provided."
This proposal agree with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevenci√≥n del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state Committee for AIDS prevention in the state of Jalisco), and also the patients as Fabrizio to its Test at a private laboratory to perform for him, and this for the simple reason, because it is a friend of him had made, in spite of his young age already in the AIDS Phase was, and even the Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous Tumor) had, which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you AIDS have.
Some think that they are going to die, and want to hear nothing.
"If I must die, rather then three Times burst", as you say in my case.
The Change was to towards improvement, I eat well, exercise, and take the medicines.
Today, to know his parents, that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I do a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the health of the other Person", is one of Fabrizio, which agreed to its intimate Details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony those to animate, today, in the framework of the world AIDS day to be afraid.
You should do the Test, if you are in the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV-positive are, the better, and if the diagnosis already know, you should learn how to be like all the people responsible life.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the programmes and the simple citizen, there are large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, a Journalist from Guadalajara, the matter of HIV has been accepted.
And the most Important is the prevention.
At the certain places "was the distribution of condoms actually increased; previously they were individually released, now give us packages with one hundred pieces, what is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
To the people at risk for new infections include the young people.
"Why do you need it?" is a common Spottfrage of social workers, Orientierungspersonal in schools, employees in pharmacies and the health care system, the young people do not want to be exposed to, assured the correspondent.
He suggested this inefficient distribution to re-Orient; the condoms should not only behind the counter, but rather in output devices in a public toilet facilities, which are often of young people to be visited.
It should not encourage promiscuity.
It should not give them the beer and Motel be paid, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez on the question and replied, whether under his administration condoms will be distributed.
"Sexuality looks not so; it is Best that condoms those to bring them closer to that already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
