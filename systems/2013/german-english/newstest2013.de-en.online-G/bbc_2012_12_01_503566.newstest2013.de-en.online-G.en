Rakfisk from Norway: this Is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country's something with the local appetite for quite smelly fish have to do?
Take a selection of over ripe cheeses.
One place you in the midst of a pile of dirty, humid sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
So about you nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk imagine, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo airport.
There is snow, spectacular scenery and these persistent smell in the air that just will not go away.
Rakfisk is with salt gritted trout, which - depending on how smelly his fish would like - up to a year in water is fermented.
If in Norway the darkness of the Land and the weather becomes colder, currents Norwegians to a Festival here in Fagernes, the this, now, is really very impressive specialty is dedicated.
"You have to eat it raw, and rinse it with a glass of Aquavit down," says Havard Halvarsen, which is actually in the local fire station is working, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General of the Festival.
Around us people consume small Fischwürfel and take this large amounts of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The Spirit can smell displace.
I taste some appetizers.
If one is to avoid the Rakfisk in Nasennähe to bring, he is not bad - such as Sushi, which quite a long bus ride behind.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no refrigeration, gave and fish in the autumn in airtight Salzwasserfässern was soaked.
In the dead of Winter, he was then, after a long fermentation removed and will no doubt use of alcohol muted senses consumed.
Even a Generation ago, saw thousands of Norwegians on the search for work, forced to leave their country and emigrated, mainly to the USA.
Today's population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not too long time ago, far richer was as Norway, streams of immigrants.
Rakfisk is as something Important regarded as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy.
But actually it is here, Yes everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a Sandwich costs proud of 10 euros.
Norway does not create it often in the world media, and most people don't seem to bother you.
Here hates you have it still, Different Breivik to call it by name - those racist right-wing extremists, the last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, one refers only to the "incident of 22. July".
Norwegians do difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country to such a brutal murder is capable of.
The main reason for the today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest Oil - and Gasindustrien the world.
"But Oil is not the only reason why it is so good to us," says Anna, our waitress, round tablet with Mature Rakfisk is distributed, and with her long blonde hair, and piercing blue eyes the Nordic Ideal is embodied.
We are a - how to say - prudent people.
Your English is just like that of most people here spotless.
We are not very pretentious, we don't like bragging.
Norway is using his oil wealth to be very carefully handled - a large part of the Branchenerträge is for the benefit of future generations in a special Fund invests.
As in the years up to the world economic crisis all the money around threw that you do not possessed, held Norway his purse tightly closed.
"As long as, in Winter we go skiing and in summer Hiking can go, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk food", adds them with light-hearted Laughter.
I stand in the snow and put me on another court - by Rakfisk I have enough.
So a moose Burger is definitely something else. The succulent flesh next to me.
But in the evening it is time again for the Stinkefisch on the menu.
The Hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several venues, a Rakfisk Dinner organize for the guests for the best - or perhaps the Geruchssinne the most challenging - fish can vote.
There is a Live-TV-circuit to a Fly-clad host, the plates with Rakfisk is surrounded.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You clapping and laughing.
A man falls out of his chair, possibly from the Aquavit overwhelmed.
But maybe it is the strict haze of the whole fish.
