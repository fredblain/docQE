"Trademark" in China: If Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese are
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is based on a China officially registered name, however, nothing to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen has to do.
Nevertheless, it enjoys as long protection, such as the actual namesake't complain.
And even then, it is not clear whether they will get justice.
"It is for foreigners are always more difficult, their brands in China to protect", says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney with the law firm Taylor Wessing, on rights in the far East is specialized.
Each week, lands a new case on my Desk.
The imitators enough to have seen a few extra letters, so that their brands are allowed to log.
So, from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada makes you Prada-Kny enter.
German companies also in this way are legal copies, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark office in Beijing.
On 14. September 2010, let there be a Chinese company, the trademark Zegna DF Puma protect a name, which is also the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna served.
The fact that the Chinese world champion in the Copy, and in the infringed intellectual property, is well known.
In the large cities, there are multi-storey Department stores, which are almost exclusively sell fakes.
Pattlochs cases, but are different: on behalf of his clients, he goes on the other hand, that Chinese companies by the trademark office officially received the right to a name, to use the already elsewhere is protected.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a Beifahrermarke.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
Thus, women are meant, which is rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are aware no one to blame
"This is bad for business, you have to overcome it", calls Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the unique position disappears, the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the proceedings of the affected sectors are in the millions, especially in the case of expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the market research company CLSA's China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third-largest market for luxury goods and the fastest-growing.
However, deletions dubious entries in the register of marks are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
Up to nine years is the method to last, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court abwies, because of the long duration of the disputed Name to the "market reality".
If the plaintiff bad luck, he must have the plagiarist even have to pay money, because he is its brand in China injured, says Pattloch.
Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern the graphical elements.
2009, Daimler has a dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister took over.
The Chinese may, therefore, is today an Emblem to use the Mercedes star is similar.
The Volvo buyers Geely used originally a blue-and-white Logo, the BMW remembered; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion brand Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction could.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any guilt.
The trademark office CTMO in Beijing that it there in 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment of the rooms bottlenecks have given.
In the past year was, however, one of the "emergency situation in the workflow returned to normal".
So, the stock of raw, unprocessed opposition to 22 per cent.
Almost 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, waiting in the office still 81.500 objections to completion.
Address costs a lot
As so often in China the Figures are impressive.
In the past year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, which is almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China, for the tenth Time in a row, the list of the registrations all over the world, giving the authority will notify with.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
2011 would be 1.8 billion Yuan in fees had been taken.
Simplified means that each application on average, 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
Address costing many multiples, such as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years of fighting, the group against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans could reach that his illegal manufacture of imitation auto parts was dug.
But secured the imitators continue to the Chinese rights to the mark Freudenberg.
You yourself have failed, because in Germany surname is not protected and could be said Hanno Wentzler, the Chairman of the Board of management of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO dismissed the objection of the Munich because even back.
In the next two instances got Freudenberg right, but the opposing party is fighting until today.
You must be extremely careful
Now is the matter before the Supreme court of justice.
Wentzler is confident that the thing to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and it cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were almost impossible to quantify, the company archives have even one hundred years old files browse need to proof.
Five years ago bot Freudenberg the other side, in vain, a "high six-figure amount in euros" for the settlement.
"Because you can see how much the value is", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the far East, threatening even to Europe zur√ºckzuschwappen.
Then, if there's imitators, unprotected brands secure.
So wanted a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, the term Freudenberg for shoes and leather log on.
This area of business, the group has been abandoned long ago, yet he was able registration to turn away.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the attorney Pattloch rates German companies do business with China very careful.
It is not rich, international trademark rights to leave, rather, should the foreigner "everything that is somehow worthy of protection, even in China, sign in", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the much more expensive than the registry.
In fact: If Freudenberg in the last act of his Markendramas subject, then you would have probably the opposite side of royalties for the own names, numbers, explains Wentzler.
Or we are in the Segment of the market.
