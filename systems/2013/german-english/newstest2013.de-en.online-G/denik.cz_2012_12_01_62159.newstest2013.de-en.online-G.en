Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to positive energy collect
What do you think about that in less than a month of the end of the world is supposed to take place?
This is one of those disaster reports, on which we humans are so happy to pounce.
With our Band The Tap Tap to make us more about fun and say that we are the only Band in the world are enough positive energy can use to collect the end of the world to stop or prevent.
In December realize there is also a unique project, with three concerts against the end of the world.
You can get to our readers the project closer to imagine?
It is a national charity, we have already been two years in the planning.
For this, we want the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar to use, the end for the 21. December at 11:10 am in the morning forecast.
The day before, i.e. on 20. December, find from 21:00 o'clock at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be in approximately the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone to 12 hours before us is that the Mayan calendar ends.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally from me, then we have the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta developed.
Here, we would not only sufficient positive energy, to collect the end of the world to prevent, but we also want to be together with the Public think about it, the condition in which this world once our children to pass.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have a unique collection of shoes, T-Shirts, bags and key fobs against the end of the world to be developed, with their purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people also can support.
The Band the Tap Tap, together with other artists also the so-called. Anthem against the end of the world with the title "end of the world falls out."
Today is the anthem on YouTube is very popular. It is also to the benefit concerts, resound?
Of course, in the very end, assuming that all goes well and the doomsday will not take place...
The anthem is supposed to be from all of the performers on all three concerts at the same time, are sung.
In addition, the hymns together in a direct circuitry by the Czech television broadcast live.
The Text of the anthem comes from Tomas by HANAK, who is also the main character of Jesus in the video clip is playing, also Xindl X sings with...
How are they to the cooperation with the two of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which related to the fact that we have many Fund-raising events and concerts...
We strive to keep these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown, that the majority of working with us are interested, and have some fun with it.
What is the purpose of coming to the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world benefit from this?
For the establishment of a barrier-free educational centre Studeo, we had been six years, together with the Association Tap in the Jedlička Institute work.
The students of the Jedlička Institute regularly editors looked after them in different activities to help.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to the editors to visit, we want to give you this way to help.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is supposed to be a private building, in which we then use this project to move in.
At each concert will encounter several groups and performers.
According to what criteria have you chosen?
We wanted a program to compile all generations, including children appeals.
In Prague occur, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiri Suchy.
All the details are on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" is also planned for the future?
In may, we get for the first Time during the Prague spring, and also for this concert, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to be in the Czech house in New York occur, and I personally, as if we had time, in the USA - this would also be happy with performances in Washington and Chicago connect.
Their plans abroad are not just small, so far, they are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow occurred.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities is composed of.
How do they cope with this travel logistically and organizationally?
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs need to be transported in the Luggage compartment. In addition, we must, of course, many an instrument case and other Luggage to lug around...
Nevertheless, so far it has always worked without problems, CSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I am sometimes, sometimes even surprised me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently, there were no problems.
Through their travel abroad, you will have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility looks like, how to get there, people with disabilities, deals, etc.
As you have these things been experiencing?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, in which everything works better than us, we were just in Russia witness that in the East, everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for the disabled. There it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre is on the way.
It is not even, of course, that you can use a wheelchair, for example, in the Elevator vorlässt.
Fortunately also arise there, clubs, trying, on the problems of people with disabilities should be noted.
And in what respect we must compared to the more developed countries catch up?
There are many things in which we hang behind...
But still, it should be noted that an improvement of the Situation always depends on the Efforts of the parties Concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is very common that people with severe disabilities independently in the public space to move, go to the Museum, toilets can use, etc.
But it is not common that there is a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in the social events involved, we're with the Band The Tap Tap the West a little ahead!
Respect in the Public and accessibility is one thing, but only if from our ranks significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, are things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. If we have but a few years back: What was in the year 1998 motivated to start a Band?
At that time I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I have a lot of young people met who were interested in, and with a little intense.
And since I myself am a musician and others. Saxophone games, I, together with a colleague, a music-AG was founded.
Well, and with the time it is like our Moderator, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say, a bit out of control (laughs).
Became known the Band, but only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that for us to cooperate with well-known singers has helped; in addition, we have also started to actively for us to advertise.
We are aware that, if you are doing anything, and this is outward is not visible, the own performance, in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding can we also good editors, high-quality equipment and etc afford.
Their aim was it with The Tap Tap so far as to bring?
From the outset I have the Potential felt that one way of doing things.
In show business, copies today often one to the other.
This is on his way, logically, since everything New considered with caution and only after some time will be accepted.
There are only a few of the really unique things, and I would venture to say that Tap Tap.
The first impression of the audience usually has, of course, is pity; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings, we regret to have to.
There are people who have a full life to live and to develop, if you have the necessary funds.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only for itself a step forward, but for the whole society.
It was for this success is also helpful that you have a strict boss, how many people listen to?
If you do something good, want to make, you may in many things not compromise and must also have a certain discipline in demand.
This is, in my opinion, but it is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you then find that you twice a week sample preparatory stages must complete and a lot of time on concert tours to spend, then turns off the enthusiasm of many fast.
So it works but everywhere, in each Band, the work seriously and want to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap twenty members.
How many of them were from the very beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. This can't be prevented.
Those who have the will and the desire to Join with us is always welcome.
