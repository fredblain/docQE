Own taste in lieu of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is implementing the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", the citizens is dedicated to the avant-garde of culture and art form.
On the select list landed already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, the success of which is beyond the borders of the city, and often recognition in Europe, not in the Rest of Russia to be known.
The new Hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the Red-clad Bearded, once at the Russian Museum, once during the summer garden, times at the scene or on exhibitions there.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller also be issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socially-philosophical artists, the new myths created.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s, respectively. At the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and conjures up by his presence on the road to his fellow citizens a Smile on your face and provide you a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel-organ, and became the Petersburg street organ players, since it is for this challenging role with regard to his KÃ¼nstlerdasein, his philosophy, and his Image, we are finally ready felt.
- Kirill, why are you always in Red and not, for example, in Yellow and turquoise in the city on the road?
I have the color Red as a fashion designer, with the look and Image of deals.
In this world, Red is the compromise between the artist, image consultants and society.
In the society gets everything, what some of the Graunorm differs, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want by my provocations with the people into the conversation.
Each of my recent provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know that you are a painter need to be?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of culture, in my Works were displayed.
I realized that I go this way.
Then was the time of the ancient free, however, not officially recognized painter at that time to the end, and the new and free painters like I were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new Generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; this resulted in "Pushkinskaya 10", and then was once an end.
It takes me to a theatre, fashion, music, actually, to all, except the literature.
And all this is United in your Art-clinic... - It was important to me, in the center of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists congregate.
In the year 1995 hour I a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovation of a musical-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the St. Petersburg Boheme.
Many of them were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember, like a cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs to the Play-back, wearing tight shirts and among them was also the now fashionable composer Igor Wdowin.
As the group began to play live, was out of it "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of the "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and there began his great career, but the principles he learned in the us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art clinic.
Went there for our staff and regulars.
I am a Hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there were in the press survey, when it comes to the award of "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "artist of the year", and so I was at the peak reached.
It is not easy, in the new times, according to old rules to work; I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
At the present time, it is easy to be famous, but the culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous, without a cultural contribution.
Your Works have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring clearly the timeliness and clarity of the thoughts expressed.
I'm going to an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be that way.
In a Clown blurred all and loses its tragedy.
I love the Grotesque, and I've grotesque ideas.
We save, for example, the world, we require that each fully to dress up.
Now pays each on the clothes and is based on the Outer and the Inner of the people.
But perhaps you may a people not to shake the Hand, but he should spit in the face.
The illusion disappears through the Dress.
- Recently we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - A city of culture should be as a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can also commercial art to be beautiful?
- These days, commercial art, careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of the cultures.
Earlier, formed the people of big groups: The Bohemians loved the One and the simple people of the Other.
Now, there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not one hundred-dollars-Note that appeals to everybody.
Now you need to consider who you like will.
Now everyone has cult star about 100 followers.
- The performances of the Stas Mikhailov come but several Thousand!
- To come to him deserted women, plays in the sexually-social sphere a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 persons and 10 Thousand, consequently, there are fewer Management, money, and all perish.
I have the trailer, and the most Important thing is for you not to cheat and Reached not to destroy it.
In my youth I used these pictures to be painted, the case of a collector, even in a row with the works by Falk and Larionov hung.
I began with images normally only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture, and culture.
Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with the artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money refused to paint.
This is the culture I am advocating.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- Good Culture Experts.
One says: servant of the culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Tsar was different, because the Tsar understood may not be much of a culture, but they understood that the right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good adviser.
In St. Petersburg we have what, the experts could be, but you, the way is blocked, because it hochrangigerer experts demand that the Former properly evaluate them and clear the way.
Now it is only your own taste.
The same is true for the Erarta, however, with the difference that you honestly say that you are not all contemporary art accept and some painters therefore, other museums have to search.
- What is available for you to Petersburg?
Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow, there are much more culture and a suitable breeding ground.
On our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural soil, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is still not right.
In Europe there are many curious people, exhibitions or concerts.
In the us are much less.
Art must again be modern, as well as to the beginning of the last century.
The project is from grants of the city of Saint Petersburg financed
