"The brain can so far only moderately outwit"
The followers of modern technologies popular topic of augmented reality in the last time, usually through the lens of a special glasses perceived.
First presented to Google in the summer at its annual conference will be a working model, in November was then announced that Microsoft also a corresponding Patent had logged in.
In an interview with the head of the group for interactive 3D-technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is apparent, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company's only a way station was.
You are intrigued by the possibility of virtual objects into the air with his bare hands to manipulate and virtual spaces to create.
- Please describe briefly the research your group operates.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, with the aim, however, the limitations of this interaction expand.
So far, mankind is mostly in the Phase stuck in with the pixels on the flat screens working, sometimes also to be touched.
However, we want to 5-10 years of vorausblicken and the radical changes in this interaction to predict.
For example, the Xbox console and the Xbox Sensors progress, and today is no Xbox without Kinect sold, since all for motion control are interested in.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect the interaction on a physical level, plays a lot of things on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the System receives more data) could be improved, the output is not yet critical.
We try to change, work on real three-dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We have the world in our physical world are discharged and they are comprehensible.
For this purpose it is necessary that not only the users, but also its environment is detected.
Then we could the real world much easier by virtual objects Supplement.
And, first of all, we should be this stupid Virtual Reality helmets to get rid of!
- What do you think about voice control?
It is popular, but it is not overrated?
- It is certainly not the Allzweckl√∂sung, since you have questions about the privacy issues, because you are not getting any bystanders about his actions and intentions would like to inform.
In fact any kind of interaction with computers is good, however, each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects in public places in a project in which we have a short and concise, instead of sweeping Gestures experimented.
The Gestures are not of the Objektkamera, but from a bracelet recorded the movements of the muscles and bones registered.
It is still relatively large, could, in theory, however, on the size of a wristwatch be reduced.
But overall, the future belongs to, however, mixed types of controls, for example, Gestures, and language.
- How come?
- We would me ask you this Sprudeldose to be rich?
You say it and point at the same time.
- Usually I say it simply.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
- Does that mean you want that the user can log on to the contours of what a machine at any given time can afford and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we will in the next time, especially on the development of new types of sensors work will need to allow for the reactions of people to more accurately capture.
This can, for example, laser sensors, as in the depth of a good resolution offer, which is very important.
- What are the demands set on the basis of their work with the Xbox Xbox Sensors in modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
- The current Generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, would be 8 mega pixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad.
But the main thing are not the Megapixel itself, but rather the quality of the Matrix and the depth.
From this point of view all the current technologies for us, not good enough, because the developers of the Algorithms have more work to do.
It is not only the resolution along the X - and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis to be taken into account.
Also the speed and the number of images per second are important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and frankly, current 30 fps, in particular, for Gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, where the present-day commercial Sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much of the interaction of man and machine is affected.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without the touch and with more frames per second.
Should the number of cameras not be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", where one of them is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected Signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB-camera.
It is not intended for calculation of the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the Problem...
Or the Problem intensifies as more calculations are necessary.
Would be nice to be a flexible, Xbox similar System, in which we have a different Kameraneigungen could play, to see how we in the three-dimensional determination of a Position helps.
- If I remember right, presented by Microsoft, in contrast to Google his glasses to the Public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, the glasses, the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant, out of a Smartphone in the raised Hand to hold, but I think the following: The best variant would be a "changing" augmented reality, when we have a Cloud of the glasses on the Smartphone switch could
The glasses is a personal Gadget and therein lies their strength (Private, only you can see), but also their weakness, because an enhanced reality by means of glasses to prevent that, together with the Other virtual objects can work.
- Let us imagine for a Moment that the Manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also accessible to mere mortals.
There is a Problem, on the critics of this idea is often to point out: There is no sensible response!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What are the answers want your group to this objection?
- In my Lectures I speak often of the fact that the reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough may well be the Integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second-Hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.
It takes print perfectly true!
But there are also technologies that actually are geared to the "images in the air" is something Tangible to give, for example, creates the interference of some targeted Ultraschallstrahlen in a certain point, where the Finger is, a feeling that at the moment but still so weak, as someone blew over the knuckles.
There are also bands for the wrist, on the endings in the fingers impact, this is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried the brain to outwit?
It think that it can feel, what to feel it should, if it is just something that looks?
- This is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
Here lies a further task, with the us for a long time have to fight to be, namely a person who is physically present in a closed room, believe he was, instead, in an open, practically infinite space; here, we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms, as well as large balls.
So far it is the brain only moderately outwit, and we still have many busy years.
This makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so appealing: On many subjects, we are only at the beginning.
