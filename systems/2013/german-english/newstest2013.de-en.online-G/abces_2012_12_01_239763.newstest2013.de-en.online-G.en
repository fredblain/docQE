For four Euro put the institution of the Indonesian volcano your life and your health at risk if you are 70 pounds of sulfur on the steep, stony ways to wear.
There are people for whom their work is a hell, and other work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners, earn their living by sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the East of the Indonesian island of Java to get.
To do this, he every day down on the floor of his crater where rising up from the earth out of the sulfur-containing Gas in contact with the air solidified.
After he had a great Schwefelsteine has broken out, the total of up to 70 kilos can weigh, it transports you into two bamboo baskets on their shoulders, on the sloping paths from stone.
Although there are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, up to a height of 2386 meters rises, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the Schildkr√∂tentempo, with the balance to keep your steps carefully, so you don't slip and fall.
You know that each step of your life can cost as this is a French tourist happened years ago, on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen crashed.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each Kilo of sulfur, which reduce it.
Once at the top, blast its way between the tourists, as Zirkusaffen shooting and running with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, a mining company, a little further down, at an altitude of 1850 metres, has set in
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, since 1960, the Deposits in the volcano and (never been better said) his workers exploited, where you 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Euro cents) for each Kilo of sulfur pays.
The sold then for every 10,000 rupees (83 cents) in the petrochemical industry, because of this Mineral in everyday life is widespread and for the production of matches, Feuerwerksartikeln, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to the Bleaching of sugar is used.
"Because we typically 70 kg, we obtain for each way about 46.000 rupees (3,8 Euro) ", explains to us Anto, in most cases, three routes a day makes.
For each route it needs three hours, what he's done completely at the end of the day he has but then 138.000 rupees (11,5 Euro).
What a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort looks, but the Triple of what he's with the field work would earn.
"The Tagelohn of the miners here, where in the coffee harvest of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) a day to be paid and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167 EUR) is very high," explains the carrier, the previously as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali worked.
There, he earned the 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village in the vicinity, returned, and for a reason that in Indonesia as important as the sulfur is: "I have a girl from Bali married, where they are Hindus, and I have you to Java and brought to convert to Islam".
Anto has Asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently, and his eyes because of the toxic gases irritated.
The 27-year-old Anto since the three years of his life on the Kawah Ijen the game, its sulfur when he is already the first traces, although his face with a mask and special glasses covers.
Anto has Asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently, and his eyes because of the toxic gases from the volcano irritated.
This is the price he wants to Achieve his dream must pay.
"I'll be here for another two years to work, because I have a Shop or Spanish, or French would like to learn," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could be considered as tourist guides, waiters or at the reception of a hotel to work, but instead, it does the work of a Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other institutions and is available each Morning at two o'clock on, because of the sulfur night out, where its characteristic yellow color in the dark bluish sheen.
The shadow challenging, it rises in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, he of his own money has bought into the crater.
About 400 carrier load on the crater floor of the baskets with sulphur on your shoulders.
Despite their large profits has the mining company the Schwefelabbau not mechanized, in order to save costs, and provides the carriers, the own-account work and according to the weight to be paid, no equipment.
You also get to any part of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 Euro) Supplement per camera, the guardians of this nature Park together with the admission fee in the amount of 15,000 rupees (1,2 Euro) of the tourists require, to take pictures of the volcano and the human Tragesel come.

He is capable of up to 110 kg to wear and assured that he continues, "as long as it is", because he has the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years needs.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano my whole life was.
Even if the sulfur throat burns and the eyes itch, if the Wind suddenly turns and the miners in the thick pillars can become trapped, out of the crater rise, men are so hard that no one about serious diseases complains ... of course, apart from the usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blow on the shoulders, the weight of baskets and deformed.
With the basket on his back is Unainik with its 53 years, is only able to 50 kg to wear.
Every day break he and his companions 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, the three Trucks on a Path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 km distance to be transported.

Of his five children works of the Oldest his 30 years as sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the Armseligkeit holds Generation to Generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who, as human workhorses of the Kawah Ijen work.
