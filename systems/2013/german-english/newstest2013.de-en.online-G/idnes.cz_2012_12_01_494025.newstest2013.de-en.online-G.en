Poland and the outer space.
Last week Poland has been on a Ministerratssitzung of the member States of the European space Agency (ESA) as a twentieth of a member of this space Agency added. Poland is the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic on 12. November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with ESA, and participated in the following years several ESA projects.
The path of Poland in the space began admittedly much earlier.
Already before the Second world war employees Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space, although this does not always met with understanding.
I remember, for example, the speech of A. Šternfeld from 6. December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work "entrance to the Astronautics" was presented.
The ideas of the young engineer (geb. in 1905) let the listeners, however, cold, and after years remembered Šternfeld still, that only Dr. Jan Gadomski interest in his work had shown.
Šternfeld won in the year 1934 for "entrance to the Astronautics" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch donated Prix REP-deer.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis worldwide-recognized contribution to the development of the space was, inter alia, thereby acknowledged that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Already in the year 1925 was in Poland a railway trolley built for a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the draft, and the Details of this project remained unknown unfortunately.
It is not even clear whether the rocket to Start or to the deceleration of the trolley should be used.
The information is sourced from the contemporary press.
Began in 1933, the Polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen Shot to deal with.
The research, led the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia, in collaboration with prof Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the surviving documents, it is obvious that the research into the stage of practical Tests penetrated.
The research was then certainly by the invasion of the German Army interrupted.
In the year 1937 appeared in the trade press by Ing. Rohoziński originating draft of a photoelectric Jagdrakete on, and in the following year appeared to be the work of "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both of these projects dealt with the military use of the Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects were for military use the rocket from the Temporary scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinates.
The Committee was set up in 1937, after two years of activity, has been his work, however, from the beginning of the war ended.
For more articles about space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company shall be in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major part of the space dedicated to it.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was to be expected that the exploration of outer space, would have a future.
Already in its early stages, in the year 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accession to the 1951 based International Federation for space, and, in fact, the PTA already in the autumn of 1956 ordinary member.
In the following year became the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Vice-Chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
This office, he had, until his death in 1959 held.
Since 1956 involved in the PTA instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was established in 1957, completed the first launch took place on 10. October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight altitude of 1800 m was approximately 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved Version, the RM-1A, built, and in 1959, began in the Błędów desert flight tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m) long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be in the position to real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should an altitude of up to 14.5 km away, and for the observation of Höhenwinden used.
In 1962, however, was the further development of the set.
The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was in the years 1962 to 1965 developed Meteor-1 rocket.
The rocket was as Zweistufenrakete designed, their total length amounted to 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.
Of this missile were three types have been developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and 1C), differing from each other in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments are distinguished.
The Meteor-1A-rocket had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C about 0,62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude of fraud in all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 in the aviation Institute the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight in October 1970, began.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km of freight.
Later versions of Meteor-2 and Meteor-3 built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960, two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee followed.
Poland participated in the context of the inter cosmos programme in space exploration with Soviet satellites, and, in 1978, the Polish Pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimír Remek second Interkosmonaut.
