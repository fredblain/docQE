Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the Test should be made or not?
The PSA Test manner in fact, sometimes erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results, to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater reluctance of the already indecisive men for the implementation of early diagnosis procedures.
The Test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two specialists obtained.
In the United States of America studies conducted passed numerous confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this Time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the probability of formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
This is why I recommend the Test from the age of 50 years, respectively. 40 years ago, if you are a direct Relative who is already suffering from prostate cancer.
In men afro-American origin, is also at a higher risk.
The most Important thing is to make the right decision, once a cancer has been detected.
There are types of cancer, the aggressive, and others, the indolent.
The patient needs to the extent of the risk of his cancer really be made understandable by the possible options will be identified, in which Prostatakrebse are left untreated, if he is the quality of life in the long run is not affected, and in these cases for a more active Monitoring of the sick.
Today, there are many men, where cancer has recognized, no treatment, since her cancer is not aggressive, and there is no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active Monitoring and provides you with progression of the disease and treatment.
One determined with increasing precision, the criteria for deciding who should be treated, and who is not.
Therefore, I recommend nevertheless, the execution of the Tests.
Most important, it is but, with his doctor to speak, in order to determine whether he should be conducted or not.
In collaboration with the international society for urology Movember has developed a tool, with which it is possible, the pros and cons of PSA testing to evaluate.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research remains the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way, in order to reduce the risk of him developing.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer could be prevented if all eat well and get enough would move.
"If there are no smokers more, would this value to at least 50% increase in", stresses Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the canadian cancer society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of the cancers caused by inheritance.
Several remain totally unclear.
For the canadian cancer society remains the fight against the tobacco dependence is a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It strongly harms the health of the people.
"Today, there are in Quebec 1.5 million. Smokers", says the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the waiver on the cigarette, and you reduce the risk of dying from cancer by half.
The Weight
According to the canadian cancer society to promote Overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease.
You seem to be the risk for breast, column-, rectum, esophagus, pancreas and cervical cancer to increase.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout the life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects", he adds.
The Diet
The organization also recommends that the red meat consumption to a minimum.
In large quantities, it increases the risk of a Grimm - or. Rectal cancer disease.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat due to Smoking, Drying or salts can cause the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, a number of scientists of the relationship between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer studied.
Their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the canadian cancer society are the studies on Vitamin E contradictory.
During a study of the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer has found out, showed a different rather an increase.
The effect of Vitamin D on the cancer was also not clearly shown.
In addition, it emphasises Mr. Beaulieu, how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family history to speak of.
"The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer."
