The Higgs Boson is analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has in the last summer of a certain interest, and for good reason.
We believe in the fact that this Boson at nothing less than the mechanism is involved, for the mass of all objects in the universe is responsible.
And finally, it refers to the last particles whose existence from the standard model of our best, or at least false" explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but empirically not yet been observed.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it's really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we are a real new particles, and that it is the standard model predicted Higgs Boson is very similar.
In addition, this seems to be due to new data to be confirmed, which this week on a large physics Congress in Kyoto were presented, but it still lacks the data, in order to be completely sure.
Go, we nevertheless believe, that it is indeed the Higgs is, there seems to be only a low risk, to deceive, and we will look at what it is about.
There are in this world, a necessarily inviolable law, which means that two objects are not at the same time at the same place may be present.
It is not possible to breach the above rule and try not to be too strong, because they hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out, that for such a law: the Pauli's Ausschlussprinzip, which States that two particles is not the same room at the same time can occupy, if you are in the same quantum state", and this "state" on the Whole, from some of their properties.
Assuming parts of the physicists of particles in two categories.
In a corner there are the good citizen, as Fermions are designated and well-behaved the Pauli principle obey.
And in the other to move the bosons, an ugly gang of anarchists, for whom nothing is sacred, and in any case not of this principle, which means that you are in fact at the same time in the same place.
These bosons are divided according to the site, The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (by the way, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the mesons, which we can't handle, and the "Kraftteilchen", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs Boson related somehow.
It must however be stressed that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are, as you might think.
If you are capable of this chronicle to read, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the Photon, or the "photon", the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electrical charge accelerated or a change of direction, the electromagnetic field is exactly in this place "disturbed", like a Pebble in a pond.
Through this "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon and thus one of the bosons, "the carrier of the power".
More Stable Field
The same applies for the Higgs Boson, with the difference that a different field, Higgs field, "disturbed" to this Boson.
However, the Higgs field is very much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the causative agent must be very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond, its surface only by a very large rock ridged could be.
That is why a huge particle accelerators, such as the CERN necessary, the Large Hadron Collider is a Ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to such energies to achieve.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to the relationship between the Higgs and the mass to explain.
There are, in fact, not all the particles and not all of the materials with the electromagnetic field interacting with.
Some, such as magnets, to do this, but others are not - for example, would a sheet of paper never even in the refrigerator.
And likewise, all the particles do not interact with the Higgs field: those who do it, have a mass, while the other (like the Photon) no mass.
For what can all this research now to "be good", asks woman Plamondon?
For the science, they serve to test the standard model (SM), and they allow the physicists also, all the deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM to examine exactly.
By the way, there are numerous physicists, the eagerly-in the hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference a door to a "new physics" open and some of the holes of the model could cram.
It is necessary to tell, that the latter is still serious shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the force of gravity (oops!) and the dark matter provides approx. 80% of the matter in the universe (re-ups!).
However, there have been at CERN such deviations until now not been found.
Impact
The implications of this research for the General population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no God.
By the way: in the early ' 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell labs, does not suspect, that their Work in such a Revolution would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle - the Bell Labs has worked, in which the Laser in the 1960s was invented, and the 1962 even the first continuous-wave lasers (they were the first pulsed) developed has already said that the Laser at the beginning rather than a "Laborspielerei" was considered.
Imagine...
In addition, for applications from all of the instruments, which the research surrounded.
For example, in turn, has Willard Boyle 1969 during his Work in optics, a small light sensor developed.
Although it is not the original purpose was, this Sensor today, all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and gave him the 2009 Nobel prize for physics to be introduced.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you can never know...
