Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto, is facing a difficult Start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto, on his assumption of office prepared, analyzed Wants to Grant to the BBC him upcoming challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico city is particularly bad.
Even better days this is a always congested city, but on Monday was a Ring of steel was built in several important traffic routes in the capital absperrt and on the streets for Chaos.
The aim was not, however, commuters on the way to work to bother you, but protesters to prevent the Parliament to reach.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto the Präsidentenbinde and the leadership of the Nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons has Mexico economically well-to prove, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, in the last six years we have 60,000 lives.
"My government is strongly committed to ensuring that violence is to reduce," said Pena Nieto the beginning of this week in the Oval Office, the US-American President, Barack Obama.
I'm going to have a new security strategy suggest that we can achieve this goal.
Before he with the US President on an equal footing, it was Pena Nieto, Governor of his home state of Mexico to act.
In this densely populated large part of the country, the capital city that surrounds it, are the opinions about the new head of state is divided.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo one remembers, for example, to him.
Residents of the resort write to him, the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To the city, on one of the highways go, Pena Nieto had built and a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads represent, as it once was.
Plaque with his name also hang out outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive, interactive Museum for climate change.
"We expect him to be real and lasting changes", his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, as a Congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI works.
In particular, what is the security and the economy is concerned, we hope to have an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in Power was the PRI in 2000, Vicente Fox replaced.
Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside of the Präsidentenpalasts of Los Pinos great expectations Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the Opposition, the new President, it lacks in substance, he dislikes.
He was a very direct man, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, especially, but he was also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the heads of state do not share many people have this view of their former Governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico city itself.
And the problems in the community are of critical urban nature.
At the beginning of this year the military power on to in the neighborhoods operating to fight drug gangs, and violence against women is a particularly acute Problem.
On a patch of wasteland near a large landfill were alone in the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women left behind.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto were in the state of Mexico over 1,000 women murdered - a statistic that even in the city of Ciudad Juarez exceeds that for their violence and the murder of innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that it is the Problem of the Frauenmorde during his term of office, at least not adequately addressed.
But in the worst case have his government their eyes to the issue closed.
In a concrete construction, typical for the run-down quarter, fights Irinea Buendia with tears, and when she told me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows.
The official Version of events, according committed Mariana 2010 suicide.
But her family believes, that of your significant other was murdered.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the rigor Mortis had already been used.
While her mother was her story, looks down from the wall a picture of Mariana down on us. It is next to a cross attached to a single word: justice.
But exactly this, so the family, I have to get out of her until now denied.
The authorities have treated me as if I was a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.
You want to get your judgment simply accepted and the mouth holds.
"But this is not possible, when there are so many flaws and omissions were," she says.
If President Pena Nieto, on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde receives, accepts, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been in the last six years of violent crime affected, and the new President has promised during his term of office, especially around this Problem to worry about.
"I hope that as President he is, how he was Governor," said the PRI Congressman Olvera, in the Valle del Bravo.
But just afraid of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza the most.
