"The great and mighty" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While members of Parliament and civil rights activists to discuss, what is the Use of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants bring Criminal act already with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million workers after Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the upkeep of the home remaining families to earn.
On 1. December was a law in force, which provides that any migrant worker a Test, the knowledge of the Russian language, certified, must discard one of them.
Previously, this provision only for migrants who are in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail want to work.
However, should the Tests with the time, according to the Federal migration authorities in the future, for all migrant workers to duty.
One must not only language tests, but also Tests in the Russian history and the basics of the legislation drop.
Language skills both for the receipt as well as the extension of the work permit has to be demonstrated.
Exceptions apply only for the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
Also by this law excluding persons, their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense of the issues and the protection of the rights
The whole of the regulatory Agency will be under the Aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of people's friendship, Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can the Tests in all the cities of store; already were in Russia already more than 160 corresponding centers opened.
The Initiative for the introduction of the testing was made by the deputies of the state Duma and the Federal migration authorities supported.
Civil libertarians, however, presented before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: What does the Whole thing?
What changes will bring the regulation, language skills, to demonstrate the need, both for the Russians as well as for the workers?
Especially, counter spokesman for the migration authorities, the question, the number of forced laborers to decrease.
"A lot of talk now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers", says the head of the representation of the Federal migration authorities in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights must, however, already before their departure to be protected.
Only an organized recruitment is 90% of the problems of foreign workers to solve.
Encounter problems migrants without occupation, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills necessarily people with bad intentions to meet him under the pretext of the help in a dark, narrow barrack stuck, where he worked with dozens of his peers months without food and documents to wait 12 to 14 hours on the day of toil.
Us achieve many of the complaints of our migrants.
"In the home will make you A promise, and on arrival you will be scammed, get their passports taken and does not receive the promised reward", confirmed by the head of the main Directorate for labour migration of Tajik migration authorities, Tolib Schwaripow.
Do not scold, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, in Russia you want to make money, too, that not only the language of the destination country does not dominate, but also in their own language hardly in writing expressions.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as much as the Evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only a reasonable primary education afford.
Because in their families, there is still not even have the money, to feed the children, let alone, you decent clothes, shoes and school Supplies to buy.
As a Teenager to take these children then immediately the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language skills", give it to.
"You feel degraded and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize respect of the law following important aspect.
The Test must only migrants with a legal Status drop.
They have this Status does not, so there is no check and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, holds the majority of the migrant workers continues to be illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "access to Unauthorized persons is prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy in Russia an official Status.
The reason there are bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the language difficulties.
In addition, the cost of the legalization of money: 12 to 16 Thousand rubles.
A fake registration, you can quickly and only for one and a half Thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not a registered user, and arise from then, cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Just no cost for false papers shy"
Already on the day on which the law entered into force, it turned out that not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants be a fake.
Some of the fake certificates, the completion of the tests to certify were already of the employees of the Federal migration authorities beschlaggenommen.
The fake papers have an ordinary color printer printed.
Of course, received the new owner of this for a good reason: Every Migrant, the hoped, so the Tests to spare, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost for the official Test: This costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles.
Moreover, that the most important immediate task of the System against corruption, to protect, so the certificates will not be easily purchased, are both public officials as well as civil rights activists agree.
For the Moment, the authorities of the guest-workers, the first Time through the Test fast, just promise that you have time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
In addition, newcomers without language skills Authorities in areas in which there is no active communication with people is necessary.
