In the South of Azerbaijan to reach many people have a biblical old age.

A search for clues in the country, in the 97-Year-old is still relatively young.
The ride through the Talysch mountains is extremely romantic to call.
The minibus rumbles on the winding road past the densely forested hills, raging rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is green and lush, you might think you were in the black forest.
But this is the deepest in the South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyschen, not much is known, except that they are perfect, Persian, as well as Aserisch speaks and very durable.
Terminus is in Lerik.
The small town of shows off to a strong side of the architecture from the Soviet era, the so-not in the picturesque mountain landscape fit.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too burdensome, the directions of Azerbaijan's capital city Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabled wealth of the country, its Oil in the Caspian sea owes, is here in the province has not yet arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the potential to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku was in may with the Eurovision Song Festival, famous - and in the next year we have here is a Festival of the oldest people in the world", says Fatulayeva.
She is the Director of the Museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, documented, older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a Black-and-White photo.
Here is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years ago, a child fathered
But the controversial Star of the Museum is the shepherd He Müslümov, the 168-year-old should be.
A birth certificate, however, there is not.
And in the face of the oldest documented people, the 122 years old, appears Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.
"in 1805 he was here in the Region, born in 1973, he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three Times and was 23 had children, at the age of 136 years he still has a daughter who have witnessed.
Has He Müslümov so in his old age, at a couple of decades will be charged?
But Rembrandt Scholz, Researchers at the Max-Planck-Institute in Rostock, of the Aged in Central Asia belongs to.
"Quite a lot of hochaltrige people, there are also some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia life is extremely lots of very old men".
Because of the lack of documents is, however, no scientific evidence about the age, to lead, particularly since the civil registry were missing.
Every day becherweise melted Butter
But the fact is that the people of the Region around Lerik remarkably often, a biblical age.
Currently, there are 20 persons older than 100 years.
So why live here in the South are so many very old people?
The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Curator Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is up to the diet of the table.
But that of all the high calorie diet of the Talyschen to be so healthy, meat, bread, and especially dairy products, love and many of which are a daily glass of melted Butter drink, appears from the nutritional point of view is just not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the people are young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is for these Latitudes is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, the claims, 143 descendants, who lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the ground with a butter churn, you tirelessly out - and ist rolling.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both of which are long-grandparents.
Also two young children jump around.
In the kitchen to prepare the guests with tea, in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu lenses is served.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Rank and file, under her headscarf hides long, dark blonde braids, her son pride before us reveals.
I have my hair is always washed with milk, so they went, I never made and kept their color.
"Shampoo I've also never used", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has just eaten, what of your own yard, and was, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life I have not a single Time in the supermarket food purchased.
Then, she tells her husband, who was in the army.
At the worst it was in the period after the Second world war.
But anything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
The Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult to the father of the Nation is driven to his country as a dictator ruled that knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in Power, and later was taken over by his son, Ilham, the rudder.
After all, there is no Need of Azerbaijan Old.
230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros), receives Mirzayeva of a monthly pension, for local circumstances, an amount that you can live very well.
And maybe has also Mirzayevas long grizzled son of law: "The Old enjoy in our culture, respect."
You are living in the midst of the extended family, to be loved, cared for and are happy.
If no reason is, as long as you can to stay alive
