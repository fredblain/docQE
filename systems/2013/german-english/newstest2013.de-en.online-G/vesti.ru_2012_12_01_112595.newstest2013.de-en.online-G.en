Birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of ships with people of planet earth to embark on the search for a Ersatzplaneten.
To save humanity, poses the important question of how we in the weightlessness, or on the Ersatzplaneten can reproduce?
Many choices there are in my opinion not.
De facto, there are only two real planet, we at least hypothetically could inhabit.
"Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars comparatively Pro, there are on the surface of Venus at a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only in large amount, or in the orbit of Venus, so in All possible.
The question of reproduction in All treated the researchers first in terms of the Flora.
Already half a century before were experiments with plants is carried out.
The fourth Generation of the in Orbit cultivated peas does not differ in the least from the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, specifically by tiny fruit fly (Drosophila), in Orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into outer space, in order to explore how the microgravity on the development of Embryos effect.
It develops a normal chick.
But then, the Problem begins.
"The Problem is that the chick Just have to find it; it must be on his legs and start to move forward," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid ground began to spin the Chicks wild.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The Chicks did not react to light and Loud.
Four days later, they died then simply.
"Twice we left the Chicks hatch and made the Whole thing, simply because it is impossible for there to work with them," believes Vladimir Sychew to the failed Experiment with the chick at All.
The last Brutk√§fig with animals flew 16 years ago in the Orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments continued.
However, on the Biosatelliten "Bion" only same-sex species.
It was an Experiment with rats, the already fertilized sent into space.
In principle, it was nothing Special is established.
"That was just with the Biosatelliten, but again it was only a single Experiment, and the research must be continued", noted Vladimir Sychew.
After landing got the Weltraumratten offspring.
The problems of the reproduction right in space, you can not solve the problem.
The task is difficult.
Animals from their natural habitat to be torn, you can simply your reproductive drive not follow.
In contrast to animals, man could the principle.
Homo sapiens is to Think in the abstract capable and can have a similar emotional Background to create.
From ethical Considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
However, women are already flying since 50 years in space.
The biggest risk, there Tereschkowa.
The most Valuable thing mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on the earth would have to answer the following question: can Withstand the space flight?
It is after this flight a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered this question," says Raumfahrtveteran Vakhtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after her space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, gave birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaja, which twice in Orbit, and even Work outside of the spacecraft performed, a son.
However, still remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights, everything went well and you healthy were young.
"The more, the more dangerous it is for flights into Orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, the mankind must for new Ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial Gravitation are looking for.
The Hydrolabor in Vorbereitungszentrum of cosmonauts is a mandatory Station during the flight preparation.
Here, in a state of uncertainty win the cosmonauts Routine for the work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment; however, infants perception of water as a natural Element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testify, that the life of the country stepped out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months in the womb of the mother in the amniotic fluid is, and that it is easier for water to get used to.
In principle, this is logical, because from birth up to the first Swim just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to do something to forget", says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child weightlessness so a much more natural condition, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness forms the abdominal and pelvic muscles very fast back and this also increases the ability of the child to say.
Well, we can avoid this by geburtseinleitende AIDS.
The birth could also, for example, in a Spezialkammer take place around the child to say.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, does a child need also artificial gravity.
Without the earth's gravity to feel the organism, the skeleton and the muscles do not develop.
A newborn child can be in Orbit, not as an adult Training in a Belastungsanzug be plugged in.
It is simply the absence of what his life is of vital importance.
"This Experiment, which together we make, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to a disabled person, a totally non-conformist people to the world will bring," says the head of the Bioethikkommission of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is mere theory.
At some point, but it is reality, if the man of the earth in their spaceships to a distant planet to leave the home for her in the All-born descendants.
