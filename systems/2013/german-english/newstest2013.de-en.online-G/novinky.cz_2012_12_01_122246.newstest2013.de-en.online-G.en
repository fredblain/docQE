Guidelines for the Inflation of the balloons, for bananas, and for the circus
The Server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the most absurd Bank charges exclaims, this year has decided, in the competition "most Absurd regulation, respectively. Idea from the EU-workshop" to organize.
"On this idea brought us the recently by the EU put forward a Plan, a women's quota of 40% in the Management of large European companies to introduce," said Patrik Nacher, for the organization of this survey, care, against the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominees absurdities is for example the judgment of the European court of justice about the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then enjoyed women in the life insurance is an advantage, because they are for the insurance companies lens at a lower risk.
"More incredible ideas from the EU-workshop by the end of this year, will be nominated.
The actual voting takes place by end February 2013", said Afterwards.
To the controversial EU regulations include, among others, the binding of an admixture of Bioethanol fuel in their Wake, naturschädigend is, furthermore, the prohibition of reliable thermometer, just because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes contain, or the Directive to the size of Hühnerkäfigen, because in this year the eggs are much more expensive.
Criticism harvested in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "Butteraufstrich" or the ban on the sale of incandescent bulbs.
Bananas need to 14 cm
The EU apparatus decides often under the pressure of this or that Lobby of trade and industry, whose claims in Brussels in the rule of one or several member States are represented (so tried the Czech Republic currently, for example, with Veto threat, the claims of Czech banks to enforce).
Lobby interests were behind it, that bananas are of the highest grades in the EU, at least 14 cm long and no "Krümmungsanomalie".
The European Commission has defended with the Argument that only the variation in national standards harmonize, the trade of which would interfere.
The standards for fruit and vegetables were by the EU against the resistance of some countries already with the note softened that the existing policy to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU-regulation of last year, according to the balloons on the sale with the note that children under eight years, the balloon is not without the supervision of an adult bloat.
The EU appealed to an American study, in accordance with balloons is the leading cause the painful death of children.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
Curious ideas, there are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a policy, the European officials is concerned, everyone in the EU have an official role, due to the sensitivity of the issue for Greece is not the name of Macedonia, use and must instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) say.
The Server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominees in cooperation with the Association of liberal Economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above mentioned. Absurdities also the EU regulation on the extent of food on the territory of a member state.
The EU laid out so that the maximum volume of food festival, that on the day of our EU-accession on the territory of the Czech Republic are allowed.
The Czech Republic exceeded for example, the volume specified for Pilzkonserven for a high fine threatened.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed with the idea that certain countries of money for it, so that you are not a sea, or the idea of funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were certainly not from Brussels, but also from Prague.
"We are not disadvantaged by this, that we have no sea.
We are in the EU, apply for a refund", declared in the fall of 2004, the former agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an Argument he stated that the Grain harvest is very high and the state-owned stock as a result of the sog. Interventionseinkäufe were full to overflowing.
Since the Czech Republic have another way to seaports have, the EU should, according to Palas hundreds of millions of euros to pay us.
The European Commission came to the Czech Republic finally so far, however, that a tender on the purchase of grain from countries, organised, with no access to the sea.
Funding is available for applications for subsidies offered the municipalities of the Ministry for regional development under the direction of Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically, if this means for the drafting of Fördergeldanträgen to Brussels to act.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the member States, although it is easy to become a target of criticism, the efforts of the EU to regulate and, thus, also to the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserves in the opinion of some experts, however, more recognition.
A more serious Problem in the opinion of these experts, rather, the EU funding for projects that absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of the European Integration have in common, however, for the negotiations of individual member States were enforced.
Emotions calls in this country is also the fact that the Czech Republic, similarly to other member States in Brussels to have the right to use specific names of traditional products must fight and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic, according to a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose Tradition with us till the 19th. Century back, had our manufacturers, however, in "Tuzemák" rename.
The name of Rum may be used only for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat be used, not for products from sugar beets.
In the official list of the registered in the EU in products diving in the society of the world-famous cheese Feta and Gorgonzola, Luebeck marzipan or Parmaschinkens now the Karlovy vary rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Trebon, or even the hops hop on.
With a community trademark may be because of the Pardubice gingerbread or the subject in hořice roles Breasts.
