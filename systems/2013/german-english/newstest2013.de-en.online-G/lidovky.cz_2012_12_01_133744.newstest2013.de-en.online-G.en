The Film Argo: When it's at its worst, Hollywood call
In November 1979 occupied a Mob demonstrierender Islamist students the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they asked for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the Revolution, in the USA, who had fled, for decades the patronage of his Regime maintained.
For the American government gave it out of this Situation no positive way out - you could not afford it, the Shah to throw overboard, because this is the trust of its allies in other countries massively damaged would have.
At the same time, she was not able, in Iran, where the Revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime that led to the release of the hostages to enforce.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco, when a violent attempt of the hostage release made it worse.
The caught taken diplomats were finally after 444 days released after negotiations by the Algerian government has been taught.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity, as well as antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter's against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in the year 1980.
The Film Argo of the Director and actor Ben Affleck describes an Episode of this story, the USA a small Teilsieg brought.
Immediately prior to the occupation of the Embassy managed to six Botschaftsmitarbeitern to escape.
This ended after many complications in the residence of the canadian Ambassador.
The CIA succeeded in cooperation with the canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; it helped them an extravagant Story to mask their true identity - they traveled with canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, the supposedly in the country filming locations for a Science-Fiction Film visited.
Combination of Genres
The experts of "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed Plan was also made by the cooperation of Hollywood required.
So the camouflage became credible, articles appeared on this film project in journals, there were press conferences are held, and the fictitious manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of this Operation have been long kept secret. The Film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a more realistic political Thriller, but at the same time, a so-called. "Caper Movie", that is the story of a successful Husarenst√ºcks such as, for example, the Film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the Film the Stimmungsebenen - on the one hand, the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence to be iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the Filmfassung the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA Headquarters and other institutions, such as the men in suits at the conference table, on the Amtsfluren, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is with this Film is a remarkable restart his career succeeded.
From a dismissed actor is a respectable Director and as an actor, he is now no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime is Not an easy job ("Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first movie, not in his native Boston is the Director's plays.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, this film Director from the Standard Hollywood took flight.
Affleck proves this sense, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played".
The best scenes of the movie playing in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that actually took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the Embassy is in its Clarity to be very impressive, and it provides nevertheless, the feeling of confusion and uncertainty that occurs when somewhere once the story moves.
A similar effect can be achieved Affleck with his Team in fictional scenes (the wrong stage crew scared at a Bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The Director had to face the fact that the story is actually not many in the cinematic sense exciting scenes.
With the Few works he, however, quite successful, but he reality is sometimes a little nachhilft - what then is not always so elegant effect (the scenes of the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a phone call in America is averted, or even the car chase on the runway, seem a little contrived).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, by the need is caused, to a lot of action in too many places, the need to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their role as Hollywood-staff very charming, their figures, however, would more space earned, and they are in the Film is far from alone.
Afflecks Film loses a bit of traction. It is a Film you with some degree of interest and the design, construction, and to a Thriller from the 70's. Years reminiscent of Retro-style of truth.
Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult.
As a reminder of a until today in some way living piece of history, and as proof of this, as covered but the ideas of the Almighty and all-knowing intelligence services are, however, he is sufficient.
