My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are due to the lack of opportunities forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to be immigrants to blame - you call them hard times in the memory, he says
Navarrette is of the view that Mexican Americans caught between two worlds are
On a recent trip to Mexico city I had only just crossed the hall and went to the passport check arrived, as perplexity at me wide-made.
Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of what I should go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up and became my whole life, "Mexicans".
An ethnic abbreviation, just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I decided to "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's, there was no need for abbreviations, or hyphens.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to keep me in this language at both Ends of an interview to claim.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent, I will also not let go.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that Moment of this week, as the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto the White house visited with President Obama to meet.
On the Agenda were all those topics that you would expect, when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and Commerce.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in the growth of the Mexican economy to speak of. It is one of the reasons that Mexicans today with the same high level of probability in Mexico to stay, rather than emigrate to the United States.
He would like to engage with the United States and Canada ally and a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to take the war against Mexico, the drug cartels continue, even if he has no details to be called.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans are wasting probably never be a single thought to the fact that the United States in 1848 in Mexico for the pictures and the leadership of the country under the force of the gun to compel them more than half of its territory to leave.
But for Mexicans, in centuries, and not in minutes think, are the memories of this event is not to be overlooked.
So, as soon as a U.S. government official also only mildest criticism of Mexico exercises, you can hear it in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country's complaints about how the Americans, the sovereignty of their neighbouring country beset.
And the children of Montezuma's go on the warpath.
And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico, in truth, in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Lust, resentment to speak?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the country offers a lot of chances, and others, for which it does not do this.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio life, is that at one point in our family tree a Person - maybe a parent or grandparent - no Chance in Mexico offered and got in the direction of the North emigrated.
And in most cases, this Person is a profile dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our Loyalty is to you.
Not Mexico.
And although, perhaps, we now live the American dream, good schools and good Jobs have received, we must never lose sight of it the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes may blurry, but what about our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we have many members of the Mexican ruling class not like.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, is our existence is a Symbol of failure.
If our families are not in Mexico failed, they would not have gone.
And then we would not now behind the Seidenvorhang trapped see - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, in Guadalajara and was born as a child legally in the United States, immigrated, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions, because Mexicans have a clearer idea on who you are, and Mexican Americans take them this evil.
While U.S. citizen, it sees itself as part of the two countries.
However, many Mexican Americans that I know of have the feeling that neither the one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican Band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You can enjoy the Best of both worlds, but in none of them rooted.
In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we Mexicans seen.
As I have during my journey to learn, there's something that this relationship is even more complex: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the Bildungsb√ºrgertums want your Connections to the Diaspora.
You want to Mexican Americans than temporary "Ambassador" for Mexico, its interests in the United States.
We want our American colleagues tell about how great a visit to this country and to put pressure on the political leadership to exercise their ties to Mexico to intensify.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, the rampant corruption and the Drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I'm afraid, because you have to go through this alone, Amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some of the Mexicans are not ready yet, the United States for dealing with Mexico, one and a half centuries to forgive, you must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for that cherish, such as their family members until not so long ago were treated.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican", as I thought.
