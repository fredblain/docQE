Messenger: NASA discovered ice on mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the planet mercury ice cream.
The ice cover, you may want to up to 20 metres thick.
The U.S. space Agency NASA, the existence of ice on the planet mercury is demonstrated.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also there, frozen water, such as from three on Thursday in the journal "Science" published studies suggest.
The Messenger probe have found evidence that it permanently in the shadowed Region of the planet in a sheet of ice.
This should be at least 30 centimetres, and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or, possibly, asteroids, on the mercury hammered.
Nobody bring the Fund of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the Chefwissenschaftler the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature of the mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Erdenb√ºrgern probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix, the Depths of the universe to explore.
From time to time, send pictures to the earth: Small, as well as peepholes into infinite space.
The image comes from a camera, the German scientists from the Max Planck Institute have developed.
The eight planets in our solar system, in addition, the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, the past Neptune orbits around the sun, is Ceres, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006 no "Planet".
This section of the image of an infrared image from Spitzer shows a "family portrait" of countless Sternengenerationen: The oldest stars are as blue dots to recognize, difficult to identify the pink "newborn" in Sternenkreissaal.
This sternenbildende Region of scientists unromantic W5 - has the telescope pointed in the constellation Cassiopeia discovered, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has the Spitzer space telescope, Nasa added.
The Donut-shaped Ring is made from Material that is the star in the dying process herausschleuderte.
In the huge Trifid nebula, 5400 light years away from earth, arising out of Gas and dust new star.
The Spitzer space telescope, Nasa shot this photo of the galactic Geburtsstube.
The Pleiades star cluster, The "seven sisters", at night, seen with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors better.
Like a red-Age looks of the Helix nebula on this infrared photograph of the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its Similarity with a mortal continent brought this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular colours.
This Babystern was in its full beauty only by the infrared detectors Spitzer to be included.
Saturn and its rings: How they are made, is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
You might be the Remains of a Saturn-moon, the 4.5 billion years ago disappeared without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the color scheme will be taking pictures of spiral galaxies true works of art.
By the European southern Observatory published photograph shows the several thousand light-years away in Trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The Name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided in three parts, dreigespalten), since dark Staubstreifen the glowing heart of the star-birthplace three share.
In the constellation Ophiuchus, astronomers have been the harbinger of a cosmic collision photographed: 400 million light-years away from the earth lawn of the nuclei of two verschmelzender galaxies each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star-birth drew the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who technical abbreviations are not, like your nickname southern wheel of fire.
The photo from the Hubble space telescope shows an excerpt from the Irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light years distant fog consists of specks of dust, the ten to one hundred Times smaller than ordinary dust.
This picture was made of the optical and x-ray images of different types of telescopes together.
It shows a Ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from earth.
This group of galaxies, Arp 273 called, took the Hubble space telescope for Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is what researchers call UGC 1810.
In this Nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our milky way.
The Sternenwiege always produces new Youngster.
Also this star-cloud connected with the rosette nebula, brings new Babysterne - 5000 light years away from earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small Black hole there is no dust, but only Gas.
Researchers suspect that he only shortly after the big Bang, when the universe mainly hydrogen was to be found.
Our insight into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope should 1608 by Hans Lipperhey have been invented before Galileo Galilei it a year later to Sternenbeobachtung began.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes become larger and larger and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper.
for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes looks into space over two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - alone in the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about eleven metres.
The disadvantage of cheap construction: The telescope is in his elevation lashed, and so in his mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is in the angle of elevation fixed.
Its special feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This ranges, namely - despite a comparatively low mirror - the world's largest optical telescopes approach.
With the help of a radiotelescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) listen to researchers All for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), each computer owners to help, by computing power is available.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - his name.
With its total of four Mirror can the telescope also the middle infrared spectrum lighting.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope planned.
His primary mirror should whopping 42 meters and almost 1000 mirror elements put together.
With images, but at the earliest in 2018 is to be expected.
Until 2007 were the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirror each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, next to you with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF in the sky looks.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope, with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an Illustration to marvel at.
The most important impressions from the All, however, provides the Hubble space telescope.
Since the 24. In April 1990, it provides pictures of the far-off worlds.
Since March 2009, is looking for the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets - especially to those which are habitable.
On 2. February 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn were determined.
In the picture are the final launch preparations at the space telescope Kepler documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the earliest in 2018, on Board a Ariane5 rocket into space shot.
The primary mirror of the Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should be according to the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big Bang are looking for.
Scientists assume, that even at the South pole of the mercury ice exists.
However, there are no reliable data, because the Messenger far closer to the North pole to the planet orbits.
Radar measurements have for decades been suggested that it is on the mercury ice cream.
By the 2004 launched Messenger probe - the first, to the mercury orbits - the scientists have now certainty.
