In Colorado, there are no clear guideline for the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-year-old Community College Student and a footballer Anthony Orozco is in the South-East of Colorado for an Offence before a court in this state will soon be legal: The possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a whistle, he smoked.
Orozco, according to he and some friends at a Septembertag with the car in Lamar near the border of Kansas on the road, when they were stopped.
After the police officers marijuana in the car had found, was Orozco for the possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia pre - peccadilloes, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars are provided and received a court date.
"We are treated as Criminals", so Orozco.
But he is also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the conclusion of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use to legalize the answer depends, in hundreds of minor drug offences less from the law, as the location.
Hundreds of offences and to marijuana turn, here and in the state of Washington, the similar measures are approved, has already dropped.
The police keep track of adults over 21 years of age, no longer for possession of small dimensions. This is permitted by law, as soon as the new laws in the next few weeks to enter into force.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced existing Marihuanadelikte pursue quote still people in court.
At the same time, voices of several cities, from the suburbs of Denver's up to the Western Mountains to the new, state-licensed Marihuanageschäfte at the opening in their communities to prevent it.
"This Situation is evolving so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, East of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington scratching at a loss on the head.
They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licence system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a period to 1. December 2013 eyes.
In Washington, it is felt that Colorado is in any case the majority of the States in advance, what the regulation of marijuana. There was the drug only for medical purposes and then to the personal use of legalized.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore good for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Inspectorate for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also that there is no place or System can do more, as in the sense of a rough guide to serve.
"We have no real precedent, and we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, occurs at the 6. December in force, and as such is also the end point of a grey area, in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the ownership was legalized.
And unpleasant Praxisfragen need at this time to be clarified, for example, such as the state requirement of a "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of Cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 meters to schools, Parks, playgrounds, childcare facilities to be agreed upon.
"Nowhere is it harder to be a site for a licensed Cannabisgeschäft to find than in urban areas, especially in the Metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed group.
On 21. November sent Chief Oates its employees in Aurora an E-Mail, in which he stated that the public Prosecutor would be smaller Marihuanadelikte for persons over 21 years of age no longer pursue, and that the police "from now on" no criminal charges for these Offenses aspire to become.
Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban standards for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana would prevail and drug traffickers continue to pursue.
In Weld County in the North of Colorado represents district attorney Ken Buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he gave his authority would cases of Marihuanabesitz continue to pursue, mainly to consumers for the withdrawal to move.
Currently have to 119 persons for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana to answer before court, although many also for other offences were charged.
"Our authority has the duty to violations to keep track of which were carrying to the offences concerned", let Buck in a statement announced.
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters of the marijuana Initiative refused, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults for the possession of smaller amounts of not longer.
District attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided, however, not all of the outstanding Besitzverfahren to drop.
"I don't think that I have time to waste, enforce the law, until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado, the measure is supported, was, from the outset, clearly, that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of the government and the legal system to agree.
And the contradictory reactions in the entire state promoted among local officials a deep dichotomy in terms of the big green Experiment-a-days.
In Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it were a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for Marihuanadelikte before the court standing accused represents and on the spot, as a spokesman for the national organization for the Reform of Marihuanagesetzen acts.
"You have such a large part of your life is spent, people are prosecuted, that the legalization still can't accept", he believes.
As the first States, which have smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol treat, Colorado, and Washington as a national Musterfälle for the legalization of drugs traded.
While advocates and government officials to an era legal sale prepare wait for you at the same time also nervous on the instructions of the Federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the Federal level will continue as a criminal Offence wants to treat.
Advocates of the Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the Ministry of justice to yield.
Despite several controversial arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States for the most part, is permitted.
Kevin A. Sabet, former policy adviser to the Obama government is of the view that detectives although probably no doors, to smaller amounts, the seizure of drugs, but probably Balk, under the new legislation, legal, state-regulated marijuana shops to tolerate.
Several cities in Colorado wait not even sure that the Federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day approved some local government authorities moratoriums on new medical marijuana shops, although these only in about a year could open.
Last week decided to Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, probably next week will be adopted.
"We don't want to be in a Position advised, when we have someone license, and then at the Federal level is a big issue," said Bob Nicholson, member of the city Council.
Our community is against this amendment voted.
We align ourselves with what the community has decided, for which the state has decided.
There are still many open questions.
