With Bitcoin is to Pay and Sell without Bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of Central banks, identified transactions and handling charges between the parties Involved.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political Vision tangible: the Belief that the current Bankmonopolen crafted monetary system, to financial crises.
In fact, that is by Satoshi Nakamoto (a Pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (dollars, Euro, etc convertible) as well as a Protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, that the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network have already been approximately 200,000 transactions.
Some thousands of web sites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, a peak of $ 30 (23 Euro) had reached, he fell five months later, on 2 dollars before he today to around ten Dollar has recovered (the courses are available on the website bitcoincharts.com listed).
Nothing particularly Impressive in comparison to the world trade of real-world currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in an in October, a report published on virtual currencies of interest shown.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in the competition with the Dollar or the Euro," and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "Credits", which used to be in a video game to move forward, it is possible to Play win or buy (and sometimes also zur√ºcktauschen).
The social network Facebook has also such a System is developed.
However, the trade each Time from a Central authority is checked and edited.
With Bitcoin are all the nodes at the same time, the Depositary of the Rechnungsbuchs, examiners, money issuers, as well as the buyer and the seller.
How does this network?
Any transaction between two users takes place in reality between two E-Mail addresses in the Form of an E-Mail instead.
With the difference that the user for any payment of a change of address can choose what the anonymity.
A number of this transaction-related data is electronically by a double encryption system signed.
In this way, the network can the authenticity of the transaction check.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the entire network widespread accounting book of the public accounts exist.
The crucial step is to put these new transaction in this book are entered.
This is done using a mathematical task on the computers is launched, with the winner, a kind of preliminary Zentralbankier is, has the privilege of being, this additional line to add.
It is a Fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unique fingerprint.
The Computer "take" the new transaction and add a number to add, before the Whole "chops".
The goal is to be the one to find a number of special fingerprint (lots of zeros at the beginning).
If this number was found, the other node easily check if it is correct.
The transaction is thus permanently with the chain of all other transactions related, and any modification would the fingerprint change.
If a user with the intention to Defraud two Times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for, would be only one of the two transactions from the network will be validated and the other remains without a link, since both have different fingerprints.
The Computer, the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent Inflation is this reward regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The circulating Bitcoins are thus to 21 million limited, but up to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, what a certain amount of leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task with every improvement in the computing power increases.
The life of the network has already UPS and Downs had.
The web sites, services for Bitcoin deploy, were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
"Used, the vulnerability does not affect the actual Protocol," says Pierre Noizat, just Paymium has introduced the company for the payment with real money, and the network Bitcoin uses.
The ECB also reported about the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also these shortcomings.
Key actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Of Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, you will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir, and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the book contains analyzed and shown that almost 80% of the Bitcoins not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega-Sale" started.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, for the company Coinabul works, the Bitcoins in Gold converted.
Pierre Noizat, the also the author of a book about this currency is firmly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk.
His System Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin for the validation of the transactions, the cheaper.
In addition, managed by the holder's identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The System can be at the dealers are easy to implement, and the Latter have no new terminal or computer programs to install.
You just need to specify an address, a telephone, "photographed and recognized", Pierre Noizat, assures that he is thousands of users.
There is a General Trend was in the hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally oriented systems to be reconsidered.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin interspersed, but in 2013, could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, by the way, the different today as a highly respected risks in case of success of this currency to re-evaluate.
