Old battles, new middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be as unexpected cornerstone for peace prove
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The recent bloody events seem to have such a hope to nip in the Bud.
In the midst of the usual finger-pointing, numerous buildings reduced to rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first Time of rockets from Gaza, near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy city of Jerusalem taken.
However, even though the Israelis and the Palestinians in their historical conflict caught seem, is changing the middle East around you.
The Arab spring has a new, uncertain Situation created, and whether you want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
However, there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate finally come to an end.
A war that neither lost nor won
At first glance it seems to optimism in the face of the current location is everything other than appropriate.
Even if the on 21. November agreed cease-fire stops, the week's fighting, the Hardened on both sides strengthened.
The leader of the Hamas, the Islamist movement that since 2007, the Gaza strip, controlled by, say, the Israelis pushed back, although its grouping of large losses recorded had.
Although several Hamas leader killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza strip in one of the desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet cooped up, it is Israel until now did not manage to destroy Hamas.
Actually wins the Hamas in the West Bank to that of the rival, the moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah controlled.
And the Hamas leaders could arrive at the conclusion that the time is on your side.
So, as Islamists in the Arab world are gaining influence, the Hamas powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional Power, once considered one of Israel's closest Muslim ally was, for the Hamas party taken - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic States of the Gulf.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic Crescent forms - from Lebanon in the North, where the militant group Hezbollah has the Power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren embossing before the Stürzung Bashar Assad could stand up to Jordan, where Hamas-allied to the king threaten.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim brotherhood, under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - which is by far the most populous and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has the balance of the Region changed in the long term.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular Despot, Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years reigned, had only a little time for Hamas left.
In contrast to this, the brotherhood with Hamas to any of their leader more of Volksansichten dependent.
In future diplomatic negotiations could Hamas as an actor prove itself from Israel and the United States is not expelled.
The Israeli hard-liners, on the other hand, an opposite conclusion.
Militarily speaking, the Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli anti-missile defense system, "Iron Dome", prove themselves, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel is a peaceful sleep.
In diplomatic ways, the United States is holding steadfast to their Position. Many European countries have the Hamas for the latest escalation of violence; instead held responsible.
Israel, it is in recent years fared well, in particular, under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, of the peace process, in large part ignored.
Though the rockets from the Gaza strip since 2004 about 30 Israelis have been killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers stayed - not least thanks to the barriers in the West Bank and in the body of an eventual Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements, for contravention of international law were explained, however, always to be further developed.
Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party in the run-up to the elections on 22. January under Avigdor Lieberman, with a still kämpferischeren group allied.
Why this deceitful Palestinians coddle them and give them a state of their own forces?
If you are actually in control of the West Bank, you would then not exactly like their counterparts in the Gaza strip also firing missiles?
No, it is better for you behind the wall to hold at Bay and to punish, you should dare, the heads up.
Maybe the hard-liners can enforce. But the Arab spring could give you a stroke by the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who is now in Egypt and in other countries of the Power seats, little for Israel left, first on the difficulties in their own country focus.
The defense budget of Israel is greater than its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments are hardly in the repair of your business to help.
The pragmatic President Mursi with Barack Obama teamed to a cease-fire to reach, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new Era symbolize.
Also, Israelis should long-term thinking.
While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratization taking, Palestinians continue their right of national self-stripped - a powder keg, which is no doubt one day in the Israeli-occupied territories to explode, just as this week, a Bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The suppression undermines already now the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this Situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to defeat Hamas in the Gaza strip over the years increasingly their diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is that, of the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper is represented: Two States, in which Israel to enhance security areas to resign.
For the near future is small hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence to the enforcement of this solution is given.
Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar, the supply of weapons into the Gaza strip to stop and is better positioned than ever before to the Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
Outsiders Arab Nations should also Hamas and Fatah to an agreement to move.
This would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the upcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must do its part to contribute to Israel to negotiate to move.
During his first term, he failed the presentation of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he is just a participation averse.
But, this is unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
