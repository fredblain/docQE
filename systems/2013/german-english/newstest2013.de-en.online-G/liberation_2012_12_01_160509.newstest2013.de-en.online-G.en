While Egypt in relation to the constitutional Declaration that it will temporarily unlimited power of attorney granted, more than ever, remains divided, he has decided, all on one card.
To the Surprise of all, he has on Wednesday announced that the constituent Assembly the next day, its final version will adopt.
Just a week had the head of state this plenary two additional months for the completion of his Work is granted.
Egypt relies now for almost two years on a temporary basis, several times amended Text, which the institutional stability weakens and to a legal mess.
This new Initiative has only to an even greater division of the country and taken care of.
For his opponent remains the President in his "autocratic Delirium", by he continues, "his word breaks," and "the right with feet".
On pages of its advocates assures you that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible to end and the process of Transition to accelerate.
Within 14 days should a Referendum be held.
A very short period of time, the brothers forces, on your intention to renounce the Egyptians, the Text section by section to explain.
For the President, it is also a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, to find, during the Protest throughout the country is raging.
According to assertions in an Interview with the American newsreel Time seems Mohammed Mursi convinced that the Egyptians favorably votes.

85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent Assembly have the Text yesterday in a strange atmosphere was adopted.
The majority of the liberals is that the demand is not complied with.
Shortly before the constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have turned away, because you are of the opinion that they are not able to have their views to the full.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities and civil society alike have acted.
To achieve the quorum were yesterday Morning in haste to 11 persons, Deputy members, added.
Some are Moslembrüdern very close.
It is not surprising that the article mostly unanimously adopted.

The Text that yesterday in the evening is adopted, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 all the attention, remains, finally, is identical to the Constitution of 1971, and States that "the principles of the Sharia is the main source of Law".
The Salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic Law, an important requirement is that had the hope that "the principles" by "the rules" to replace what a stricter application would have made.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, a proof of their good will and for their respect towards the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" reciprocate the liberals, this is only a Propagandaschlag view.

They have particularly article 220 in the eye, of the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role to play, particularly in relation to the Verification of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia.

You can herein, the first signs of a theocracy, see".
The fears of the liberals are also of the fact that fueled the next rector of this University, far less moderately as the present should be.
"There is currently no specific religious commitment to detect.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers in this Text have worked, are not Ulema, but academics, the part of the French System have been trained", appeased Alexis Blouet, a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.
However, he admits that "in relation to the article 220 an ambiguity can be present, because the terms used in the religious vocabulary borrowed from.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic law, the editor d. Ed.].
And in the future, the question might be raised as to the extent to which Zivilrichter are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect of the yesterday Text adopted strong because of its far-reaching powers criticized, he is the President of the Republic granted.
The Moslembrüder argue that these are compared with the former Regime considerably reduced.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military is the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to the Parliament, but a national defense Council.
Likewise, there is no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights had demanded.
