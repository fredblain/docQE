In an ever-electrified the world, it is nice sometimes to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems that failed and we are on a different plane had to wait.
So I had enough time to get me a couple of thoughts about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
A half-day at the airport on a flight to wait, is pretty annoying, even if the books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free Shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and Kindesentwicklungsexperten lead to boredom as something Positive.
If it is after you, it is for us and our children - okay, occasionally get bored.
So the brain is forced to engage in interesting thoughts to lose, potentially resulting in the creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost all the time on one or the other screen rigid, come to us the advantages of the boredom of not more benefit.
We should boredom so with open arms to welcome?
Yes.
And no.
I'll be back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, the increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) that it is not seen.
"In fact, the boredom of a very long story," he says.
The walls of Pompey is decorated with a Latin Graffiti, boredom, to the first century back.
And then there is the question of how we boredom actually define.
John D. Eastwood, an associate Professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, according to the Problem consists in the fact that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long reading of literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people came Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, "a satisfactory activity to want, but not to be able to" define.
Boredom is different from apathy, consequently, to the effect that the Person is not employed but would like to be.
At the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key lesson of boredom, he says, is a "disorder of the Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that the time slowly passes by".
Boredom can almost sound like Depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two States could relate to, to see the bored people the Problem in your environment or the world, while those who are depressed the Problem in see themselves.
Sometimes, we believe that us is boring, even if we only have difficulties to concentrate.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", in English: "The idle mind: The Definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science" was published, assign Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on a previous Experiment, the participants a Band to listen to, to which a Person is a Magazinartikel read.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room, nothing to do with the content had to do. Others heard it on low volume, so it is hardly noticeable, while the third group this sounds at all not heard.
The people, the hardly audible television heard, said, more boredom than the other two groups to feel - you had problems, focus, and could for no reason, and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to be a difficult or strenuous task focus, the disorder of attention lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate Professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
If you are a monotonous activity "as the search for faulty products on a Fabrikförderband, music can distract your attention and help, not to be bored to feel".
In fact, he says, we now know that flounders about and Scribbling, often as a sign of boredom interpreted, even to fight against by persons physically attentive to stay.
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln may, to learn more and more to retain information than those for sitting still be forced," said Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually get bored of my delayed flight, a boomed speaker, a particularly tedious Film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
These differences to measure, developed by researchers in the 1980s, a "scale Langeweileanfälligkeit".
On the scale, in statements such as "Lots of things I need to do repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys more often boring than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, what is the need for more and a wider variety of external stimuli.
But, in General, Teenagers are a pretty abgespannter pile.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an Experiment in which he almost 400 Teenagers and their parents seven to eight Times a day with a Pager contacted.
He found out that 32% of the Adolescents in school and when you Do the homework were bored, while 23% said bored to be, if you were not at school.
However, only 3% of the parents stated that bored to feel.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages regarding the boredom has risen or fallen.
He was sure, however, that "the youth as a particularly boring perceived", mainly because of the children and Teenagers not have much influence on their Alltagsablauf.
So back to my original question is: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to extreme physical risks to take and the gambling or drugs expire, in order to alleviate studies have shown.
On the other hand, examine many philosophers and writers of the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich on the subject for more than two decades researching.
"With the boredom wants the brain will tell you that you have something else to do," said Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what you do best.
When bored, and this energy is used to playing the guitar and cooking, you will be happy.
But television can in the short-term for happiness, worry, this evaporate, but in the long again.
Who his bored child, so an iPad enough, it can thus be bored dissuade. It has not, however, learned how to entertain yourself or control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one Situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas, more self-control.
I don't think we boredom celebrate.
Also, we should not be too critical.
Instead, it should be our aim, and we are off to the constant activity and Technologieberieselung feel at home.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"It sounds as if we are frequently to be boring. But boredom is the nagging, unceasing desire to do something Useful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment In which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to be engaged, if the noise once silenced."
