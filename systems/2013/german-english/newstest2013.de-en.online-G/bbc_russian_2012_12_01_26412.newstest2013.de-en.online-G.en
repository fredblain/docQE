In the past few days it came anywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and Restaurants popular Fast-Food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests still continuing to swell, or whether you again soon running out of breath.
The protests by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations supported.
In addition to the modest increase in the wages of simple Walmart - and Fast-Food workers pursue the organizers of the protests that aim to form trade unions.
So far this sector of the economy hardly unionised.
46 Cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, the USA sales took place, the millions of customers anlockten, which was sometimes to the Handgemengen led.
On this day, put some Walmart employees, of which it is globally 2.2 million, your work down, and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target group is people in low and middle income.
Walmart sells all the products, diapers about hunting rifles, and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores is, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, buy many of the slightly paid Walmart employees at the workplace.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics, Walmart the goods are often the only reason why so cheap to sell, because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of severe working conditions, for example, lack of forklift truck or hand-held scanners.
The participant of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their Anger about the contribution to the company's own health insurance from 30 to $ 100 a month had increased.
A typical Wal-Mart employees, the 9.5 U.S. Dollar an hour deserves, could this increase can't afford it, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if the company the average wage on 12 Dollars an hour, it Walmart 3.2 billion Dollars would cost.
These are approx. 1,1% more than now for wage donations.
Would Walmart increases are completely on the customer to kill cost of each purchase you will only 46 cents more.
Per year would be for you in comparison to today expenditure of only 12,39 Dollars.
Proponents of Walmart provide satisfactory, that it is only in nine States to protests and this the company no losses brought.
The Black Friday took in his Shop from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cash on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an Interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that, overall, "fewer than five" Walmart employees the work down and the action of protest is "just another PR Trick" of the Union, the protests organized, had been.
"Free Cash!"
The protests went this week in New York, where your aim is not, however, Wal-Mart stores (in this advanced city not desired and, therefore, so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-priced Restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sell a billion servings, and yet you have no sick time, and you will for your honest work is not paid!

Currently, the minimum wage in accordance with Federal and New York legislation at 7.25 Dollar an hour.
In Fast-Food Restaurants is the minimum wage gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, get your easy employees in New York 8,90 U.S. Dollar an hour.
Less than you deserve no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible, in New York with a little money to get along, is beyond me.
There was once a time in almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's behind the counter stood, however, the young people lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income, or planning a longer stay there.
Now meet me in Interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that you pay to get along, and sometimes even their children to feed.
On the other hand, there are in the Forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal published a comment, whose author points out, it was irresponsible to have children, if you do not know, how you want to eat it.
The participants of the protest on Thursday at 6 : 30 in the morning in front of the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashier and chefs of Fast-Food Restaurants, a minimum wage of US $ 15 the hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage corresponds to.
They demanded to continue the formation of trade unions in the Fast Food industry.
U.S. law prohibits the corporate governance, this is an objective way to stand and trade Union activists warn or to dismiss.
On the other hand, the corporate governance, it is not easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the Fast Food industry, but also for objective reasons difficult.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Dissatisfied
The loud protests, there was on this day in front of many other Fast-Food Restaurants in Manhattan.
The peak of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats languages, including Stadtratsmitglied Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's says it will sell a billion servings, and yet you have no sick time, and you will for your honest work is not paid!"
The protesters were also of other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, BÃ¼rgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together in the Fast-Food employee support, so you can just receive wages and economic prosperity can reach every New Yorkers deserve!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US-American Fast-Food industry.
However, there were only a few Hundred people on the ground, of which by Far not all the Fast-Food industry in New York tens of thousands of work.
Still, it is not clear whether the spark of these protests whole mass will mobilise.
