Szabo: "Germans have a larger role to play"
Germany has in the vote on the admission of the Palestine of the voice.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, poised Berlin on a narrow diplomatic degrees.
Deutsche Welle: in the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it is against the application for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations would agree.
But then contained Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports, what the Israelis in Gaza have done, not.
Now Germany is due to its special relationship with Israel, however, to be careful.
But at the same time, I think, that it is also not the American Position is supported.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without, however, is critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstain, as it was a matter of a no-fly zone to be set up.
This was finally a NATO-enforced.
It falls Germany hard, on major international issues a clear Position to take?
Yes, that's true.
The reason is that it is just his foreign policy surrounded and while away from a policy, so to speak, of the United States managed, to a German foreign policy.
Complicating this is the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans found between the fronts against.
You are expected by you that you have a more independent role to play, because they are not accustomed.
I think you keys to their role approach, but you are on the way to a more ' normal ' foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or the UK.
What does a ' normal ' foreign policy concretely from the German point of view?
It shows the willingness of national interests, positions, to relate to, which are independent of those of the us or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy of the economic policy is motivated, so of exports, and its relationship to specific regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from that of the other great powers, and therefore, Germany has its own interests to protect.
These economic interests impact on the attitudes in the middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be wary of the Public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, not from the head to come across.
This is definitely a role.
But I would not be too much weight to do, this is not entirely one-sided relationship.
But it is definitely an important role in German Considerations.
Germany has its relations with the United States corrupted by it in making important decisions of the voice contain, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think, in Europe and even in the USA there is great understanding for the German Position.
Therefore, I do not think that this is such a dramatic break was, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps, therefore, Germany is even a certain respect for import.
Because it indicates, however, that it as an international player to be taken seriously, and his interests have to be considered.
In Europe, there are different opinions on the Palestinian Initiative.
The United States, by contrast, have clearly for a Veto pronounced.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European Nations?
Due to the American domestic politics have these differences will always exist.
I think that the Obama administration secretly probably pretty much understanding for the European Position.
But due to the political Situation here, can the government Position publicly, of course, is not represented.
I believe that the actual differences are not so great as they appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so thrilled by Netanyahu's policies.
It falls Germany hard, its close relations with Israel and the us on the one hand, and the Position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side to agree?
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy would be, which is not currently the case.
So you can't be part of a broader line and must instead things from their own Position going forward.
Do you precisely with the Euro.
I think, in the future, Germany will play a leading role in Europe a European Position to push.
This is of course not just for Germany, because of the relationship to Israel.
That was always a delicate topic.
But I believe that the German it is clear that a more independent role to play.
Looks Germany itself in the role as a major international player wants to Germany play a major role?
Or falls Germany, the Leadership still hard?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and, for obvious reasons, it falls to the country is still struggling, a greater role to play.
If we, for example, the Euro is to look at, because every Time when Germany play a greater role accepts a variety of anti-German feelings freely.
This makes it the Germans were not easy.
This is actually the old Problem: you don't want by hostile countries surrounded.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult Position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Now, the influence of the USA in European politics continues to decline, the EU fills in the Moment of this vacuum but not, who remains as otherwise?
The Germans will be easy to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like, it you uncomfortable and you have a lot of unpopular power - c'est la vie!
