"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have with PSG a new extent.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be through a personal insight, but also by the new Dimension of the PSG explain.
Great players have come.
Every day I'm on your side to progress.
The technical staff has also given much.
These items will inspire me every day to my level of play to improve.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very quickly.
But I break not in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I always have gradually made progress.
You do so by Carlo Ancelotti, introduced competition advantage...
The new signings this summer are accustomed to games at very high level assistance.
You also know that each training session is crucial.
This leads to the fact that a player like me, the forehead has to offer and want to do the Best.
By the way, I Carlo Ancelotti much in terms of my position.
He is Co-trainers such as Claude Makelele supported in the same Position played as I do.
Is Ancelotti is the right Person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills all technicians respect.
In Ligue 1, there are currently no comparable Person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has many titles with prestigious Clubs won.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he is in Paris for more win a title.
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just returned from a Verletzungsserie recovered.
The confidence he placed in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon us the place of the Spitzenreiters taken.
We lurking but in the ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have in this way qualified for the knockout stages.
What is the aim of the Association in this competition?
We will try, as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will be against a very good European teams, our say.
First of all, we want to first of our group in front of Porto, so we have the second leg of the Achtelfinales home game sweep.
The PSG in the short term, a major European club?
He already has the Budget for it...
To a big European club, Paris title win in the long term to make a name.
Today this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is the means for this project concrete shape.
It would be a big failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 win, like in the last season was the case?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really at the heart of this title prices.
In the last season, we were close.
In may, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win outright.
We have the season with a very strong performance of the terminated.
We have with 79 points completed.
Normally you should get with 79 points to be masters...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title of the rings, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media too much from the PSG expect?
In light of what has been invested and the players that we have, is it normal, that much is expected of us.
We accept completely.
However, when we are at a home game against Troyes 4-0 win, and you still find something you accuse us, this is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try a game concept to establish.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have strength proved.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons creates, for the next round of qualifying, and also the huge spending!
In terms of the invested sums believed you to break with 15 points ahead!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, in the last season were not good, were of this new PSG "geboostet".
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we in the month of may, the smiling winner will be, and tell us that we, despite all the difficulties, finally won.
The PSG seems to be completely different from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be dependent.
So much the better, that one of a "Zlatan-dependence" speaks.
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and has a lot of scoring goals.
That is why he came, and he proves that he is the Star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the players and the Person.
He respects also the people, who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This motivates the Other, your level of play to improve.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defender, it allows all Others to make progress.
As you will have the Euro 2012 with the French national team experienced?
As a disappointment.
It was close to my heart, at this EM participate.
Unfortunately for me, my injury prevented from some playing time out.
I have seen things, from which I emerged strengthened am.
Today, I succeed, good matches in the national team to achieve.
This was since my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what Ukraine has happened, we have our lessons, and today we have an exemplary behavior of the day.
What is your opinion on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has promising results achieved.
We have a good Position in the selection for the world Cup.
The national coach is strict, is available to the players close and encourages us to victory.
As Laurent Blanc was.
But I would like to no comparison.
Blanc had reached his goal, by joining us for the EM qualified.
I hope that Didier Deschamps the "Bleus" after Brazil.
Is on the 16. October in Spain forced a draw (1:1) an opening match?
This game has given us Confidence.
Everyone has for all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never been a similar game in my career experience.
