Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The Globetrotter of basketball, Hector "Hetin" Reyes was the Korbsport for more than 60 years and has traveled all over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before it by a stroke in 2008, wheelchair bound, was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, whether it be as a player with the lower classes, players of the first national League, a representative and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketballverbands.
"Throughout my life I have me in Basketball many hats set up, even several at the same time, as I am President of the BSN, chief Executive of the national team and President of the Association in the 90s was," recalled Reyes, during a visit by Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he is with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years, resides.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all photos and memories of his long career decorated and testify.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who believe in his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as a player until 1982 remember where he has his 15-year anniversary as co-managing Director or managing Director of the club was celebrated.
"Those were the best years of my, I most enjoyed, because I'm part of eight Championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, it was as managing Director, co-managing Director or Trainer to be allowed.
There were a lot of fulfilling years, including five Championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut album by Jerome Mincy BSN.
From then took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who is a very good Manager was," says Reyes.
I still do that to me genes Bartow, as a Trainer and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was employed, said: "I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.
Do You want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow recommended after the Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, naturalised and let one of our best pitcher was.
I remember how he said that, if Mincy a championship for Bayamon allows had Gausse for a more would be taken care of.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance out, because in 1988 he already at the top of the Union state.
At this time he moved it in front of, its enforcement, and the Mincy in the national team to enjoy.
I remember, when we for the first Time when vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States won.
Then came the world Cup in 1990, when the fourth place is occupied, what actually Bronze would have meant to be, if not this canadian referee would have been in the us for the last turn, for the second Time to repeat left, said Reyes.
This group was the world Cup in 1990, the best national team, which you've ever seen?
It is one of the Best, as well as those at the 2004 Olympics against the " Dream Team", won.
My favorite is the team of the pan-American games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won Gold and the Team of the USA a fight offered, as at that time, as you may have against us in the world Cup Bronze won.
In that team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, the 1990 due to a knee injury, could not be there.
A team, perhaps in terms of personalities was not the Best, but we won a gold medal and the us great joy, those of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events on the pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won contrary to forecast the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His Numbers on the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico on this level as dominant as Piculín.
And this, without his career in the different leagues to take into account, in which he has played.
Who was the best trainers from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a couple of good Trainer, such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the Best thing you in the Federation have reached?
I was part of the most successful Era, the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in a season included.
What remains for you to do?
There are things I would have introduced such. Example, the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The guys in Ponce z. B. only in their field of play and only in the national Playoffs to the teams from different corners of the island meet.
Today, the children have many unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are You doing today?
I love to listen to music, see Videos from the music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who is always at my side.
