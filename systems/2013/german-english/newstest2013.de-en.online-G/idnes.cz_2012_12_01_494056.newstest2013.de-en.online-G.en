The repeal of the law on non-profit Work is not a solution.
In the last week highlighted the constitutional court the law on non-profit Work.
This decision called for in the Public a lively discussion.
It is interesting that the problem from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect this means that the individual national economies in a state of permanent conflict.
Reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of the Privatkapitals, with the rampant financial speculation goes Hand in Hand.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) it comes to Preisspannungen.
Under this term is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying, through the importation of cheaper Goods in the economic competition by the competition "undercut", and thus a larger share of the market to usurp and its profit increase.
On a large scale, this means that most of the companies, their production abroad to transfer or buy low, or your business to give up. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labour costs.
Since the private capital is no social responsibility, and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused carries rise necessarily government spending.
This Situation is strengthened by the fact that the men entrepreneurs absolutely're reluctant to pay your tax and thereby caused by them wider economic and social damages.
This Situation is commonly known, so that concrete statistics at this point, are superfluous.
The ruthless practice of Privatkapitals creates in the individual economies, a Situation in which the governments will be forced to compete with each other to come to the social level of the population artificially reducing foreign capital into the country to attract.
With other words: The governments of supply its own population without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is reflected, in particular, Changes in applicable laws.
The aim of these measures, it is its own population to force the dictates of the Privatkapitals in particular in the wage sector have to accept.
This happens by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other, by the circumcision of workers ' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-larger differences between the Poor and the rich.
In Germany, there are already several years in public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for arms, which no longer are able, through their work to feed.
The number of those Affected is already in the millions.
In the course of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy it regularly to cases in which workers such low wages that the state your income up to the subsistence wage increase.
Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employees assistants revealed.
The austerity measures, virtually all of the EU southern States will undoubtedly be on the same condition as result, the people are under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as it is in the 19. Century was the case), or for a pittance at the edge of society to starve and to hope that at some point private investment capital to flow into the country.
Here is urging naturally, the question of how this capital comes?
If it is from another EU-country, migrates only the poverty of a country to another; or the capital remains the same, quite, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa work at all, the workers for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam, that the state is not with capital to its own economy involved, and that planned to Wirtschaftskatastrophe.
Private capital insists narrow-minded on his point of view, that the state is not directing in the economy allowed to work.
Then you have to ask yourself whether or not the private capital of the policy and thus the entire state in its own selfish purposes influenced or even directs.
Here is the definite answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practical Almighty and in all States ubiquitous Lobby.
The result is a desperate Situation in the area of corruption, the mutual preference, a law in which virtually all reprehensible, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany the Situation is such that a Ministry of state for lack of finances private, closely with the industry interwoven Rechtsunternehmen with the elaboration of draft laws commissioned.
These draft laws are then in the Parliament.
All violence is then no longer from the people, as it is the Western constitutions proclaim, but of strong financial groups, which have their own interests prefer.
Obviously advised the liberal democracies currently quickly in a Situation such as that Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in times of Caesar and Pompey' describes: "The state has long been in decay terms, and the Offices were with violence occupied.
Against bribe, unlawful procuring of benefits, or with stone and sword.
The corruption rampant uncontrollably, and the people went with already purchased voices to choose" ... "people with character competed not for Offices, so that the government as a result of this decline in eight months, no Consul had" ... "You began really to talk about, that is the only medicine in this difficult Situation-a dictatorship, and that a strong man to be elected must be"... Appian thought at Pompey, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, the democracy permanently by the dictatorship replaced.
As it turns out, is based today's society, as well as in ancient times on the reckless preference of one's own advantage, and without the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is already by its nature is not in the position to the benefit for the whole of society to recognize and enforce them.
The result, today, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, not in the Least to more in-depth reform effort.
The cause for the emergence of fascism and communism, we must therefore, in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. Century look.
From the present state of view, can be the downfall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies as a certain Pause to be considered at the next round already emerging.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites in future possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, humanitarian and social disasters, we witness today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we are from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit Work here is not a solution, at least not lasting.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition will the Czech Republic be forced to continue ways to search, to the social level of the population to press down.
This Trend is therefore due to the system.
The only solution are targeted political and social reforms which the equity participation of the state in the economy, increasing the influence of the citizens on the government to increase and the monopoly position of the Privatkapitals in the society in favour of the state of weaknesses.
