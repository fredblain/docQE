The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court, the Law on charitable work.
This decision in the public a lively discussion.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with one another.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, with rampant speculation goes hand in hand.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) price tensions.
Under this concept is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to pass through the importation of cheaper goods in economic competition, the "offer" competition, in order to grab a bigger share of the market and to increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their manufacturing abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Private capital because no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rise in unemployment caused, the state spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the men are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and to replace the overall social, economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital into the economies of a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is forcing its people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
This is done by economic duress in long-term unemployment, by limiting the rights of workers.
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there for several years, public Lebensmittel levy for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people who are already in the millions.
In the wake of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy are cases in which workers get such low wages that the state to increase their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of the German Bundestag auxiliary staff employed.
The austerity of practically all EU-South will undoubtedly run into the same state where people are under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century, it was the case), or for a pittance left to languish on the margins of society, and to hope that at some point, private investment capital is flowing into the country.
Nature here is the question of where the capital?
If it is from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains completely, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, the employees are working for a fraction of the wages of Europe.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam that the State should not capital on its own people, economy, and that the economy will lead to economic disaster.
Private capital narrow insists on its position that the state is not allowed to directly intervene in the economy.
Then you have to wonder whether or not the private capital, the politics and the entire state in its own selfish sense or even.
Here is the unequivocal answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual unmistakably, legislation is practically everything, but nothing criminally punishable by law.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department in the absence of private finance, dense with industry interrelated law firms charged with drafting legislation.
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag.
All the violence is not more popular as Western constitutions, but strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies have been fast in a situation like the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey ': " the state has long been in decay, and the offices occupied by force.
Against bribes, illegal Erschleichung of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption has grown unchecked, and the people with already bought votes for the election, "... " people with character applied for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul "... " it began to really talk about it, that is the only medicine a rule in this difficult situation, and that should be a strong man "... Appian thinking at Pompey, but the strong man was Caesar, democracy permanently replaced by the one-man rule.
As it turns out, today's society is based, as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, not paying attention to the overall interests of society.
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to see the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, now as then, is one of the decadence of the elites, not the slightest concern for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we must look at the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The current state of affairs, the downfall of this regime can be seen as a certain pause in favor of liberal democracies, in the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites to the possible future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, which we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is no solution, at least not lasting.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition in the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to find ways to reduce the level of social security of the population.
This trend is therefore system.
The only solution is a targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital into the company in favor of the state.
