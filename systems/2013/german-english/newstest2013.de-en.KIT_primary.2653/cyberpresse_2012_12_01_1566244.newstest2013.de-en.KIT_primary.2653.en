The Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs-Bosons has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that the Boson is nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle predicted by the Standard Model - our best or the least wrong " explanation of the nature and behavior of matter whose existence - but not empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs Boson is very similar.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data were presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data yet to be completely secure.
We assume that it is indeed the Higgs is deceiving, because apparently only a low risk, and let us look at what is at stake.
In this world, there is an inevitable standard law meant that two objects can be both at the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule, and try not to, because you are hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a really weird world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same quantum state ", a " condition " on the whole, consists of some of its properties.
The physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are good citizens, who are known as fermions and suddenly obey the Pauli principles.
And in the other, the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, whom nothing is sacred, not in any case, this principle, which means that they are, in fact, at the same time, at the same place.
These bosons are divided according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the meso, we will not deal with the "force particles", the great forces of nature, and which would be the Higgs Boson, somehow.
However, it must be stressed that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this history, it is only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the photon, or light particles, " this is the " messenger " of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge faster or change the direction of the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" at this place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbing" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "bearers of the force."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs field, "disrupted" must be the Boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen can reach very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, with a surface that could be a very large rocks spall.
That is why a giant particle accelerator is needed - as CERN's Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve the kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
It is not, in fact, all the particles and not all of the materials, which interact with the magnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - example of a sheet of paper would never think of themselves in the refrigerator.
And not all of the particles, the Higgs field: those who do interact, have a mass, while the others (such as the photon) have no mass.
What all this research can be "good", asks Ms Plamondon?
The review of the Standard Model (SM) for science, and they also enable physicists to examine all the discrepancies between the observations and predictions of SM.
There are many physicists hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference to open a door to a "new physics" and there might be some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter is still flawed, as it offers no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, about 80% of the matter of the universe (re-ups!).
However, CERN such deviations were not found until now.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population is difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the bell-labs would not suspect that their work such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (1962, were the first pulsed) has already said - that the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gimmick" in the beginning.
Imagine...
Applications can also result from all the instruments, surrounded by the research.
Example has developed, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969, during his work in optics, a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose of the sensor is now all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know....
