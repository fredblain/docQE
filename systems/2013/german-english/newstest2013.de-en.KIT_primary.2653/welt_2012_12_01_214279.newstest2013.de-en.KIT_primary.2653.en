The word ' lack of human rights in the Constitution "
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future Constitution of sharia as the basis is hotly disputed.
Egyptian President not sparing with pathos.
We must create the transition.
"And that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said in the State Fernsehen.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular fuels.
Because they all have, so far, hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a state of the Nile, God of Grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, almost apologized, Mohammed Morsi, temporarily curtailed the powers of the constitutional court and expanding its competences, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD in the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
In fact, Article 234 of Islamis table dominated the 100-member constitutional assembly in a nightly 15-hour Parforceritt pushed through, in part, worrying.
As in previous constitutions in the draft, the case law based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
That was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists, the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
At least, that a new article: guided in all matters affecting the Sharia should consult the Al-Azhar University, the country's main Islamic institution with great clout in the whole of Sunni Islam.
This does not, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which would be the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
The Verfassunsgsentwurf is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should be maintained.
These dishes served to the repression of opponents during Mubarak's rule.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11000 civilians in military custody.
The state should protect, as stated in the draft, " the true nature of the Egyptian family " and promote its morals and values. "
This is legally so unclear that state institutions, with the help of this article could even control the content of the film, art and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, no articles explicitly stipulates equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits insulting the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys or to slander.
But what is an insult, and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Equally questionable is the wording of the "insult to the people" is prohibited.
Here is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a law scholars?
Sizing thing, like so much in the design, Morsi to sign, and in his words, "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented to the people to vote.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition formed for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised the Charter, before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of presidential elections.
Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said, "the constitutional draft belong on the scrapheap of history."
Via text messaging service Twitter, he accused the Morsi supporters, "a" coup against democracy.
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and unseat him," said the opposition persuade Yasser Said.
"We are not yet tired of the blood of our brothers is not punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not supervise the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves on the counter-demonstration, to take precautions, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer from Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis took part, shouting "the people calling for the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi, "cleansing the country!" And protested: "the Koran is our constitution."
A battle for control of the emblematic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have led to civil war-like situation.
It did not want to risk of Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood, both opponents of the constitutional draft and supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights, not even"
Hafez Abu Saeda, is furious about this forced constitutional process, which would have until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
He was sentenced, beaten, imprisoned.
" And now is not the word of human rights in the new constitution, " he complained in the interview with the Welt am Sonntag ".
Morsi power extension to all three powers in the state of the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game, and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the president it de facto," laments Saeda.
A democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which considers the ideological direction of struggle on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could backfire.
A protestor in Tahrir warns: "you geb√§hrt a monster that you can't control."
