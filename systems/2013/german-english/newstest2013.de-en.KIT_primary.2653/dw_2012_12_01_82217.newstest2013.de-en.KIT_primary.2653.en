Szabo: " Germany must play a greater role '
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations in Berlin, balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to set up a flight ban.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
That is because it was precisely his foreign policy, away from a policy that were managed by the United States, a German foreign policy.
Worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are between the fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think they fumble their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have in France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy in concrete terms, from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests, which are independent of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different from those of the other great powers, to a certain degree, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why we must be careful not to alienate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role.
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic collapse in the Libyan issue.
Maybe Germany will even some respect.
It signaled that it should be considered as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States have called for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
These differences have always existed because of American domestic politics.
I believe that the Obama administration has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But due to the political situation, the government will not publicly, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they seem.
If the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so upbeat about Netanyahu's policies.
It is hard to reconcile Germany's close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side?
I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can be part of a wider line and instead have their own position.
They are currently using the euro.
I believe in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, that is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player, Germany's desire to play a major role?
Germany, or the leadership role it still?
Germany is not accustomed to that is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a greater role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because each time Germany assumes a greater role in various anti-German feelings.
It is not just the Germans.
This is the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics, the EU is currently not filled the vacuum, but who is?
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them, and they are much less popular, c 'est la vie!
