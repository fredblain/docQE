In a world constantly electrifying, it is nice to be bored
I spent this Thanks Giving unexpectedly five hours in the airport, as our plane because of mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts on boredom.
I will not lie.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping).
But more and more academics and child development expert boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us and our children - okay, sometimes bored.
The brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, which promotes creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly on a screen, rigid, the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back to this point.
How many people I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed, with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: a Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom in many ways been defined and discussed.
After a long reading of the research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that the experience, "to a satisfactory job boredom, but this does not define".
Boredom is different from apathy, therefore, that the person is not, but it would be.
The apathy, however, there is no desire to do something.
The key to the experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption to the attention of process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can listen to almost like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be linked to see bored people, the problem in their area or the world, while depressed people, the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that it is boring, even if we only have difficulty concentrating.
In their study, "the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention" - roughly translated: "the inert mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listen to a band, in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content of other heard it on low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group not heard these noises.
The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more boredom than the other two groups, they have had problems to focus on these could find no reason for their difficulties and wrote the boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate Professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
But if you put a monotonous work, "as the search for defective products at a factory conveyor belt, music can help and not get bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske.
We will all eventually get bored - my delayed flight, a booming loudspeakers, a particularly shun dull, tedious film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s, a range of Langeweile vulnerability. "
On the scale are statements such as "many things that I have to do to repeat themselves and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly on the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But, in general, teenagers are a bunch of pretty slack.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and Gemeinwesens development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and perform the tasks, while 23% said to be bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said that they are bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages have risen about the boredom or dropped.
He was sure, however, that "the youth is regarded as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have a big impact on their daily lives.
So, back to my origin question: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people take extreme physical risks and all the happiness or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is Professor Vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain will say that we should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what we should do.
If it is boring and you use that energy to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy.
But the television in the short term for happiness, these feelings evaporate but in the long term.
Anyone who goes to his bored child an iPad, so it can distract from the boredom, but has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas, more self-control.
I do not believe that we should be celebrating boredom.
We should also not critical.
Instead, our aim should be to feel at home, away from the ongoing activities and drip irrigation technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people in truth only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly Ã¼berstimuliert, it is hard to look if the noise is muted."
