Born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of space vessels with people aboard on the search for a replacement planet.
In order to save the human race, the important question is, how we can reproduce microgravity or spare planet?
There are many choices, I do not believe it.
De facto, there are only two real planet we inhabit at least hypothetically.
"Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff of Sternberg Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are friendly way of life, on the surface of Venus is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The question of reproduction in space, the researchers first discussed in relation to the flora.
A half-century earlier experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of planted peas in orbit, not the least of the species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, tiny fruit fly (Drosophila) in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of the embryo.
It is a normal chicks.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chickens must stop; it must stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid surface, the wild chicks.
Ten hours later, the dull instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
Four days later she died.
"We have two chicks hatch and then the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," says Vladimir Sychew the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding kennel with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, in the Biosatelliten "Bion" only homosexual species.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilized sent into space.
In principle, it was nothing special.
"That was the Biosatelliten, but it was only a single experiment, and the research should be continued," remarked Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the space rats.
The issue of reproduction in space could not solve.
The task is difficult.
The animals out of their natural life, cannot simply follow their reproduction.
Unlike animals, humans could in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
Ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
Yet women fly into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk in Tereshkova.
The most precious that humanity is one of the female body.
Our gull flew, and no one on earth would be able to answer the following question: it survives the space flight?
After this flight, it will bring a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered the question," says space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, gave birth to the first female Soviet cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrija Nikolajew was astronaut.
In 1988, gave birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja was twice in orbit, and even work done outside of the space vehicle, a son.
Nevertheless, it remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut, a long flight, everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is for flights into orbit," concludes astronaut Valeryi Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The Hydro laboratory in preparation center of the Cosmonaut is an obligatory stop during the flight preparation.
Here in limbo, the cosmonauts routine for work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults water as pleasant, it is a strange surroundings, but babies water as a natural element.
It is the small Ichtyander bear witness to the fact that the life of the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit, water, and that it is easier to get used to the water.
In principle, it is only logical, given birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While the weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdomen and pelvic muscles rapidly, and thus the ability to extract the child.
Well, we deal with birth introductory tool.
The birth, for example, could also be held in a special chamber to squeeze the child.
"But then what happens?" Is the not insignificant matter of Valeryi Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung feel the organism is not the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn baby can be put in orbit, not as an adult for training in a burden.
He is just missing what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which will bring together, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled person, a completely inappropriate people to the world," says the head of the bioethics commission of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the universe theory.
At some point, but it will become reality if the earth in their space ships to a distant planet, which is home to the All-born offspring.
