The start of the course of studying the "end of the world"
Every week, students investigate apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, when the religion professor, decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long reverse counting" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place where the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not seen that this will be apocalyptic semesters, ever," said Charmé this week, students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
If someone is analysed what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalled that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor of this semester, which is supposed to be the last in history courses through the end of the world.
In Temple, the beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students investigate apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We will analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios that lead to a specific human behavior.
If nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists, example, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and how they compare in comparison with real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history, Matthew Restall and his colleague, Amara Solari, a beisitzende professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the name "the end of the world."
"We are not in 2012, so that we retain the option to re-hold the course, in the event that the world does not disappear," said Restall.
Despite the "impending doom" must create the students study projects and take part in exams.
In Penn State's final examination will be carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other option but to continue working "until the night of the world supposedly comes to an end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no seats," said Restall of its course for students with a high average, filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of term we received e-mails from students who were asked whether still seats available.
For its part, the students that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects or religion mentality is just a matter of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and health care to all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a classroom, where it will be informed," he admitted.
I enjoy it.
But none of the surveyed students - and even less a professor - said to believe in the final date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Maya and discredit in a particular way," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from Westchester.
The Maya never said the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that in the Western society is an apocalyptic fear back many centuries, when the people on changes in their environment, responded with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased speculation.
"Other places, not the people," he says.
This is particularly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Doug Herty, a religion professor at the University of La Salle, which this year in the Philippines, responded quickly to the question of whether he would be a course on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines is not at the end of the world," he wrote as an allusion to an exception to a higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years, many days, was the last court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people immediately think of a new date" or speculating about the December 21, the start of a seven-year period, which would be the end of the world.
Students and professors this date.
Several said that they want to go to "celebrate" the end of the world.
"Maybe I will call a few friends, so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
