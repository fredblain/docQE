Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am a Tory
Not only university students today attacked for her views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother had visited the university, which I thought was once the largest knowledge stamp in the world - for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester College in the late 1980s, I had intended to study history - I had packed my suitcase and the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I would have had a problem with fellow students in the adjacent room sex.
The author of A N Wilson impish explained, I would have to leave the university because I was forced to drink from a damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was bullied for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment: my late father now Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser of Margaret Thatcher and supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to latest reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week, the same Equal Treatment Directive, the protection of gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College, they are often actively isolated because of their political views, "personally attacked and declared undesirable."
They call for a place in the equal rights committee of college, to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation worsened by a recent documentary that radiates political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It was among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student union of the University of Oxford, who drove a Rolls-Royce and flaunts silver suit and silver occupied walking stick.
Other universities, conservative students say they are considered as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative Students Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: " there is a growing trend of links to universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, believes such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect of the conservative student association of Oxford says she watched with JCR, members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of its members," she says.
I was such a minority in my first weeks in Oxford.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old was reached in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education to any title.
The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester-week to get to know the new students and tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors mocking of Tory students not only tolerated, but even with joy took part.
Political issues such as the miners ' strike, privatisation and the rejection of the Government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa had found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
In the first of these events I French texts into English from the 18th century. What should I was not taken.
"Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "translate" the first paragraph.
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and rather be horrendous.
"Refuse Thatcher loyalists to learn French, or are you just stupid?" He asked me.
The other students giggled.
Wall tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a couple of French hours in your free time, so if you are not too preoccupied with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned with hanging heads in my room.
That evening, I sat alone in the college at the dinner when someone had typed lightly on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is the way it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be a Tory.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father, Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most of the Tory first semester, to be a supporter of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I tried later to distract me.
I insisted that I was not entirely with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A university entrants in philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, as a conservative force had attended Eton College, said to me: "you are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How Tories have sex?" One asked me.
The beating each other?
I felt so how homosexuals have felt the more liberal legislation in the United States.
I think it would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
I would be able to meet only after nightfall?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me, extended song to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who was openly as a Tory, Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
It was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy speeches and written for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and turned him down for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy," he said.
I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated, Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties of all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
It is something she would never do in my city of dreaming tower.
Even my communist friends presented impeccable manners.
Tarnished his moist eyes.
Give a chance.
I am sure you only teasing.
It would break my heart if you were walking.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had bowed to pressure to renounce his beliefs.
During a Tutoriums the following week, with a further serious history tutor had claimed I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly ashamed zerging, I admitted that my parents to undergo "brainwashing" and called them "old sucker."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who was the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors.
As they went, I was packing a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a whiny wimp.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory, but until now hidden behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
