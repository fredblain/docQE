The most difficult profession in the world: human labor animals of Kawah Ijen
Four euros for the winner of the Indonesian volcano of their lives and their health at risk, if they carry a 70 kilogram of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers, who earn their living by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It is a day to climb down on the floor of the crater, where the from the earth ausstr√∂mende sulphurous gas in contact with the air.
He has great sulphur broken stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths made of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 386 yards, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, and they need to keep the balance and careful steps to ensure that they do not slip and crash.
They know that each step can cost their lives as a French tourist, which crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The Kawah Ijen mine workers earn 5 cents for each kilogram of sulphur, dismantle them.
On top of the hill, they pave the path between the tourists and walk like circus monkeys with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, which has a mining company, a little below at an altitude of 1850 metres set
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (rather) is exploiting its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
They then sold for 10000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life, and is used for the manufacture of prank woods, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"As we normally receive 70 kg, for every way around 46000 rupees (3.8 euros)," explains us Anto, usually three lines a day.
He needs three hours, according to which he is completely done, at the end of the day, however 138000 rupees (11.5 euros) for each track.
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest 15000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day, and the average income this month of two million rupees (167), is very high," explains the winner, who had previously worked as a builder on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for a reason, which is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto for three years of his life on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur in him the first mark, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here two years, because I would like to open a shop or Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This friendly and intelligent, but given the life of a young man as a tourist guide, waiters or working at the reception desk of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wood shack with other carriers, and every morning at 2.00 a.m. because of the sulphur applying at night, where his distinctive yellow color bluish shines in the darkness.
The shadow of challenging it in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money into the crater.
About 400 winners are the baskets on the crater floor with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has mechanized the sulphur reduction in order to save costs, and the agencies that work on their own account and are paid according to weight, no equipment.
They also receive a share of 30000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the custodians of this nature parks, together with the entry of 15000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come for the shooting of the volcano and human Tragesel.
"This work is for the animals and does not work for the people" protesting Madrusin, a sturdy, 42-year-old winner of three decades since leaving the school at the Kawah Ijen.
He is able to accommodate up to 110 kg and assured that he is doing, "as long as it is," because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18 years of age.
I am not going to retire, I will die here because of the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and eyes itch, when the wind suddenly and can become trapped mine workers in the thick pillars rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses... except, of course, the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back is Unainik with its 53 years nurmehr 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are carried by three trucks on a goat path between the bushes on the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano has been all my life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth, in which some teeth are missing.
Working from his five children, the oldest man in his 30 years as a sulphur-makers.
Time passes, but the poverty keeps generation upon generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who work as human load donkey on Kawah Ijen.
