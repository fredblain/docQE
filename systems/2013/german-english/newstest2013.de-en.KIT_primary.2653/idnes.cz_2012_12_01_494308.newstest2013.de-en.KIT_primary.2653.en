Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"... nothing from violence, or ever could," sings the Sting song Fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons wanted no wars, no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a host of reactions.
The stand behind Israel and argue with the right to self-defense, while they support the Palestinians as terrorists; on the other hand, the Palestinians argue with the racism of the State of Israel, with the genocide perpetrated in the Palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point, I would not like to write about who these recurrent waves of killing guilty and who is the victim; in the end, today's residents of Israel, including the self-administrative areas were born in the current political situation and the beginning of the violence have not even seen.
It is open to the readers of the behind-the-scenes look who is 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the Middle East, particularly in the small parcels of land.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and from my own understanding of who or what group of people, a great influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can consider Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether there were always these figures themselves, independently of their steps, or whether someone behind her throne, their actions drew to a predetermined destination.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is less in the hands of individuals, and that the concentration of money and the resulting power is not within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomical stands rich families, which could be described as head of the octopus (I do not know whether anyone on them, but I do not agree - the Rothschilds.
Much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1890s, in order to prevent the combination of its name with high criminal acts in the background of the consolidation of its power, the propagation of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world's central banks and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they were wars, or are these (before the invasion of Afghanistan in 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were five countries after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, while Russia has in the meantime, its central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to counter this family had to pay with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds, Bank of America as the central bank began during the civil war, their own (read: state) notes and was assassinated in 1865, in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began handing out their own notes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, when he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global appetite for power led to the Rothschilds in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert spades, Freemasons in the 33 and the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at the big royalist European states to eliminate the second war, in particular, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and luxury and would not consume so many resources), to create a universal religion (the Ã–kumenismus here is nothing more than the first) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the head, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order) from chao - order out of chaos.
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve, so that crises like the one they created in 1907 not repeated).
It was by the murder of the Hapsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire through the revolution, the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Czarist Russia, the war was not necessary), then the dissolution of the Austria-Hungary's Central European superpower.
The Second World War, easier to bankers by the policy of creating a latent conflict by Germany with huge war reparations, they created the precondition of impoverished masses, so they had to keep palming the Germans just a sufficiently strong leader who offered the culprits named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should be the function of a fifth column and, in order to reignite the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds, initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, a branch of the establishment of a Jewish state, as in the historic area of Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital() return to Zion.
The aforementioned Balfour declaration laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was the first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler had the chain losriss, international bankers initially, or if all went according to plan, it is hard to assess, in any case, the plight of European Jews in the concentration camps, the precondition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and was, as well as by the war reparations against Germany, preparing the ground for the Second World War, the creation of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If international bankers to unleash this war, the Jewish people will like in World War II, the victims in the front line of battle, this time with the Arab and Muslim populations in the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply divided the people of supporters and opponents of Israel.
Who is the culprit, and who was the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only in an endless spiral of violence, while at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
It is important to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, but the international bankers in Israel as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism vulnerable to international bankers loyal dutiful politician is doing everything possible to start a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), could rapidly develop into a global conflict, and where, because of Iran's control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies could lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In light of the fact that the words of David Rockefeller's 1994: "the only thing we need is a major crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In its presentation is the new world order, a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn in the birth of a chip implanted in order to subdue the essence of total control.
" And it makes the kids and the adults, the rich and the poor, the Free and all the servants, a malt oak in their right hand or on your forehead, that no one can buy or sell it because the malt oaks, the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is a wisdom, anyone who has brains, the number of the beast.
It is a human figure, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six. "
