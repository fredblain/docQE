A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leadership forces justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, of the Brennan Center for the latter is a myth, confirmed that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The law, lawyers, the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: the new rules will negatively affect the turnout.
In this sense, these measures are part of the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US federal states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, announced new laws, the procedures for the registration and the ballot box.
This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which the new Republican leaders in 26 states.
As a result, 180 law drafts were introduced in 2011, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of the US State of citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shortens the time periods for the early vote, the right to void the election day to register as voters, and State denied citizens the right to vote, for which a court file.
Before the elections of 2006, no US state has asked voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first federal state, which has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed that the constitutional law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, fostered in 34 states, federal law drafts, which forced the voters to produce a photo ID.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, 21 million voters people no photo ID card issued by a governmental authority of their state.
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, often pay more than a hundred dollars to get the required identification.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected low-income young people, minorities and people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with an income of less than $35000, 18% of people over 65 years, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes further.
The students, who are seen as voters increasingly cast their vote for Democratic candidates, it is not allowed in several states to use their from their establishment issued photo ID.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting, more for the Republican side of the cards issued by these clubs to use for elections.
Before 2004, a federal state, has called for dialing a proof of the State of citizenship.
Arizona was the first federal state, introduced such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their US state citizenship.
These measures clearly are intended to limit the Hispanic votes.
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted in 2011 in eight federal states laws with the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups, those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
Example of the campaigns to register voters in the general election in 2004 helped to register some 10 million state citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other federal states, which aim to shorten the period for early voting.
Examples were in the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the federal state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the White, 76% of voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several drafts law were blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
Example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the submission of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics point to the partisan nature of the laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the crucial states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted such laws, 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that the legal provisions of these changes to the electoral system have a significant impact on the outcome of presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the turnout.
In this sense, these measures are part of the democratic system of the United States.
