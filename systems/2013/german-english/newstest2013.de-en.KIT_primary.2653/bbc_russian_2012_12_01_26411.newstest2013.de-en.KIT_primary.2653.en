Interior Ministry ignored illegal arms market
An extremely small percentage of legal weapons in crimes
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the arms law for private gun owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the shooting of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police wants to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in the public and the age for owning firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee on security and combating corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will shortly be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities to combat the problems with "attraction of the screws."
The Internet was published an open letter, the author, representatives of various weapons associations - by the authorities of "senseless improvements".
The percentage of crimes registered weapons is very low, the Strafrechtler, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes were committed with the use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while 1.168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals to serve on the black market.
Nowadays you can, according to the authors of every possible weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to officers
The weapons on the black market through multiple channels.
There are five main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.

The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen from both the Russian military officers, as well as Caucasians," says Baranez.
On the second channel illegal weapons, the regulatory guardians are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that include weapons, both stolen from armouries police directly by members of the criminal persecution.
Other illegally sold arms from military arsenals.
In many military camps often led to explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases, arson was to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Contribute to the black market, according to Baranez the arms manufacturers.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories which do not stand up to international competition and therefore the weapons in the hands on the black market in Moscow," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes artisanal production and a mafia, organized the smuggling," says the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels to supply the black market in illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report has been compiled by the Center for problem analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Interior Ministry and the Federal Service for National Statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of arms.
The vast majority of illegal weapons from the army and the right protection authorities, according to investigators.
Half of all weapons on the black market are channelled through the fault of the people responsible for their work with weapons, " the report says.
The data, according to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% of thefts of weapons production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A sales adviser of a weapons store, which does not want to be named, assured that weapons found in illegal excavations, nobody buys anymore, because they are out of date.
According to him, it is more that traders get supplies in a weapons warehouse.
A Ensign bought a weapon, a pistol type TT.
The weapon will be issued and delivered through the fence.
"The dealers brings the weapon in the city and sold it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know about everything and, therefore, if they do not comply with the plan for the detection of crime, periodically checks by purchases from distributors who offer illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"As the luxury stores"
Buyers and sellers find each other on the most famous.
I had seen Web sites and blogs, as someone who has been attentive to me, and I suggested to the station, "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me, I would be in a place where we could then negotiate the price.

"In order to get a gun, I need a friend, who has contacts," says the sales consultants. "I have a friend, but I do not trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go and arrange with a code as "Ivan Iwanowitsch, that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am currently even some shot rings on a friend whom I trust.
It gives me the blow rings just because he knows that I do not verpfeife.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldiers, Viktor Baranez dabbled in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject.
The scheme has not changed him.
He got a photo album, "everything".
"I felt like the luxury store," recalls the military personnel.
The buyer gets, according to Baranez not a pig in a poke, but you can try everything.
I buy a potential customer, not simply, but with the seller in the forest, and we are on target.
"I can shoot, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
