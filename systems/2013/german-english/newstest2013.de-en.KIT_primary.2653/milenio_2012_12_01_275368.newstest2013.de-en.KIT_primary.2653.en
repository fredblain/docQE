"South America has to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of a common state citizenship is a goal, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans, "in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing" and "today is a country."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American state citizenship, the members countries of the Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as it is in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the Agreement of San Jose on human rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we will sign the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said as a reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa asserted that he does not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that it was time to "reasonable suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and procedures."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which requires him to submit it to an interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence on his State territory, while the Swedish law allows this via a video conference on the Ecuadorian Embassy in London could be executed. "
Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental condition of Assange.
"Since it is in our message, I have not spoken to him, the ambassador, however, has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not serious," said the head of Ecuador's state.
There is a danger, though, that he was mindful of physical and mental harm because he was caught in a tight space and carried no physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since the month of June, the granting of an open letter, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe. It underscored that it was in talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, we do not apply in this case, however, there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedures at various European institutions," he said.
And "if Britain morning granted the licence, in my opinion, this is done."
And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogated over Skype, as allowed under Swedish law, and in other cases, the problem is.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity, the bad faith and deceit, the free expression of opinion."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom is not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists seeking profits and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself for Ecuador, no more of those journalists, "and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spit bourgeois countries", and that he had "a re-election will deepen the revolution to continue on the path in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the body must remain "firm and no opportunism and no legal trick-State must take place," because it "destroys the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague before the maritime State sovereignty of Nicaragua, the seerechtlichen borders with Nicaragua to negotiate between the two countries, "absolutely."
Currently, this verdict will not be implemented.
It is a problem between the South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they need to be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be dealt with comprehensively, so that we can overcome them and look to the future.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is true for Latin America, call for international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he, as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third term in succession, he stated that he sees this possibility, "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa promised that if he could lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I am personally has never been interested, but under certain circumstances, such as unfair in Ecuador can be corrected this socio-economic poverty of political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the probable victory guaranteed, so I must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, then I am withdrawing from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"It has been decided," he said.
Correa also took to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had visited for a scheduled, routine treatment, and that would be expected that he could go back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In any case, it means a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
