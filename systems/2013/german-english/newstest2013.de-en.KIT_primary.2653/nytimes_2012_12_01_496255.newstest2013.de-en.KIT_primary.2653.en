There are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law in Colorado.
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime in court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few chunk of marijuana and a pipe he smoked.
Orozco says he and some friends in a car days in Lamar, near the Kansas border, when they were stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Orozco was for possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien subpoenaed - Kavaliers offenses, each with a fine of US $100 - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco.
But it is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller, less drug-related crimes from the law than the location.
Hundreds of regulatory obstacles, which revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures have already dropped.
The police authorities are adults over 21 years for possession of small-scale. This is permitted by law, once the new laws in the next few weeks to come into force.
But state lawyers in more conservative districts Colorados have announced to follow existing marijuana offenses, people are still in court.
At the same time, several cities, the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains, to prevent a new, state-licensed marijuana stores in the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I didn't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which is located east of Denver.
And regulatory authorities in the federal state of Washington, scratch their heads at a loss.
They are waiting for an orientation aid to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is of the opinion that, in any case, most states of Colorado is the regulation of marijuana was legalized the drug only for medical purposes and for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, the state is so good for orientation," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and the end of a grey area in which the state license system does not yet exist, but it is legalized the possession.
And the unpleasant practice issues that need to be addressed at this time, for example, as the government target of a "reasonable access" to license marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres at schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
" No, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the agglomeration of Seattle, " says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis ", a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his employees in an e-mail, he said, the state attorney would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years, and that the police would "immediately" no prosecutions for such offences.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to urban standards to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue.
In Weld County in northern Colorado represents District State attorney Ken Buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently must answer 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, though many have been charged for other offenses.
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations, which point to the time of the offence to crime," saying in a statement.
The reactions are in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults no longer for the possession of small amounts of it.
State district attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but not all outstanding possession proceedings.
"I don't think I wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
While 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and justice system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the country promoted a profound dilemma among local officials, the big green experiment.
In state district attorneys a cultural barrier, " said Sean McAllister, a law attorney in Denver, the defendants standing trial for marijuana crimes and acts locally as spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent a large part of their lives to prosecute people that they can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as a national pattern of cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sales, they also are waiting nervously on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
Advocates of legalization movement hope will give the Ministry of Justice.
Despite several great deal of attention when arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government, the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that investigators probably will not close any doors to confiscate small quantities of drugs, but it will probably be reluctant to condone under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops.
Wait several cities in Colorado, not the federal authorities.
Even before the polling day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although this could open in a year.
Last week decided to Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position in which we license and then somebody at the federal level is a big issue," Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this law change.
We have done this for the community, not for what was decided by the state.
There are still many questions unanswered.
