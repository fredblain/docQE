Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his inauguration, Will Grant analysed by the BBC, the challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is a congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel, seal of several important transport routes in the capital and on the streets of chaos.
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will tie the president and the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon's Mexico can prove economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60000 lives over the past six years.
"My government is fully committed to reducing the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office of the U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy to achieve this goal.
Before he went to the US president on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo remembered example of him.
Residents of the holiday village him write the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on the highways, the Pena Nieto built and a major improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads here.
Plaques associated with his name outside of a modern sports centre and an impression full interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting change," his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a Congressman for the party, Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, as regards the security and the economy, we hope to have an interesting and real change in our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI has been replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he declined.
He is a very direct guy, very committed and have great plans for the country.
He is an excellent State man, above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo, could not be greater.
The town lies hidden under motorway transfers and is in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems are in the village of critical urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military has been switched to the drug gangs operating in the districts and to combat violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a patch of fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill were left alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women in the last two years.
During the term of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico, more than 1000 women - a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killings of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is the problem of the murders of women during his term of office, at least not adequately addressed.
But in the worst case, his government had closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete, typical of the decrepit quarters, Irinea Buendia with tears, as she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life partner.
"When I arrived at her, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten and corpses had already begun.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana us. It is next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, the family has refused until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schw√§tzerin, Unruhestifterin, whiner.
They want us to accept their verdict simply and the mouth.
"But it is not possible when there were so many flaws and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the president bandage, he takes a big responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families were promised in the past six years of violence, and the new president, particularly during his time in office to take care of this problem.
"I hope that as president he is when he was governor," said PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But fear of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza.
