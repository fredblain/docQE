A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily divided the unlimited power of attorney granted more than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket.
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly to approve its final version, the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of the State House was granted two extra months to the end of his work.
Egypt is based now for almost two years on a temporary, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and lead to a legal mess.
This new initiative has a greater division of the country.
For his opponents to the President in his " autocratic delirium, " he breaks his word " and " the right underfoot. "
On the side of his supporters, you can rest assured that it is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, the brothers forced to abandon their plan to explain to the Egyptians, the text of paragraph for paragraph.
For the president, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protests raging across the country.
According to affirm, in an interview with US Weekly Abroad Time Mohamed Morsi appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote.
Given that the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution is supposed to end.
85 mostly Islamist members of the constitutional assembly yesterday, the text adopted in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned away, as they believe that they have not been able to put their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
To achieve the quorum yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy Members added.
Some of the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... the time has come for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the clock of the constitutional assembly was not exactly.
The text adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, all that remains is identical to that of the constitution of 1971, and says that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement had hoped to replace the "principles" by the "rules", which would have a stronger application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed, proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," say the liberals, who see it as propaganda.
For them, according to the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items.
They are particularly Article 220 in the eye of the Al-Azhar University, an advisory role, particularly in relation to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because " the people who will be asked to comment on it, have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals will also be fuelled by the fact that the next chancellor of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
" There is currently no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no Ulema, but academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, " appeased Alexis Blouet writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that " in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity, because the terms of the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqh," [Islamic jurisprudence terminal Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of civilian judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday strongly criticized the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will not be submitted to the parliament, but a national NDC.
There will also be a ban on civil cases in military courts, as requested by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their fears in the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression, freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Furthermore, no article refers to the protection of women, underscores Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
They think the only positive thing is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While Egyptian President last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the Head of State Saturday.
