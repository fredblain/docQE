NKÚ chief: control of the Black system failed due to a fault of politics
The Czech Republic has good bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but in its application.
In the interview for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the Highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied right - and I think that this is not the case," said Kala, the current situation.
A similar outcome seems a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As an example of bad practice, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "black" system.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls, the system is prohibited or allowed?
"A law has to be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, it is not just the government, and chairman of the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the two countries ' laws on public contracts were compared with each other.
What did it mean?
It is a parallel examination, we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature determines how to handle public contracts to build national legislations. And finally, there is the practical application.
All of this, we have compared with each other, and while the review is not yet complete, we could see extremely interesting differences, generally speaking, the laws are perhaps a little " rigorous and perfect, but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more detailed rules. We must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can it help? What is for you from this project?
We are such a joint control could help stop a perfecting of laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds, if that is obviously not very good.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and illegal enrichment and criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be so that the system is only in this way with the "paperwork" and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
The authorities, as is the German equivalent of the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us, and also has a college is just a little different. In principle, the two authorities, however, are similar.
The skills are similar to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, which means that there is this billing courtyards in the individual federal countries - the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can only control of federal funds, which corresponds to our state.
Public funds are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the country's courts billing.
As regards the German legislation is easier than ours?
Generally, I would be without specific details are reluctant to compare. Nichtsdestoweniger Germany is often referred to as a model in some ways, but you cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
Perhaps that is because the auditors are better?
This, but as I said: I don't particularly like to such comparisons.
It should be noted that those countries that have a role model, also with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, right?
As regards the Czech legislation, the importance of your administration, the revision of the law granting you feel any impact?
Given that this novel is only a short time in power, it has so far our tests have not yet.
Because after our controls are in place, we should expect some delays.
We feel effects in the preparatory phase of future inspections, we have introduced the new control instrument "recognition of the risks of inefficiency," and with this nearly 14000 public contracts examined and analysed the impact of changes, of course, because the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of alerts were modified
You see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption.
It is the problem, however, that the rules are "harder" and cannot be met.
Under the previous rules are put to the test persons to the medium (example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the regional council) accountable for any non-compliance with the procurement law is a violation of the budgetary discipline.
However, it is worthwhile to make the law more stringent?
I do not think that way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack the system and abuse, and not to punish those who have committed a form of error does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the solution?
We say, first of all, what is not.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs do not bother with the controls of the so-called "black" - what does that mean exactly?
The system is prohibited or allowed?
A law has to be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, it is not just the government, and chairman of the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work.
He can say: "we change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we are acting as if nothing would.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain events - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, but it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid simply because of defects is excluded.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied right - and that is what is missing, in my opinion.
