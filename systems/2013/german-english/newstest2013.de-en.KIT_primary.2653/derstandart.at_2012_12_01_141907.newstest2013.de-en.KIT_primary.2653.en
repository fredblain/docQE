The MVRDV architects to prove that the true adventures are not only in the head, the example of Spijkenisse, and the mountain of books recently built - 2 photos
"I think the building fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there is to see something interesting," said Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians at a nearby wholesale company, says: "it is nice to the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is still today voluntarily in one of those old-style libraries?
Spijkenisse, a little sightseeing sleep deprived town just outside of Rotterdam, outlandish world record holder.
The 80000-resident community on the lowest Bildungsrate throughout the Netherlands.
To counteract this silly circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to the general education and seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro seem pretty brush Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the offensive was education.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way, the statistics: a library.
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of great daring bar graphs and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared on the competition hearing in 2003, with five books under the arm and a big smile on his face.
And while the jury looked intrigued and shrugged his shoulders, stacking the cheeky Maas, the size of its fine jewelry into a pyramid and finished his actionist founded speech with the words: "love town!"
This is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million is expensive.
It is part of a revitalization project, belong to the underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.
At the beginning of November, the books mountain was awarded the second prize of "best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
It is the small town of facial retort, which until now had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, the white facades, one could be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all has Spijkenisse's first public culture in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: books paradise under glass case.
There is a lift, through the hills, but the real area of reading pleasure at the nearby climbing the topography.
The all-around glazed interior is bright and clear, burned Klinkerboden and elegant street lamps, unambiguously speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
We are already looking for park bench, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and is located in the middle of a large, dark space, which is both uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on its head and reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the books Bergs is sent in the middle of offices, Internet library, chess club, Environment Centre and Haustechnikzentrale.
A particular pleasure is the black bookshelves, wall panels, parapet, stairways are railing.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard shake architects and civil engineers the unknown building offs.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen farm one day came across a waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a milli-meter thin plastic fleece as the root surface.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, then it is ready for the bulky.
The library was pressed the fleece - for the first time in these quantities to four centimetres thick plates.
Discolored under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material, which was a little for new cars and a little reeks of sports shoes.
We arrived at the summit after 105 stages.
At the end of the nearly 500-metre-long tour, you will be rewarded in the Literary Cafe, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in literature Mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," said Trouborst.
Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the books mountain under a glass of fall, the sun shines briefly on sunny days, the interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder standing across the glass facade, shading and captured a large part of the Sonneneinstrahlung.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Do the rest fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics ventured out of the IT industry, the path to the new library.
Also, Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even Spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: the opening a few weeks ago, everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal collection.
This is to be filled for the optical gaps in the not-yet-fully-stocked library - currently 70000 pieces.
The concept is.
The shelves are filled up above.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
" I think our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
If only.
This makes MVRDV who succeeded King discipline called in the jargon of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
As young and uneducated.
This is a starting point for identity.
