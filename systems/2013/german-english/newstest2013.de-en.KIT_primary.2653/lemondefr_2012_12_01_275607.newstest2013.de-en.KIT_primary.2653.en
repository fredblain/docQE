How to clean.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau turn notes that "several hundred officials have stolen millions of dollars," but above all concerned about the role of the "mandate, who are on the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quipped: "I was told that this is a poor substitute of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, according to him, nothing would change the situation, "as long as the election campaign spending will not be strictly limited, black money is circulating in the policy."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public contracts and the financing of political parties, "we cannot fall deeper; the things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
