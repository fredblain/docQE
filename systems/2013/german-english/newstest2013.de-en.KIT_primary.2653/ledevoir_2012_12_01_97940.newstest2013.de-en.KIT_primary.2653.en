Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With its Committee on "die with dignity," Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of the end of life.
The debate has resumed in the near future, although a law draft is being prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look more closely at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone at his home in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer he inherited, he had a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years," he said, half-hearted in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, it is not possible to be prepared," he says.
The disease does its job: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even to eat.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned, agrees to help with the meal.
Boldly, he even to smile and speak with strangers who are around him give him his medication, and a bathroom.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that it heals my diarrhoea, as this is humiliating," he agrees.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this malady.
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man standing shower," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
In return, the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"It depends on the ability of the person," take a step back, he says.
Because in the eyes of several people who work in the palliative care, major events in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will be swamped by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing".
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die, "and by suffocation."
But the illness, I have my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have no wishes more in life," she says, before she accepts that she wears a mask that helps her breathe.
They are expected in the next few days, despite a recent visit to her son, who is from Italy.
The Victor home Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers, body care and assistance with food absorption.
The palliative care is used if there are no other options.
The death.
In Quebec to 11700 inhabitants of a bed for palliative care.
This is very little when you consider that one day we will all die.
Here, life will be continued in the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying wishes a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control their blood sugar.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Last night Mr X, we have a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son drink beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike," says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
The Victor home Gadbois is different every day.
In addition to an old man of 93, the last family gathering in the courtyard, and is supported by his pillow while hitting his honor, dies, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, tragically, he has tried to do everything in order to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel worries.
53% of patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care to a care to relieve the suffering of patients, though the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
This very serious shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several doctors specializing in palliative care, look forward to the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which has been signed by prominent figures of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express its opposition to any such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system is not capable of Quebec's performance enough to ensure that all of the right to have a high-quality palliative care before it is accepted on euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room without has taken measures to alleviate.
I am afraid that the patients are dying simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions hard until the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologists that I will stop the treatment, she replied that they regret giving up the fight, told them.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, to thank the medical staff that it is not granted this request, after the pain of a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that the palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care society of domestic palliative care of Greater Montreal 8% of patients do not speak of a pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often rely on terminale sedation, the patients either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death einzuschläfern.
We can no longer pretend that this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief are increasingly resorting to these terminale sedation.
Patients whose pain is not all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want to put me," but "I want my pain."
The realization of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.
