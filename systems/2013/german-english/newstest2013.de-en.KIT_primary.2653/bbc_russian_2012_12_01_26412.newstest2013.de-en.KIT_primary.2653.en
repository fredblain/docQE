In the past few days across the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to grow, or whether they again soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-profit organizations.
In addition to the increase of modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests following the goal to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanks Giving the so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States, sales of the four million customers, which sometimes led to fray.
On this day, a number of Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million for their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists halted branches of the chain, which targets individuals in low- and middle-income.
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in Walmart stores is, on average, between 8 and 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
The reason that many of the minor Walmart workers paid only on their own work.
The prices and the assortment of goods at Wal-Mart, one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Wal-Mart, the goods are often only sell so cheaply, because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain of severe labor conditions, including lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "black Friday" demanded wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employees, the 9.5 US dollar an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company's average wage increases to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Wal-Mart, 3.2 billion dollars.
That is about 1.1% more than they now pay.
Walmart would fully pay increases to the customers, each purchase only 46 cents more in the future.
This year they would be compared to this additional spending of just 12.39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart satisfied that there were protests in only nine states and the company has no losses.
The Black Friday in his shop from 8 o 'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this period, Wal-Mart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart-Banks on "black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees who work and "the protest is just another PR stunt," the union, which organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests this week in New York, where it does not, however, Walmart stores (which are not in this progressive city, and that is why they exist so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billions of chickens, and yet you granted no sick days, and ye shall not paid for honest work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is 7.25 dollars an hour.
In fast-food restaurants to raise the minimum wage, but not too strong, and, on average, their simple employees in New York, 8.90 US dollars an hour.
Less than they deserve, no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's, stood behind the counter, but the young people were living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw this as the main source of income, or planned to stay there longer.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's, people who complain that they have to live with this wage and sometimes even their children.
On the other hand, there is in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper in a commentary, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children when you didn't know how to eat it.
The participants in the protests that began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks from fast-food restaurants, a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which equates to more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US-American law that prohibits the company leadership to admonish or dismiss the goal to stand in the way and union members.
On the other hand, the company leadership does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
The loud protests, there were also on this day, many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a meeting at noon before the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats said, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's says it should sell billions of chickens, and yet you granted no sick days, and ye shall not paid for honest work."
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should all support the fast-food employees so that they can reach a fair wage and economic prosperity of every New Yorker!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the US-American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, which are far from everyone in the fast-food industry to work in New York, tens of thousands.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of this whole mass protest.
