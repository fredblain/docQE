Guidelines for air jet of balloons, bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey about the oddest of bank charges, this year, has decided to hold the competition "most absurd regulation or idea of the EU's workshop."
"This idea that brought us the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organisation of this survey, the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities example is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are objectively for the insurance companies are less of a risk.
" More incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, " said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations including the mandatory blending of ethanol fuel, which is harmful to nature in its aftermath, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometer, just because this is a relatively small amount of the dangers of substance, or the directive on size of chicken cages for egg this year were much more expensive.
The comment drew criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "Butteraufstrich" or the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 inches long
The EU machine, often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in the rule of one or more member countries in Brussels (Czech Republic is currently trying example, including with veto threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also that bananas from the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 inches long, and not an "anomaly" curvature.
The European Commission defended with the argument that they only to harmonise the different national standards that would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries that the directives would lead to a loss of life.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons in the sale must be equipped with warnings that children under eight years of the balloon puffed up without the supervision of an adult.
The EU, citing an American study, according to the balloons are the leading cause of the drowned children.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious incursions at home
It is quite absurd, a directive that concerns the European officials - everyone in the EU, an official function, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece not to use the name Macedonia and FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities of the EU regulation on the scope of life resources stocks on the territory of a member country.
The EU set the maximum volume of life resources stocks, on the day of our accession to the EU on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the specified volume of canned mushroom, for which threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive the money that they do not have the sea, or from the idea of funding for applications for funding.
These ideas came not from Brussels but from Prague.
" We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will be asking for a refund in the EU, " said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the crowded government camps as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic have another way to sea ports, should pay the Palas hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic was so well that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants to communities, the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically if it means for the establishment of conveying money requests to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations will easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, hence, effectiveness and the development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, more recognition in the member countries.
In the opinion of a deeper problem, experts are more EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, together, but they have been forced by individual member countries in the budget negotiations.
Emotions in this country calls the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and not always wins this battle.
The Czech Republic could defend the designation " Olomoucké tvarůžky ' after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers to rename in " Tuzemák. "
The name of rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU, in the company of the world-famous cheese, feta and gorgonzola places of Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham now Charles Bader biscuits, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Žatec hops hops.
With an EU-brand can boast of Pardubice gingerbread or Hořicer roles.
