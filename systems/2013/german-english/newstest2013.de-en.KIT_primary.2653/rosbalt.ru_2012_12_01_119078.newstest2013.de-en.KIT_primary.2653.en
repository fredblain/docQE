Our own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt, the project, "Peters Burger avant-garde", which is dedicated to city dwellers, who are the avant-garde art and culture.
On the list of already high-ranking representatives of the Peters burger scene that go beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe without having to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-clad BÃ¤rtigen, the Russian Museum, in the summer garden, scene-meeting or exhibitions.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Peters Burger social philosophical artists to create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of Peters Burger avant-garde end of the 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and puts a smile to the faces of his presence on the street with his fellow citizens and provides them with good humour.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and was finally ready to Peters Burger Drehorgelspieler because it for this difficult role in terms of its artist existence, its philosophy and its image.
Kirill, why are you always in red, and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red, a fashion designer with the optics and image.
Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society in the world.
In the company of everything, which differs from the norm, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want my provocations with the people.
Each of my last provocation was an invitation to talk.
- When you knew that you have to become a painter?
- In an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Newskij were exhibited in my work.
I realized that I have to go down this path.
Then I went to the time of the old-free, but not officially recognized as a painter at the time, and new and free painters were incomprehensible.
I befriended the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; hence, "Pushkinskaya 10", and then once was.
For me, theater, fashion, music, actually everything, except the literature.
- And all the united in your Art Clinic... - It was important to me to be at the heart of the Peters burger culture, where the best creative artists.
In 1995, occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and then there were up to the renovation of a musical and artistic club for bohemia, the house of Peters Burger Bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz and I remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
Wireless and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and belonged to the now trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, was removed from her "Leningrad".
Costumes mountain moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them costumes mountain and began his career, but he learned the basics.
Even the gallery "d 137" or the "Griboedov" club have their origin in the Art Clinic.
There, our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there were in the press, a survey of the "people of our city."
"I won in the category of" artist of the year, and I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work under the old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
Your work - have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls, and clearly the timeliness and sharpness of the idea.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as a clown."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be socially, but now it hurts and fear.
In a clown blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
Save the world by stipulating that any fully.
Now all the clothes and is based on the outside and not on the inside.
But perhaps we should not a people's hands, but he spit in the face.
The deception will disappear by the panel.
- Before we saw recently in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers. - An urban culture should have a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can be commercial art?
- These days, commercial art must be cautious, respectful and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Previously, the large groups of people: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is hard to please everyone.
I am not a one-hundred-dollar note each.
Now you will have to consider, whom thou shalt.
Now every cult star has about 100 supporters.
- Among the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand!
- Among women abandoned him, the sexually-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, about 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money and everything.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted these pictures, even for a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career.
Today, there are many misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who were living in poverty and died in poverty and refused to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill what Peters Castle is missing?
- Good culture experts.
They say: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real czar was different, because the Tsar might not seem like a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In Peters Castle, we have what could be the experts, but they closed off the road, as it requires senior experts, the former properly evaluate them the way.
Now only one's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say that they do not accept all of the contemporary art and some painters, therefore, have to find other museums.
- What is Peters Castle for you?
- Peters Castle is not the Capital of Culture in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
Art is difficult to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural realm because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many people who are curious to visit the exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants, the city of St. Peters Castle
