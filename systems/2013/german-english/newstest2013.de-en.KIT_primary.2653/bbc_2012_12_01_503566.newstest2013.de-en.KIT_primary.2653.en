Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the secret to the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
They place in the middle of a pile of dirty, humid sportswear.
And leave it there for a week.
So imagine the nasal stunning smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and this persistent smell in the air, just won't go away.
Rakfisk is fermented with salt sprinkled trout, which, depending on how you stink of fish would like - up to a year in water.
When the darkness of the country in Norway and the weather gets colder Norwegians flock to a festival in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very impressive speciality.
"You eat it raw and then washed it with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General," the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Mansche people more than the Rakfisk" aquavit, says Harvard.
The alcoholic beverage can replace the smell.
I eat a few bites.
If it avoids the Rakfisk in near the nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling capabilities and fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In deepest winter, he was taken out after a long fermentation and, no doubt - with the help of alcohol consumed subdued senses.
A generation ago forced thousands of Norwegians in search of work, to leave their country, mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who not so long ago was much richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, you can buy here.
But here is all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs impressive 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the press of the world, and most people do not seem to care.
Here you hate it still, Anders Breivik to those racist right extremists last year shot 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in its peace-loving country.
It is responsible for today's wealth in Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is so good," says Anna, our waitress, the circular trays with seasoned Rakfisk and the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as it prudent people.
Her English is just as most of the people here.
We are not very tinhorn, we may not boasting.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - a large proportion of industry revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years up to the world economic crisis all threw money around, that they had not, Norway closed its wallet.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk eat," she adds with easy laughter.
I am standing in the snow and on another court, I have had enough of Rakfisk.
I am a moose-burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat.
But in the evening, the Stinkefisch on the menu.
The hotel where I stayed, is one of a number of event locations, which can organise a Rakfisk Dinner, where guests for the best - or, perhaps, the sense of smell the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV broadcast a show master dressed with fly by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Our priorities are," Harvard.
Applause and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But it is perhaps the severe haze of the whole fish.
