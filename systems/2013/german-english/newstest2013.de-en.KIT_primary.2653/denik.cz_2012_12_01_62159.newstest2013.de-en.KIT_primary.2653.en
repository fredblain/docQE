Šimon Ornest: our concerts, we want to gain positive energy
What do you think that the world will take place in less than a month?
This is one of those messages, which we are so happy people.
With our band The Tap Tap, but perhaps we are more fun and say that we are the only band in the world can collect enough positive energy to the world or prevent.
In December, you also have a unique project with three concerts in the world.
You can imagine our readers the project?
It is a country-wide fundraising event, which we plan to take two years.
We want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of the forecast for the December 21, at 11: 10 am.
The day before, on 20 December, from 9: 00.00 a.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which ends in a time zone at 12 hours ahead of the Mayan calendar.
By whom this idea?
Originally from me, then, we have developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
We would like to not only collect enough positive energy in order to prevent the prophets of doom, but we also want to consider, together with the public about the state of this world for our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the prophets of doom, via www.e-tap.cz can also support the people.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, the so-called anthem against the world, with the title "doom".
Today is the national anthem on YouTube. It will resound to the charity concerts?
Of course, and, finally, provided that all is fine and the world will not...
The anthem should be sung by all the performers in all three concerts at the same time.
Furthermore, the anthems in a direct circuit broadcast live by Czech Television.
The text of the anthem of Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, that we realize many charity events and concerts....
We are trying to integrate these people in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in cooperating with us and enjoy it.
The purpose of the proceeds from the concerts against the prophets of doom?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, in which we are already six years with the club, T in the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by teachers to help them with various leisure activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the completion of the Jedlička Institute is a private building in which we do with this project.
At every concert, several groups and performers.
What criteria do you have chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, example, Chinaski, support lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
"Big events" are planned for the future?
In May, we are preparing for the first time in the Prague Spring, and for this concert of an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - when we are already in the United States - would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their overseas plans are not very small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users need wheelchairs are carried in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have many instruments suitcase and other luggage mitschleppen...
Nichtsdestotrotz has always worked without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I sometimes partly understood.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Your travel abroad, you have a settlement in the various countries with accessibility, as they deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you seen these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were witnesses in Russia, in the East is still in its infancy.
To Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, alone in the city centre is on the way, it is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair.
It is not obvious that a wheelchair user example, in the elevator vorlässt.
Fortunately, there are clubs try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things on which we are still lagging behind...
However, an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities themselves in public space, go to the museum, toilets etc.
But it is not usual for a larger group of disabled people actively involved in the public arena, with the band The Tap Tap the West a little.
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only after significant athletes from our midst, artists, actors, politicians and law, lawyers, things really begin to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of strong personalities of goodwill.
The Tap Tap is very popular, but if we go back a few years, what has motivated in 1998 to form a band?
Then I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people, who were keen to deal with.
And since I am a musician and saxophone playing, I have founded, together with a colleague, a music-AG.
Oh, and, over time, as our host, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say anything to get out of hand. (laughs).
The band was known, but only in the last few years, I am wrong?
It is true that helped us cooperation with well-known singers; we have also begun to campaign actively for us.
We have realised that and it is not visible to the outside one's own performance in a certain sense, does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also provide good editors, high-tech equipment and the like.
It was your intention to bring it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the outset, I sensed the potential that we can approach things differently.
In the show business often copied today one of the other.
This is logical, because everything new is viewed with caution and take longer to accept.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap.
The first impression that most of the audience is, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
But that sympathy is entirely superfluous because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop if they have the necessary funds.
I always say that if people with disabilities can not only for myself, it is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a strict boss, we hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you can make any compromises on many things, and also has a certain discipline.
I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week, test preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, that enthusiasm quickly extinguished.
It works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of those were from the outset, since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group of people come and go, but you cannot prevent.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.
