Héctor " Hetin " Reyes: " basketball was my life '
The globetrotter of Basketballs, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, who was sporting a basket for more than 60 years and has traveled the world as a whole.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of intellectual history of Basketballs country Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, was Rexes 6 years for part of this sport, be it as a lower-tier players, players of the first National League, an agent and manager in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My whole life I have had many hats in basketball, even more at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, main business leaders of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes not with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career, almost all of them.
Bayamón in heart
The emotional recollections are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros of the mid-1950s as a player in 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or business leader of the club.
" These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967 as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or trainer.
There were many rewarding years, including successive five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy with BSN.
From then, " Cuco " Ortiz, who was a very good manager, " said Reyes.
I know that I am Gene Bartow, who was here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: " I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.
You want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow, recommended that the Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gauss, creep, and was one of our best shooter.
I remember he said that if Mincy a championship for Bayamon, Gauss further.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gauss was granted to him, but even from a distance, because he was already at the top of the Union in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, in the fourth documented what bronze should have been, if not the Canadian referee would have been a repeat of the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
This group was the 1990 World Cup, the best national team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those that won against the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite is the crew of the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and the team of the United States offered a fight as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities, not the best, but we won a gold medal and was a great pleasure, the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won against all forecast the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking account of his career in different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The boy, I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What remains to be done to you?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes.
The guys in Ponce, for example, playing in only their territory and only in the national Play offs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children of many unnecessary trips and games.
At least I can see the result of the required training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you do today?
I like to listen to music, videos, music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
