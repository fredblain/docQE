My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced, because of the lack of opportunities to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport control as disturbing to me.
Signs pointed to two queues, one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("aliens").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of which I should go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life has been called "Mexicans".
An ethnic shortcuts - just as my friends in Boston, "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I opted for the "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens in the home of my grandfather.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to compete in this language on both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native, and my American accent, I will not go ahead.
So I took my American passport and asked me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues that are expected if the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy is one reason that Mexicans today, as likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc after the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even though he had no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with distrust.
Most Americans probably never wasting a single idea that the United States in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under the barrel of a gun, forced to leave them with more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans in centuries, not in minutes, not to overlook the memories of this event.
Therefore, once a U.S. government official even mildest criticism in Mexico - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans, the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of Monte Zuma's pass on the war path.
And yet the greatest challenge in Mexico is in fact in the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point, a person in our family tree, perhaps one of the parents or grandparents - a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person is a profile, dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may have to live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred, sometimes perhaps, but our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look at us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
They think that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If not, our families in Mexico had failed, they would not.
And then we would not now be caught behind the Seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child, immigrated legally in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them.
While the US State is a citizen, it sees itself as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican-Americans, I know the feeling of belonging, neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but there is not one of them.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican command people and parts of the education bourgeoisie to resume ties with the Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, how great is a visit to the country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And, given the unequal income distribution, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid you alone, amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members were just not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.
