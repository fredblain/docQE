The film Argo: if it is the worst, Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating occupied Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the US, which had for decades, the patronage of his regime.
For the US government had no positive way out of this situation, it could not afford to throw the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in a position in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States and the subsequent failure of hostage-freeing the violent attempt made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages phoned home to a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
Argo, the film by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode in the history of the United States a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy six Botschafts employees.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, helped them an extravagant story to cover its true identity - she travelled with Canadian passports, disguised as members of a Filmstabes allegedly visited the country locations for a science-fiction film.
The combination of genres
The plan, developed by the experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
The camouflage was credible, published articles about the film project in professional journals, held press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called "Caper movie", that is the story of a successful feat as example, the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the movie the mood levels, on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations.
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and it is easy to exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA's headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table in the official gallery, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is a remarkable restarting his career with this film.
A spokesmen ridiculed actor has become a respected director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film after the thriller No breeze (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film not in the native Boston by director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the previous films, the director of the Hollywood standard.
Affleck, however, is also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada.
The best scenes of the film to play in the streets and the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the sequence of the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, yet conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that comes when somewhere even history.
A similar effect, Affleck and his team also fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much in too many places
The director had to face the fact that the story is not a lot of exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
With a few works but quite successfully, reality sometimes nachhilft - which is not always so elegantly acts (the scenes of the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or the persecution of hunting on the runway, artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is caused by the need to have too much to act in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, their characters but deserved more space, and that they are in the film by no means alone.
Afflecks movie loses a little traction, it is a movie with some interest, and the design and reminiscent of a thriller from the 1970s retro-style approve.
Enthusiasm, it is very difficult.
As a reminder of a living piece of history in some way, and as evidence of how the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is sufficient.
