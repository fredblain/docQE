With Bitcoin payments and selling is possible without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchanges on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies available, a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as convertible, a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15000 computers in the network have already been collected about 200000 transactions.
Several thousand webpages accept Bitcoin as a donation, or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin had reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later, at 2 dollars before he recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to the world trade of real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October showed interest in virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as a "virtual currency" with the greatest success, "in competition with the dollar or the euro," and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the credits, which are used to make progress in a video game by winning games or buy (and sometimes back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, the trade is controlled by a central authority.
With Bitcoin are all at the same time, the network nodes repositories of the accounting books, auditors, issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each Trans action takes place between two users in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of the action with the Trans-related data electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the Trans Action.
It is also possible to use the contents of the file to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the accounting book in the entire network of public accounts are available.
The crucial step is to enter this new Trans action in this book.
This is a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer, "" the new Trans Action and add a number before the whole thing is "chopped."
The goal is to find the number, which is a special fingerprint (many leading zeroes).
If this number was found in the other nodes can check whether it is the right one.
The Trans Action is permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user for cheating could ever twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money would pay for only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other is a link, because they both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
In Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, but up to one hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre....
Moreover, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The website, the services of Bitcoin, were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The weakness is not the Minutes," assuring Pierre Noizat, who has just Paymium introduced, this is a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering using anonymous service.
But also cash in these shortcomings.

They will be accepted by others, such as the blogging platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the book analyzes accounting and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are in circulation.
In November, was a "mega-final sale."
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coin Abul, Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a Trans Action Network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions are cheaper.
In addition, the owner's identity and can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at dealerships, and the latter must install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply have to provide an address by telephone "and" can be detected, Pierre Noizat, assured that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in the hierarchical systems for more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report to re-evaluate the various risks today as a highly respected in the event of a success of this currency.
