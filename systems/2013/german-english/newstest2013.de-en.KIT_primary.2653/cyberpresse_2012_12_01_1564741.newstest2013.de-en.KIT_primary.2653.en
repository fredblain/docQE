Prostate cancer early identification: the test should be done or not?
The PSA-wise, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to a greater reluctance of men already undecided for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be done or not?
We have sought the opinion of two doctors.
The studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of age, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30-40% higher when no screening was carried out.
I therefore recommend that the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when one has a direct relatives, which was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men, Afro-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer was identified.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others, the indolent.
The patient really needs to be made to understand the extent of the risk of their cancer, giving him the possible options, which if left untreated prostate cancer types, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, which has cancer detected no treatment because their cancer is aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposing an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
Certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who is not.
I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests.
The most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy life, the best way to reduce the risk of him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and get enough.
"If there would be no more smoking, would increase the value of at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several types of cancer.
It harms the health of the people.
"Today there are still regrets in Quebec, 1.5 million smokers," the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society also overweight and obesity, the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, colon, rectal examination, feeding tubes, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life against colon cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In them, it increases the risk of a Grimm or fattening colorectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin additives and cancer.
Their studies are not conclusive.
The Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
While the study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer showed another increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is to talk about his concerns and his family Vorbelastung with his doctor.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
