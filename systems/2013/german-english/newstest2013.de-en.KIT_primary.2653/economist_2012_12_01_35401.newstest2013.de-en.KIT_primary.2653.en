Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected cornerstone for peace
There will never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to have a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations were killed, countless buildings to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis - and, for the first time rockets from Gaza are in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to suspect that the deadly standoff could finally end.
A war neither lost nor won
At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation were inappropriate.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November the this week's battles have strengthened the Hartgesottenen on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although his group even large losses.
Although a number of Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in a bleak and packed densely populated corners of the planet, it is not managed until now, Hamas to destroy Israel.
Indeed, Hamas wins in the Westjordanland, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders might come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a revival of regional power, once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken the Hamas party - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power over Syria, where rebels have an increasingly Islamist-style, before Bashar Assad falls could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And, in particular, the rise of President Muhammad Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the most by far the inhabitants, and most important Arab country on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled the secular despot of Egypt until his fall 2011 for 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschw√§gert and their leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove as a player, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer dangerous.
The Israeli missile defense system, the "iron Dome", and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep.
In diplomatic terms, unwavering, the United States and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.
Although the rockets from the Gaza Strip killed 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least because of the security wall has gone into the Westjordanland and thus in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. This to protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared for international law, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu. His Likud Party in the run-up to the elections on January 22, Avigdor Lieberman affiliated with a militant group.
Why this nanny cunning Palestinians and left to their own state?
If they really had control of the Westjordanland, they would not like their colleagues in Gaza also fire missiles?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish you should dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners. But the Arab spring could make them.
Even if the Islamists in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the problems in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower is hardly new Arab governments to help repair its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi, working with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a cease-fire, could be a sign of promise - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt will explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is undermining the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly over the years, its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The answer is that the more sensible people on both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and is represented by this newspaper: two states, Israel's security purposes areas.
The small, for the near future, hope that the cease-fire outside grants more power to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar to stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by area of exchange and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsiders, Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama also needs to do its bit to push Israel to negotiate.
He failed the vision of his own peace plan during his first term.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also unwilling to participate in it.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
