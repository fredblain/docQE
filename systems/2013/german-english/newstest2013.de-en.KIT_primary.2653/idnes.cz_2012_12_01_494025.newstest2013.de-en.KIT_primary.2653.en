Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the 20th member of the Space Agency, Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (according to the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008, ESA member).
Poland began in 1994, close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and took part in the following years several ESA projects.
Poland's path to space began much earlier, however.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos with space travel, not always met with understanding.
I remember the example of the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, the observatory at the idea of the author from his pioneering work "entrance to the Outer Space Exploration".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905), the audience, however, and after years remembered Šternfeld that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for entrance to the Outer Space Exploration " donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix REP-Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote several books on the scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space was honored by the fact that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925, was built in Poland, a rail trolley for a rocket.
The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket will be used to start or the brakes of the trolley.
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research work, the institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents that the research was up to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, appeared in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, the "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects related to the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology, coordinated by the person who was passing the scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of his work was the start of the war.
Published another article on space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrt (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of the company in 1954 in the November edition of the journal Problemy, in the space of four long articles.
The article by Prof.M. Subotowicz proposes establishing a Raumfahrt society.
At that time, there would be the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space.
In its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrt society PTA to accede to the International Federation for space travel was founded in 1951, and indeed the PTA was due in the autumn of 1956.
The following year became the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space flight.
He was president until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA instrumental in the development of highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM 1, was completed in 1957, the first starting on October 10, 1958.
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959 and began in the desert Blęd flight tests with the two-phased missile RM 2.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should be able to provide real scientific work, the rocket RM 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km, and for the observation of altitude winds.
However, in 1962, was set to further development.
Successor to the first missiles RM the meteor was developed in the years 1962-1965-1 rocket.
The rocket was designed as a two-phased missile, its overall length was 510 cm and weight was 32.5 kg.
This rocket have developed three types (Meteor-1A, 1B and 1c states), which are distinguished from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 litres capacity, meteor-1B 0.34 liters and Meteor-1c states about 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude of all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, was developed in the aviation institute the meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg, at an altitude of about 60 km.
The versions of meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Also worth noting is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, two years later, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek was second astronaut.
