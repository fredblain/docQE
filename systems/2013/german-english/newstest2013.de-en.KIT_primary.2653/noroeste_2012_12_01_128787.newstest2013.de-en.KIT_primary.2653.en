After the nomination court in the United States has confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the group of Vitro, which was a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a sinister precedent will be created for each national company with offices in the neighbouring country of payment problems.
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the company's Mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes in contradiction to international agreements are not valid.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment handed down on June 15, the judge Harlin Hale on the court in Bancarrotas for the Northern District of Texas, the Mexican company the confiscation of their property, helpless in the face of the other side of the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, the door to call for three inconsistencies of the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judges of the matter, indicating that the creditors are subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, says the nomination of the Fifth Circuit Court in New Orleans, first, that the main proceedings for the trade in Mexico is bankrupt.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in the procedures for payment incapacity of companies with countries outside the profile is not known.
In fact, was created for that purpose, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, the American Law Institute, was used as a mediator.
Secondly, the ruling states that without the votes of the companies after the recognition of liabilities in the bankruptcy of mass, the branches of Vitro, with its parent company, not the majority needed for the restructuring of the debt.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case was admitted to the scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by a company of the group from the Instituto Federal de National Mercantiles (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies).
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the voices of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained the courts of the United States is in vitro, i.e. the vulture funds such as Capital, Aurelio Aurelio Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would have a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the court nomination.
On the other hand, there is Vitro debt for its difficult situation in 2008 in the context of the economic crisis in the United States, the blows to the country.
For this reason, puts the Gonzalez Sada family conflict before the same court nomination, so that the vote in plenary session, by all the judges, because only three of them.
Is not the Cerciorare-appeal calling for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious in this case is that the court had a document that was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura an amicus curiae (friend of the court), where the described by vitro procedure within the framework of the law on trade, bankruptcies, and noted that it is strictly to the agreement signed by both countries to meet the Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
It will also pointed out that the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade has been subject to the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border payment inability to guarantee the equal treatment of debtors and creditors.
