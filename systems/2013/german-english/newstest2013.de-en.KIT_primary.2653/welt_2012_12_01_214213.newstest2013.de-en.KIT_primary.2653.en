Daily drink butter - 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country in the 97-year-old young comparison.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.

A search in the country in the 97-year-old young comparison.
The trip by the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The mini-bus rumbling through the winding road, past densely wooded hills and rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan's border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
The Caucasian population group of Talyschen, not much is known, except that it is perfect Farsi and Azeri and very durable.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small town of flaunts to impressively terrible architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists from Europe come here is too onerous, the directions from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
The 323 miles you need eight hours because the street is not high enough.
The fabulous wealth of the country's oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the potential to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, the only one in the world.
The Vita is documented in the area of about eight dozen Talyschen older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years fathered a child
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, 168 years old.
A birth certificate, but there is not.
And given the oldest documented person was 122 years old, seems to Müslümovs age very doubtful.
"In 1805, he was born in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he fathered a daughter.
Has Şirali Müslümov at his age for a couple of decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard from the very elderly in Central Asia.
"A striking number of hochaltrige people is also available in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "live in Sardinia, huge numbers of very old men."
Due to a lack of documentation, however, there was no scientific proof of age, because in my opinion.
Every day, cup melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often, a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why live here in the south so many high elderly?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the particular genes of Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is in the eating.
But the calorie-rich diet of Talyschen should be healthy meat, bread and milk products, in particular, love, and many of those daily drink a glass of melted butter, appears from a scientific point of view of food is not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people in Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years for this popular young comparison.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the floor with a butter barrel they tirelessly and creates.
Eight people live under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents.
Also, two small children.
In the kitchen, the guests tea is served in the characteristic, belly-shaped Armadu-glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect and link, hidden under her headscarf, long, dark blonde braids, her son proudly unveiled in front of us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, they never went out and retained their color.
I have never used, "" shampoo, says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
It has only ever eaten what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket life.
She tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the " beloved father Heydar Aliyew took power.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which the Father of the Nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power, his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva per month as a pension, an amount which can live for local conditions.
And, perhaps, has Mirzayevas long gray son: "the elderly in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved and cared for, are happy.
If that is no reason for as long as possible to stay alive
