"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
There are great players.
Every day I am on their side of progress.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements gives me every day to improve my game.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I break in enthusiasm.
I have always been gradual progress since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my game time at Saint-Etienne.
Thus, the competition from Carlo Ancelotti introduced advantage...
The new additions this summer are used to a very high level.
They also know that each training unit.
This means that a player like me to stand up and do the best.
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my game.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect all technicians.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no other person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
The trust he has placed in me, as well as an explanation for my services.
What do you think of the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the frontrunner.
But lurking in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League, we have qualified for the final.
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have a very good European teams our input.
First of all, we want to be first in our group of Porto, so that we can fight for the return leg of the Achtelfinales as a home game.
The PSG in the short term a major European club?
He has already had its budget...
In order to become a major European club must win the Paris title and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG resources so that this project taking shape.
It would be a major failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really important to us, the cream of this title.
We were close last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be champion with 79 points....
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media too much from the PSG?
In the light of what has been invested, and the players we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
We accept that.
However, if we are in a home match against Troyes win 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us, that is definitely a little frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We never could win every weekend with a 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to establish a game plan.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, fails to qualify for the final, and also has huge expenditures.
In relation to the sums invested was believed to break with 15 points ahead!
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season of the new PSG "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling victors and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties.
The PSG appears to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better that people speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic performance is strong and many goals.
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This inspires others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, allowing everyone to make progress.
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was keen to take part in this.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me some playing time.
I saw things I am stronger.
Today, I will be able to achieve good games in the national team.
This was my baptism with the ' Bleus ' my hope.
What has happened in Ukraine, we learned our lesson and now we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the group qualification for the World Cup.
The national coach is strictly, the players and stimulates the victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not.
Blanc had reached his goal, he had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps ' Bleus ' will lead to Brazil.
The forced draw on 16 October in Spain (1: 1) an opening match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a comparable game in my career.
