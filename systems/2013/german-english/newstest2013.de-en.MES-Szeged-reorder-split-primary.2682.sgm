<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to confront the re-election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policy with the need to combat election fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Brennan Center holds the latter as a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States, as the number of people killed by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The attorneys for the Republicans have seen in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of election fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: these new rules will adversely affect the turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to Canada, the federal states for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this sense, the majority of American governments announced since 2009, new laws that make it difficult for the process for the registration or the ballot.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has won after the elections of November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives were able to be recorded in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011, which restrict the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws that require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, these laws also will be shortened by the time frames for the early vote, declared the law invalid, to register as voters on election day, and denying citizens the right to vote, for which a court acts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections of 2006 has to show no US government demanded by the voters, photo identification.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first state that has made such a request.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the last two years before they helped to draft legislation in 34 states, with which the voters will be forced, photo identification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal identification card as the health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters who do not have their own state authority of a government issued picture identification.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in the 2012 does not have such a card.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, often paying more than a hundred dollars to obtain the necessary papers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions on young people, minorities and low-income people are affected disproportionately.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, with 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This goes further.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, who are seen as voters who cast their ballots for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not permitted to use their of their establishment issued photo identification.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, allow same states choose members of fishing and hunting clubs, the more on the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2004, a federal state asked for proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state created such a demand.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures aim clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states laws promoted, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="33">Furthermore, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, the campaigns have contributed to the registration of voters in the general election in 2004 to register some 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">Because of the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Moreover, the Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed to shorten the period for the early vote.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same applies to the Hispanic population.</seg>
<seg id="40">The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast, the White, which constitute 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate, voted in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters vehemently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">They were able to limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of the 34 states passed laws that require the flagship of a photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim of influencing the results in the decisive state for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to confirm with certainty that this legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain: these new rules will adversely affect the turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prostate cancer screening test: should be made or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The PSA test, in fact, sometimes with false negative results, INACCURATE or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="3">This leads to greater hesitation previously undecided men for the implementation of early detection tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">The test should be made or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have asked for the opinion of two doctors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The studies conducted in the United States were many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time from Europe came to the conclusion that there is a big difference in mortality rates of patients with and without detection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study has shown that the likelihood of metastasized around 30 to 40% is a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years later, when no early detection was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore commend the test from the age of 50 years ago or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, which was already ill with prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">In men, African-American origin is also a higher risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as the cancer was detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are cancers that others who are aggressive and indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient must be the extent of his cancer risk really understood to be made by the possible options, showed him where Prostatakrebse can remain untouched, if it affects the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases, rather than an active surveillance of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men, which we did not detect cancer treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">It proposes an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated, and who is not.</seg>
<seg id="17">I therefore commend the implementation of the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be executed or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the International Society for urology Movember has developed a tool with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of the PSA tests.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Prevention of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress of research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and will be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If there were no smoking more, this value would rise at least 50%," Andr- Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is assumed that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several remain completely unknown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Cancer Society of the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It damages the health of the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," the spokesman Andr- Beaulieu Deplores.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, reduced the risk of dying of cancer by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also support the outbreak of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They seem to increase the risk for breast, Grimmdarm, pancreatic, oesophageal Mastdarm, and cervical cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In large quantities, it increases the risk of contracting a Grimm or broiler colon cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">Sausages should be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of meat, smoked, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, several scientists examined the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Their investigations are currently do not conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the Canadian Cancer Society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">During a study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D also revealed the cancer was not yet clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Moreover, Mr Beaulieu stressed how important it is to talk with their doctor about his concerns and his family England.</seg>
<seg id="51">"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Analyzing the Higgs boson</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosons last summer, has caused a stir, and for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is believed that this only is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is for the mass of all the objects in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And, finally, is the last particle whose existence was of the standard model - our best, or at the very least "false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but observed empirically or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physicist, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particles, and that it is predicted by the Standard Model Higgs boson.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week on a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data in order to be completely safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, we believe that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we look at what is at stake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In a world where there is inevitably a crucial law, which means that two objects cannot be at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not possible to violate this rule - and you try not to because they will hurt themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law for you: 'the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "elementary," while the "state" is, by and large, from some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assuming the physicist, a part of the particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione Ina and obey the principle.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in another move the bosons, a gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, certainly not this principle, which means that they are in fact at the same time in the same place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosons itself, according to the Web site The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is) absolutely amazing into two groups: the decay that we will not treat here and the "power" through which the great forces of nature and spread the Higgs boson, which would be used in any way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It must be emphasised, however, that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, such as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a bosons of exceptional banality: the Photon or "light particles," which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when a speeding Particules with an electric charge or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field at precisely this place "disturbed," like a pebble, who was thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">This "disturbing" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "of power."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable Militara</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same is true for the Higgs boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs field, should "be disturbed" that this only shows.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energy, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could be zerfurcht only by a very large rocks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, a giant particle accelerator as CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, would never be a sheet of paper on the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">And not all particles interacting with the Higgs field: those that do have a degree, while the other (such as the photon) have no mass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For what can all this research is now "well," said Mrs Plamondon asks?</seg>
<seg id="29">For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they will enable physicists to investigate all the differences between the observations and predictions of SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are, in fact, a number of physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some holes of the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">It must be said that the latter still has some serious shortcomings, because it offers no explanation for the gravity (UPS!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe, UPS (again!).</seg>
<seg id="32">However, at CERN such exemptions were not found until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.</seg>
<seg id="35">By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories not suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution.</seg>
<seg id="36">You saw scientific applications, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, developed in 1962, and even the first time line were the first laser gepulst) - has already said that the laser was seen at the beginning rather than a "laboratory gimmick."</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to applications from all the instruments that surrounded the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, in turn, Willard Boyle Rihák has developed during his work at a small room.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it was not the original purpose, serves this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" in 2009 and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that we can never really know...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care - the best way to die... | le devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">With your Committee for "death with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of the living.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must be included in the near future, although a bill is being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, in this important area, much remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le devoir has tried to look at this closer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate cancer, the aufzehrte him, he had a period of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They gave me to live five years, I made seven years," he said, half-hearted in his bed at the home of Victor-Gadbois beloeil in palliative care, in which he had arrived the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"However, it is always a shock, and you can't be prepared," he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease does its job: an immense weakness prevents him from to go to the bathroom alone and even to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the table before a delicious lunch, agrees to help he resigned, to get the food.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brave it manages to smile and even to talk with the stranger, which employs around him, bring him his medication, and give him a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My biggest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, since this is humiliating," he says.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team found a cure for this malady.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man pinkelt in the face," Pierre had 10 shutouts, a psychologist at the Home, Victor-Gadbois told.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the early stage of an unacceptable humiliation is to return for some people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"That depends on the ability of the person," to take a step backwards, he notes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, in the midst of this major setbacks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients who are placed in the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, you will be inundated by the doctors and nurses who care for them, not with the so-called "healing" care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is aware of, "and" to die of suffocation.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the disease, I have learned my children really know.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good kids," she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have no more hope in life," she says, before she accepted that it puts on a mask, which helps her breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">They expected in the next few days still have a last visit their son, who is from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the home Victor-Gadbois offering with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the food intake.</seg>
<seg id="29">The palliative care will be used if there are no other options.</seg>
<seg id="30">To make the dying.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec a bed for the palliative care comes to 11,700 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is very little, if you take into account the fact that we all die one day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here, life will continue under the best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Given the dying according to request an oral care with brandy or Pepsi.</seg>
<seg id="36">The diabetics need to control their blood sugar levels.</seg>
<seg id="37">And the death is part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening, we have a beer served Mr X, who died in the course of the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help families and patients alike," nursing director Nathalie Savard reported.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the home Victor-Gadbois is not like the other day.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition to an old man from 93 years, enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and well supported by his pillow, while one is in his honor, dies, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children, tragically, after he tried to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For six months, three to five beds are filled with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years ago," said Dr. Christiane Martel tells worried.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to relieve the suffering of patients when they reached the final stage of their lives, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">These very serious shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.</seg>
<seg id="49">For the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">Dr. Christiane Martel, according to the health system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting a move to euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, without being able to take measures to alleviate their.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients are dying simply because they have not received adequate health care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time, several ONCOLOGIST their patients despite the worst predictions stubbornly to the last day.</seg>
<seg id="54">The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as they canceled an arduous chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my Onkologin, that I will drop out of treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, they said.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, she had told me that I was at the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No omnipotent care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have requested to die, the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish to thank after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it must be said clearly that palliative care is not when the pain treatment.</seg>
<seg id="60">After Elsie Monereau palliative care, head of the society of domestic palliative care of Montreal talk about 8% of patients to a pain treatment.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the end of life, the doctors so often-terminal sedation, which amounts to the patients either einzuschläfern sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We can no longer pretend that we take this side of suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Patients without pain relief will increasingly have to rely on these-terminal sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients whose pain is relieved not to say all the same sentence: "I want to die."</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not necessarily mean, "I want them to put me," but "I want my pain is relieved."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This season they have adopted with PSG a new dimension.</seg>
<seg id="3">How would you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">You can say it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">Great players have come.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day I make progress on its side.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff gave me too much.</seg>
<seg id="8">These elements spur me on a daily basis to improve my game.</seg>
<seg id="9">And in a game that is even easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything goes very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I break in enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my start in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">You are thus introduced by Carlo Jeff competitive advantage...</seg>
<seg id="14">The newcomers this summer are accustomed to playing very high levels.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that every training session is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">This means that a player like me who must face and his best wishes to be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Incidentally, Jeff Carlo gives me a lot in terms of my game position.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Jeff is the right person for the job?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Jeff inspires all technicians respect.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ligue 1, there is currently no Compareable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He draws on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He had contact with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that he will win another title in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">This time I had just recovered from an injury.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of Lyon, while only finishers are awarded sprint points.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we lurk in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main objectives is the Champions League is: we have qualified for us in this way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the aim of the association in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to go as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, we are going to play against a very good European teams have our say.</seg>
<seg id="37">First of all, we want to be first in our group, Porto, so that we can carry out the return leg of the Achtelfinales as home game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The PSG can be in the short term, a major European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">He already has the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to be a great European club, Paris has to win the title and make a name for themselves in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is not the case today.</seg>
<seg id="42">PSG is the financial resources to make this project takes concrete forms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">It would be a big failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, this would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year it is really at the heart of this volume.</seg>
<seg id="46">Last season we were close.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough in order to secure the victory.</seg>
<seg id="48">We have finished the season with a strong performance.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have finished with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally, you should be with 79 points...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">I believe that this is the right thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">In view of what has been spent and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accept that.</seg>
<seg id="57">But if we can win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and we still have a little place, which they accuse us, it is a little frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what the people expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We could never win every weekend with 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to draw up a game plan.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team builds up over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League, we have proven strength.</seg>
<seg id="64">You look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, failed to qualify for the first knockout round, and has also made huge expenditure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In relation to the sums invested believed you to the game with 15 points ahead.</seg>
<seg id="66">This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup would ignore.</seg>
<seg id="67">, Lyon and Marseille, who were in the last season was not good geboostet of this new PSG. "</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that we won it, despite all the difficulties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">The better that people speak of a "Zlatan dependence."</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">That is why he has come and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Everywhere he has played, he has to see that he is a great player and a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the team we respect both the player and the person.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respected the people who surrounded him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This encourages others to improve their game.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, who is one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone else to make progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">It was for me to take part in the heart of this European Championship.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, to slap me my injury prevented some game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw things that I am emerged stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, I will be able to achieve good games in the national team.</seg>
<seg id="86">Since this was my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.</seg>
<seg id="87">From what occurred in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson and now we need to put an exemplary behaviour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He has achieved promising results.</seg>
<seg id="90">We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">The national team coach is strictly, is close to the players and the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">As Laurent Blanc was it.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would like to make a comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had achieved his goal when he qualified for the European Championships.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" after Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">The 16 October forced a draw in Spain (1: 1) an opening match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game has given us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified and transaction processing fees between the parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, as so often in these technologies to reach a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies designed to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, this is of Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (dollar, euro convertible, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange as BitTorent, which provides for the direct exchange of files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With 15,000 computers in the network about 200,000 transactions were already covered.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several thousand Web pages Bitcoin accept a donation or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had five months later, he fell to 2 dollars today, before it recovered to around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the Web site bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to the world trade by Realen currencies or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) shows in an October report on virtual currencies interest.</seg>
<seg id="10">She describes as "the virtual Bitcoin currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a video game, you win the game or buy (and sometimes to share).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the trade is controlled by a central authority each time.</seg>
<seg id="14">With Bitcoin network nodes are all at the same time, the invoice book, securities firms, money issuers and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the difference that the user choose a different address for each payment, which the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A number of this transaction-related data will be signed electronically through a double encryption system.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins are traded in the entire network of widespread accounting book of public accounts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is happening on a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, is a sort of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a fragment of the file, i.e., the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The use of" the new transaction and add a number, before the whole thing will be hacked. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to find the one number that gives a unique fingerprint (many leading zeroes).</seg>
<seg id="26">If this number has been found, the other nodes can look effortless, whether it is the right thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is thus linked permanently with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user wants to pay to defraud two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without VerknÃ1, because both have different fingerprints.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To prevent inflation this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The circulating in Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, leaving a margin...</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, the difficulty of the task is improving with each performance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network has already had ups and downs.</seg>
<seg id="34">The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stole the Bitcoin deposits.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The common vulnerability does not affect the actual Minutes," Pierre Noizat Paymium, has introduced a company to pay with real money and the network Bitcoin uses assured.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also reported on the activities of money laundering through this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, cash has also these shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="38">Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations.</seg>
<seg id="39">Others, such as the blog platform WordPress they are accepted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyses of the Weizmann Institute in Israel and the invoice book shows that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, a "mega-Schlussverkauf" was launched.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company, the Bitcoins Coinabul converted into gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">, Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on the currency is a firm believer in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.</seg>
<seg id="44">His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses but Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, the holder manages its identity and can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system can be implemented easily with retailers, and the latter must install any new terminals or computer programs.</seg>
<seg id="47">You just have to give an address that can be photographed by a telephone "and recognized," Pierre Noizat indicates that assured that he has thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is a general trend, the hierarchical systems are covered in favor of more horizontally oriented systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It will take some time before Bitcoin prevails in 2013, but could be a turning point," he predicted.</seg>

<seg id="3">French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (kapisa and Surobi).</seg>
<seg id="4">NATO and the United States are likely to follow suit by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is time that the Afghan army to take possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their own future, without expecting anything from us.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have punished by the Afghan farmers in particular, we have seen them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="7">And ourselves with our 88 slain soldiers and injured and crippled.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed international presence, as at the time of the Soviets.</seg>
<seg id="9">They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if you Paysafecard jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sometimes tolerated, supported by local insurgents, the latter will be here any more, if the Western countries are discreet.</seg>
<seg id="11">Funded by the base in Nijrab, I watched by a with almond trees and hills, using the French loans from the withdrawal of French troops, was carried out properly.</seg>
<seg id="12">The truck überflogenen helicopters and armored convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">By the end of 2014, there will be no Einströmen more of the Taliban regime in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since her irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the time, Kabul was empty and the country plunged because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their power was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to safety.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the al-Qaida organisation overpowered farmers, but their situation has improved. "</seg>
<seg id="18">Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.</seg>
<seg id="19">The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have turned in the commercial property confiscated by the government in order to sell land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive American of subcontracting.</seg>
<seg id="21">You have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="22">As I heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not made of thieves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who have managed to make the American contributions: the capital flight is considerable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The young people are tired of the war and its ideology.</seg>
<seg id="25">During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.</seg>
<seg id="26">About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the cities of the public schools are full of girls as young.</seg>
<seg id="28">These young people, who want to return to the obscurantism, neither the parties nor to the corruption of some executives, you will need to provide jobs.</seg>
<seg id="29">All, including the armed factions, are obsessed with mobile phones, the television with his Turkish series, which represent a modern world is seen everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">An army is now available.</seg>
<seg id="31">The authorities, under whose command they will be regarded as legitimate?</seg>
<seg id="32">Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle has already committed to the restoration of the militia in the province, which will be beyond the power of the central government.</seg>
<seg id="33">Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should have some degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations benefit, but through the abolition of the office of the prime minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make him a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">President Karzai wants no foreign controls, especially during the elections planned for April 2014.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, his country has been around since the 1950s and before long dependent on foreign aid.</seg>
<seg id="36">Industries were never rebuilt, functional storage plants are not available and major irrigation system has not been repaired.</seg>
<seg id="37">Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables are produced nothing.</seg>
<seg id="38">The private initiative will be the priority.</seg>
<seg id="39">In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.</seg>
<seg id="41">This reinforced the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, to seize it.</seg>
<seg id="42">Without the energy to handle the iron or copper ore on the spot, or without an export over the mountains no mining is possible.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Chinese have the copper mine of MES aynak already almost deserted, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to turn on the huge Buddhist site their excavations and the main employers remain in the province.</seg>
<seg id="44">One day, it will be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which imports and exports are largely dependent on re-establish normal relations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on November 20.</seg>
<seg id="46">The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young French Institute for colleges, universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sectors, support the archaeological delegation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages held many charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carry out of a small French non-governmental organization, to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.</seg>
<seg id="48">This work, for which many local workers were needed, have helped to suppress the insurrection, wells, irrigation and drinking water, restoration, fruit trees, soil conservation and increase of farmland.</seg>

<seg id="1">A constitution with the sledgehammer in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains divided on the constitutional declaration, the authority granted unrestricted Provisionally, more than ever, he has decided to go for broke.</seg>
<seg id="4">To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly the next day will pass its final version.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week before the head of state had given to this House two additional months for the conclusion of his work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Egypt is now for nearly two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and a legal muddle.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has provided only for an even greater divisions in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," he continued, "by breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the part of his supporters can rest assured that there is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, the brothers forced to abandon its plan to explain the Egyptians the text section for section.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president is to find a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, during the protest rages across the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">After affirmations in an interview with the US weekly Time Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since the Egyptian people with this back on a hasty vote is an ultimatum: "either vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly approved the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of Liberals has fulfilled the request.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned away, because they believe that they have not been able to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or the society acted alike.</seg>
<seg id="19">To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, deputy members, it added.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprising that most of the articles were approved unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">The commentators also found it amusing that the only difference of the day is the time for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the pendulum clock the Constituent Assembly was not exactly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2, attracted all the attention, identical to that of the constitution of 1971 and says that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement had hoped, "the principles" by the rules "to replace what made a stricter application was possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, is the fact that this article was not changed, a demonstration of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy" liberals say that have seen only as propaganda.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is based on other items.</seg>
<seg id="29">They have been especially Article 220 in the eye, which recognises the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly with regard to verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the Egypt specialist Sophie pommier this is worrying, because the people who will be asked to give its opinion, "are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the Liberals are also fed by the fact that the next chancellor of the university may be far less moderate than the present.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At this moment is to identify any specific religious commitment.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, are not ulema, but academics who have been trained on the part of the French system, "Alexis Blouet, who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition appeased.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he concedes that "220 can be available in relation to the article an ambiguity, as are the terms used by the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is here, in particular, the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Red.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future could be raised the question of whether civil judges are competent to decide. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday will severely criticized because of the far-reaching powers he has given the president of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim brothers argue that they are compared with the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but a national defense council.</seg>
<seg id="43">There will also be a ban on civil procedure in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter with also share their fears in the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right of free expression, particularly for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not included in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian President yesterday evening on television saying something, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The proponents of head of state are on the march Saturday.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While lawmakers and human rights activists to discuss what the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminal act with fake certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the home remaining families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On December 1, a law came into force, according to which everyone working immigrant must pass a test that certified knowledge of the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this rule applies only to immigrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the tests of time, according to federal immigration authority should be for all future guest workers on duty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not just language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Language skills must be demonstrated both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">The bill would also exempt people who receive their education certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Meaning, and the protection of the rights issue</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The entirety of the review will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of Friendship, the Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">The migrants may take the tests in all cities; now in Russia were already more than 160 appropriate center opened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal immigration agency.</seg>
<seg id="17">Human rights activists, however, said before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: what makes the whole thing?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes to the legislation, which must have language skills, both for the Russians as well as for guest workers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all, spokesman for the immigration agency, say it is trying to reduce the number of forced laborers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," the head of the representation of the federal immigration agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew says.</seg>
<seg id="21">Their rights must be protected, but before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Migrants on problems without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Sebelew is convinced that a future immigrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which will put him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he endure with dozens of his peers months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Us many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In the home that will give you a promise, and on arrival, they are cheated, have lost their passports and not get the promised salary," the head of the General Administration of labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not complaining, boss!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money, that they control not only the language of the country, but not in their own language hardly prestrilor can express.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not your fault, but the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only a sound basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school matters.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a teenager, these children and then take the first opportunity to make money.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It is difficult without language skills," they admit.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel humiliated and inferior."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Human rights activists say the law following important aspect.</seg>
<seg id="35">The test only migrants must discard with legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">You do not have that status, so there is no review and no official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome" or "banned for unauthorized access."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get in Russia, an official status.</seg>
<seg id="40">Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Also, costs the legalization of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">A fake registration you can do quickly and only for one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are fake and we are not registered, and then resulting cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow speaks to journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Just to spare no expense for false papers."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some Gefaelschte certificates to certify the completion of the language tests were already beschlaggenommen by employees of federal immigration authority.</seg>
<seg id="48">The fake papers were printed on a color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant who hoped to save the tests to be paid for the document thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this is a migrant worker three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be bought, both officials and civil rights activist, agreed.</seg>
<seg id="52">For the moment, the authorities can guest workers, the case for the first time by the test, only promise that you have time for a language courses.</seg>
<seg id="53">Moreover, in areas are newcomers without language skills offered to people with no active understanding is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="31">Experts calculated that each of the five channels on the black market in illegal weapons around.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2011, a report was submitted by the Center for problem analysis and public administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal State Statistics Service, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the issue of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market, there were reached by the "debt of leaders to do their work with weapons," reads the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The data, according to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% due to theft of weapons production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">, a sales consultant of a gun store, which does not want to be named assured that weapons found during illegal excavations, nobody buys long, because they are outdated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">According to him, it is more likely that traders get the supplies in a weapons cache.</seg>
<seg id="39">On a Dramatis a weapon, a gun is bought by the TT.</seg>
<seg id="40">The weapons will be issued and passed through the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The dealers brings the weapon in the city and sold it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he tells</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The police know, of course, about everything, and therefore, if they cannot meet the plan for the detection of crime, periodically Kontrollkäufe at dealers, illegal arms sales offer," the adviser added.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Buyers and sellers find most familiar with each other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I had seen websites and blogs, as someone who has been on me and I proposed to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would be waiting for me, I would be at a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="48">"To get a gun, do I need a well-known, the contacts," the adviser said. "I have such a well-known, but I trust him."</seg>
<seg id="49">There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go and meet with a code as "by Ivan Iwanowitsch pregnant.-, the daughter lost a tooth."</seg>
<seg id="50">I am currently even on some key rings on a well-known, I trust.</seg>
<seg id="51">He gives me the key rings also just because he knows that I verpfeife him not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former soldiers, Viktor Baranez dabbled in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="54">The schemes have changed, according to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He got a photo album, "everything possible" was shown.</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt like in the luxury goods," the military personnel recalls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer gets loud Baranez not a pig in a poke, but can try everything.</seg>
<seg id="58">I simply do not buy as a potential customer, but only with the seller in the forest, and we have a target.</seg>
<seg id="59">"If I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," said the expert describing the action.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">Shopping from the couch</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Internet search engines show search results to websites and groups in "VKontakte," where weapons are available "for different purposes."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">It will not be required, nor are there any papers face-to-face meetings.</seg>
<seg id="63">"You need just the right amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "fight gun or rifle purchase."</seg>
<seg id="64">There, users to enter their orders and ask questions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">Will also be sold to minors?</seg>
<seg id="66">"Of course, without a license," user "Ivan" asks (direct quote).</seg>
<seg id="67">"A TT. Moscow," the laconic question of "Fedorenkow."</seg>
</p>

<seg id="73">The buyer transfers the money through a bank machines.</seg>
<seg id="74">"When he gets a photo and a description of the captivity of arms," the press spokesman for the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" reported Dmitri Kislow.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">One in four American teenagers sitting behind the cash point of Mc Donald's</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">In the last few days, it came across the United States to massive protests against low wages of Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">No one can predict whether the protests will continue or whether you Distention soon from the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protests are supported by unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary workers almost food- and Wal-Mart, the organizers of the protests aim to form trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this sector of the economy is hardly organized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents in the year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, sales were held in the United States, which attracted millions of customers, which led to Handgemengen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, some Wal-Mart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target audience are low and middle-income people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The goods in the Walmart stores in the interface between 8 and 27% lower than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only at the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart has become one of the largest companies in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Wal-Mart, the goods can often only sell so cheaply, because the employees are paid poorly.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, lack of forklift trucks or handheld scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants in the protests in the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their irritation that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Wal-Mart employees, which earned 9.5 US dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company increased the average wage at 12 dollars an hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars it would cost.</seg>
<seg id="20">The donations are about 1.1% more than they now pay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Walmart wage increases to the customers, every purchase you will only 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">Every year, this would be for you in comparison to now more spending by only 12,39 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it came only in nine states to protests and that gave the company any losses.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period, Wal-Mart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, the Walmart funds from led to the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing not post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees working time and the protest action only "another PR stunt" of the union, which organized the protest, was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free cash!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests continued this week in New York, where your goal, however, were not Walmart stores (which are welcome in this progressive city and therefore does not exist yet), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says that the company should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane williams, a member of the New York City Council</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law stands at 7.25 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fast-food restaurants, according to the minimum wage will be raised, but not too much, and on average, their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">No less than they deserved in this expensive city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How it is possible to come to New York with so little money, is beyond me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American youngsters after school at McDonald's behind the counter, however, the young people still living with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income and planned to stay there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that they have to live with this wage and sometimes even to feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, there are in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper in a commentary, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if they did not know how to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the FIFA Street and Madison Avenue, demanding that the cashier and chefs from fast-food restaurants a minimum wage of $15 an hour), which represents more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">It further demanded the formation of unions in the fast-food industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The U.S. law that prohibits the company leadership to stand in the way of that goal and union members to admonish or being fired.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the corporate governance is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="43">The formation of unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">The main reason is the high staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Unhappy</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Lautstarke protests on this day, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The high point of the protests was an assembly in the middle of the day in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats languages, including City Council member Jumaane williams, said: "McDonald's says it should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, said that "we should come together to support the fast-food employees, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity that everyone deserves New York!."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.</seg>
<seg id="50">But only a few hundred people were on the ground, not all of which are in the fast-food industry, by far, in which tens of thousands of people working in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is still not clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize the masses.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The supporters of modern technologies popular topic of augmented reality is perceived in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Google first showcased in the summer at its annual conference a working model, in November, was then known that Microsoft had applied for a patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the interview with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram izadi, is clear, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.</seg>
<seg id="5">It makes it possible to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- you just please describe their research group, which operates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- we are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, want to extend the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">So far, the race is largely stuck in the phase that work with pixels on flat screens, which sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and predict the radical changes this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console generation sensors and a step forward, and today is sold without any Xbox generation, since all the interested in motion control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- what awaits us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The new generation - although the interaction on a physical level, much is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been decided.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change that work on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.</seg>
<seg id="15">We must let the computer world in our physical world and make them more intelligible.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is not only necessary but that the user, but also its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we could add to the real world much easier by virtual objects.</seg>
<seg id="18">First and foremost we should be Conserva bescheuerten virtual reality helmets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- what do you think about language control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is popular, but it is not overvalued?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- it is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions of privacy, because it is not always inform all others about his actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Virtually every kind of interaction with computers, but each in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, we worked in the area of control of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and tight, experimenting with sprawling gestures.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but from a bracelet Registerd the movements of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is still relatively high, but in theory could be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But, on the whole, however, the future belongs to the joint management types, for example, gestures and language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- like that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- we would ask me, for example, to offer these Sprudeldose?</seg>
<seg id="29">They say it and at the same time Deuten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Normally I say it simply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- that is, they want the user adapts to what can make a machine at the time and what is not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- not necessarily, but there is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that we need to be working in the next time, especially in the development of new types of sensors that allow it to collect comments from people.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, laser sensors in depth because they offer a good resolution, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- which claims it from its work with the Xbox generation sensors on modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">There is a lack of resolution, deep or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, 8-megapixel with a speed of 1000 fps were not bad.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the main thing is not the pipeline itself, but the quality and the depth of the matrix.</seg>
<seg id="41">So are all current technologies are not good enough, because the developers of the algorithms more work.</seg>
<seg id="42">It must not only the resolution along the X and the Y, but also along the z-axis are taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="43">The speed and the number of frames per second are important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The movements of the people are very dynamic and open are the current 30 fps especially for gestures too little.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a lot by now with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For my work I needed just such a device, only without touching control and with more frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- the number of cameras should not be increased?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The new generation - is currently working with three cameras, "one of them, in fact, and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to calculate the object deep.</seg>
<seg id="52">More cameras could solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">Beautiful generation would be a flexible, similar to the system in which we could play with various kamera tendencies to see how that helps us in the three-dimensional investigation of a position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- if I remember correctly, Microsoft in contrast to Google his glasses, not the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality glasses on a daily basis, the best prospects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Of course, it is not pleasant to stop a smartphone in the hand, but I think the neatest variant would be a "temporary" extended reality, in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone,</seg>
<seg id="58">The lens is a personal gadget, and therein lies its strength (private can only see it), but also its weakness, because an enlarged reality through glasses prevented that they can work together with other virtual objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortals.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem, pointing to the critics of this idea: there is no tangible response.</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers your group wants to be at this point?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I am in my lectures often assume that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.</seg>
<seg id="65">An interesting method is the use of second-hand as something unusual projection surface.</seg>
<seg id="66">It takes pressure.</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" something tangible, for example the interference of some grassroots ultrasound beams at a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling, but at the moment there is, as someone who created these fallen over the knuckles.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are tapes for the wrist, which affect the Nervenendungen in the fingers, it is also a potential direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- you have tried to outfox the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">Thinking that it feels it what it should be, if it sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- it is a good idea, so we tried it yet.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here is another issue we will have to fight for a long time, namely, a man who is physically in a closed room to believe, he instead in an open, virtually infinite space; we have been working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms, as well as large balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">So far, the brain can only dream, and we still have many years of work.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive: for researchers on many issues, we are only at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="35">It is not easy to work in new times, according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In today's world it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, to make a cultural contribution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- your work have a distinct style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly the accuracy and clarity of thought.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will have an exhibition with the theme of "the Russian Museum as clowns."</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">Earlier I was social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be so.</seg>
<seg id="42">In a clown that blurs everything and loses his tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">For example, we save the world by writing that everyone has to dress up completely.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now everyone looks at the clothes and focuses on the outside, not the inside of the people.</seg>
<seg id="46">But perhaps we should not give people a hand, but should he spit in the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">The deception will disappear by the disguise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Recently, we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - a cultural city should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, if not I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- commercial art can also be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Today, commercial art should be careful and considerate and flattering.</seg>
<seg id="52">We see the disintegration of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">In the past, people were large groups: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to all.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not one hundred dollar note, which falls each.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now you need to consider thee, whom thou shalt case.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now, every cult star about 100 supporters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- to the performances of Stas Michailow Vollkommen but several thousand!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- to women who have abandoned him sexually, the social sphere plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="60">For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have supporters, and the most important thing is to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.</seg>
<seg id="62">In my youth, I painted these pictures, which hung in a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with images, which are usually only at the end of their careers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Today, there are often Misunderstanding.</seg>
<seg id="65">It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">Consumption has no culture, which is something quite different.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty rejected time and money.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is the culture that I support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Kirill, what is lacking Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- good cultural experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">They say: servant of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not all of you can deal with culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">The real Tzars, it was different, because the Tzars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.</seg>
<seg id="75">In St. Petersburg, we have what that might be, but experts will be blocked the way, as it requires hochrangigerer experts to assess the former right and you open the way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now only one's own taste.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that you have to say that they do not all contemporary art and some other museums therefore Dolmu.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">- What is for you Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">Petersburg - is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a breeding ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">On our stones art can only grow.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers and readers, and that is not right.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are many people who are curious - the exhibitions and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are much less.</seg>
<seg id="84">Art needs to be modern, as at the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is funded by grants, the city of St. Petersburg</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Earth is in danger.</seg>
<seg id="3">Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Caravans of space ships with earth residents on board to find a replacement planet.</seg>
<seg id="5">To save humanity, the important question of how we can continue our plants in weightlessness or on the planet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">There are many choices, in my opinion, no.</seg>
<seg id="7">De facto, there are only two real planet that we could live at least hypothetical.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Namely Mars and Venus," the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While the conditions on Mars are comparatively, there is life on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Life would only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in other words, all possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The question of reproduction in the all the researchers treated first with regard to the flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already a half-century before experiments were conducted with plants.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fourth generation of in-orbit bred peas difference is not in the least of the terrestrial species.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was followed by the breeding of insects, specifically from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study the effect of weightlessness on the development of embryos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It has become a normal chicks.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then the trouble begins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem is that the chickens must stop; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," the director of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Vladimir Sychew explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without a solid surface then precipitated the chicks.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks were not reacting to light and loud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Then they died four days later.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Twice we were hatching chicks and then the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last breeding kennel with animals flew 16 years in orbit.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are, however, will be the "only" Bion homosexual species.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">It was an experiment with rats that were already sent fertilized.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, was found nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="29">"That was the bio-satellites, but again there was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," Vladimir Sychew noted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing the space rats got offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">The issue of reproductive directly in space could not be solved before.</seg>
<seg id="32">The task is difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals which will travel from their natural habitat can't just follow their reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="34">In contrast to animals in the human could in principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens is too abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">Ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.</seg>
<seg id="37">But women fly for 50 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">It was the biggest risk for Tereshkova.</seg>
<seg id="39">The most valuable asset, which owns the humanity of the female body.</seg>
<seg id="40">The gull flew away, and no one on earth could answer the following question: survives the space flight?</seg>
<seg id="41">They will be able to bring a child into this world?</seg>
<seg id="42">"After all, nobody answered this question," space veteran's Watschnadse says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The child's father, Andrijan nikolajew was also cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which was twice in orbit, and even some work outside the space vehicle, gave birth to a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevertheless, a risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only very few cosmonaut after long flights, in which everything went well and they got healthy offspring.</seg>
<seg id="48">"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," cosmonaut Valery Poljakow hero, hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation concludes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And yet, humanity needs to look for new ways of biotechnology, the radiation protection and creating artificial gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The Hydrolabor in the centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in a state of flux the cosmonauts win routine for work in the open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water is the weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Even if adults feel water as a pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is, as the small Ichtyander would testify that life in the country rose from the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get more water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, since crime from birth to the first swimming just over two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is too little time to forget about something," baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">While the weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman cannot happen without gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In the state of weightlessness is the belly and Beckenmuskulatur enormously fast return and with the ability to squeeze the child.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.</seg>
<seg id="61">The birth could, for example, be held in a Spezialkammer to squeeze the child.</seg>
<seg id="62">"But what happens then?," the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">To feel without the natural attraction, the body cannot form the skeleton and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">A newborn child cannot be put in orbit to training as an adult in a suit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It will simply be the absence, which is of vital importance for his life.</seg>
<seg id="67">"This experiment, which we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment will mean that we are going to launch a behinderten, a completely unadapted people to the world," the head of the ethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Igor Pestow, predicts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">So far, the birth of children in the world all is just a theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">At some point, but it becomes a reality, if the inhabitants of the earth to break into their space ships to a distant planet, which is a home for her in the all-born offspring.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Nkú chief: control of the Black system failed due to the fault of the policy.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has in connection with public contracts on good control bodies and adequate laws, however, is in its application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the interview for Aktuálne.cz Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úrad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala says so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"A law is never completely, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that this is not the case," Kala commented on the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A similar outcome is also seems to be a common control by Czech and German investigators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The practice as a negative example he brings the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Necas to the so-called "black system."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass the entrepreneurs with controls - the system now is banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, but the government does not come easy chair, and hinder the Control Board, whose duty is to control the application of the law is, in his work," said Kala notes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel review we started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Put simply, is that the European legislative determines how to handle public contracts to build the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All of this, we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, are the laws we are perhaps even more "rigorous and perfect," but the actual application in Germany in some parameters better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This confirms that it is not enough to create new and more detailed rules. You must also deal with the actual implementation of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How can you help the project? What emerges from this project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Such a joint control could help that we constantly strive to improve laws and the lowering of thresholds and rebalancing if this obviously is not very positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economic means to purchase one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and to exclude illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It may even be that we put the system in this way only with excessive "paperwork," and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the Federal Audit NKÚ, which is similar to us and also has a college, which is basically just a little different but work both authorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The powers are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is, however, a federal state, which means that there are these courts in individual states - that is the German system differs from ours.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The BRH can only monitor federal funding, which is our state funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds that are managed in the counties and municipalities, control of the country's courts are there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What the German legislation, is easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I would compare this without specific information only ungern. Nevertheless Germany is, in some ways, often referred to as a model, but you cannot say that Germany is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The fact that the inspectors are better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">That is not, but as I said, I don't like comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is to say that even those countries that are a model for us, will also have to deal with problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, isn't it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What the Czech legislation, which was important for their authority, the revision of public procurement law, you already feel any impact?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that this novel is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since our controls are in place, you have to expect a certain delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We feel so far more impact in preparation for future inspections, so we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and examined with this nearly 14,000 public contracts and analyzed - here are the changes impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of calls were MODIFIES.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">You can see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with another layer of bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this bill is a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, it may occur, the problem is that the rules are "strict" and can no longer be respected.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the previous rules are a Proofreading unterzogenen people against the winner (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council accountable, so that any breach of contract law is tantamount to violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is it useful, however, to make the law even tougher?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not believe that in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system needs to exclude those who want to attack the system and abuse, and not punish those who committed an error that has an impact on the real decision-making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Where is the way out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">First, let's say, what is not.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother with the controls of the so-called "black" - what exactly does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">The black system has now been banned or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">A bill must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, but the government does not come easy chair, and hinder the Control Board, whose duty is to control the application of the law is, in his work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He said: "we can change the law and allow the matter," but he could not say that we behave as if nothing would.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is for the protection of the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid will be excluded solely because of procedural irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied right - and that is what is missing from us, I think.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think that the world should take place in less than a month?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is one of those disaster messages that we are so happy to jump to humans.</seg>
<seg id="4">With our band The tap tap we make us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or to prevent the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December, they also create a unique project with three concerts against the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can imagine the project closer to our readers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we plan to two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">We want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for the 21st December at 11: 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before, on 20 December, from 9: 00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">The end of the concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">This idea came from whom?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally from me, then we have to flesh out the idea, together with our graficdesigner Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">We don't want to just collect sufficient positive energy to prevent the world, but we like to think along with the public about the state of the world once we pass on to our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the world, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can also support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The band The tap tap has taken together with other performers also called the anthem against the world with the title "doomsday is."</seg>
<seg id="16">Even today, the national anthem on YouTube is very popular. It will be performed at the charity concerts?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, at the very end, provided that everything goes according to plan, and the world is not taking place...</seg>
<seg id="18">The anthem should be sung by all the performers on all three concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, the hymns are -bertragen together in a direct circuit of the Czech television live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The text of the anthem of the company HANÁK, who also played the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also sings with Xindl X...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you get to work with two?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We will also cooperate with other leading figures in the Czech culture scene, that we realize many charity events and concerts.</seg>
<seg id="23">We are trying to involve us, these people in our projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was clear that the majority of them are interested in cooperation with us, and have fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The purpose of the proceeds from the concerts will benefit against the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre.This Studeo, we are already working six years together with the tap in the jedlicka Institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">The students of jedlicka Institute will be cared for by editors that help you with various leisure activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since the students do not have the resources to search for the editors, we want to help you in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the context of the completion of the jedlicka Institute, a private building in which we draw with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At every concert a number of groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what criteria they have chosen this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">In Prague, for example, China ucitelé, support lesbiens, Illustratosphere occur with Dan Czech, the tap tap, Marián Bango and JIRÍ Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything else you can find on the internet page www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Similar "big events" are also planned for the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we stand for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, we would also like to join in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States, this would also like to combine with appearances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Their foreign plans are not just small, thus far, they have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The TAP is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">As they deal with this logistical and organisational?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. We must also, of course, with many instrument suitcases and other Lugage...</seg>
<seg id="43">Nonetheless, it has always worked without problems, CSA and British Airways have always been very good to us that sometimes I wonder sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">By their foreign travel, so you have a comparison, as it did in the individual countries with accessibility looks, how to deal with people with disabilities</seg>
<seg id="46">How have you seen these things so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than us, we were just in Russia that witnesses in the East is still in its infancy.</seg>
<seg id="48">Vis-à-vis Prague Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is not even there, of course, is that it leaves a wheelchair user, for example, in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, there are clubs that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are still many things on which we depend is...</seg>
<seg id="53">It is important to note, however, that an improvement in the situation still depends on the efforts of the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities move independently in a public space, the museum can use toilets, etc.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not customary for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in the public arena, we are involved with the band The Tap Tap are slightly ahead of the West.</seg>
<seg id="56">In respect of the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when the great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks, things will really start to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far, these are only cases of particular desire strong personalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The TAP is currently very popular. But if we take a couple of years back: what was your motivation in 1998 to start a band?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Then I started as a supervisor in the jedlicka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am a musician and saxophone games I founded together with a colleague, a music AG.</seg>
<seg id="61">Oh, and by the time is that, as our moderator to say láa Angelovic, tended to get a little out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The band was known, but only in the last few years, and I am wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that the cooperation helped with well-known singers; we also have also begun to advertise for us.</seg>
<seg id="64">We become aware that if you are doing something and to the outside, this is not your performance in a way that does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to EU funding we can afford überdies good editors, high-tech equipment and gapahuk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It was their goal, with the tap tap so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning, I have sensed the potential that we can go about things differently.</seg>
<seg id="68">Show business is now often copied one another.</seg>
<seg id="69">That is on its way, because everything Logicamente new is viewed with caution and accepted until some time later.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of the audience usually is, of course, compassion; it is only natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because no lonely and abandoned Przemyslowego are people with disabilities, and we would regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who can live a normal life and develop, if you have the funds to do so.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if people with disabilities does something, this is not just for themselves, but for the whole society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">It was for this success, that you are a strong leader, as we hear from many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If you want to do something good, you must not compromise on many things, and also needs a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think this is completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you then have to find that they have tested twice a week, to undertake preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then quickly extinguished the enthusiasm among many.</seg>
<seg id="79">So it works but everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Tap tap Receptionisten currently has 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of those were from the outset, since 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one: láa Angelovic.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group. The people come and go, but this is something we cannot avoid.</seg>
<seg id="84">Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Will be held the day before the predicted doomsday, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Venues are: incheba Arena, Prague and Brno / Fléda Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">All three venues will be connected to the final circuit via live together and it sounds a common interpretation of the anthem "doomsday," the band The tap tap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The concert is to raise the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional disabled education center that is to be created under the name STUDEO in jedlicka Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years for free tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week Poland was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the twentieth member of this space agency. Poland is the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects.</seg>
<seg id="4">Poland's path to space began much earlier, however.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts in the space, but they were not always understood.</seg>
<seg id="6">I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Academy, where the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "entrance to the Space Exploration."</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience cold, however, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld won in 1934 for "at the entrance to the Space Exploration" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie Andr- Louis Hirsch and donated Prix rep Hirsch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of space was honored by the fact that one of the crater was named on the side of the moon erdabgewandten after him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In 1925, a rail trolley was built in Poland, for a rocket propulsion was planned.</seg>
<seg id="13">The author of the draft and the details of this project, remained unknown.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not yet clear whether the missile would be used to start or stop the trolley.</seg>
<seg id="15">The details come exclusively from the contemporary press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish Outpour began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research, the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia resulted in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is clear from the documents that the research was reached in the stage of practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">The research, however, has been suspended by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, the ING appeared in the press Rohozinski. On the draft of a photoelectric hunting missile, and the following year was the work of "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna Aquest rakietobomba be the author's" Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects dealing with the military use of Raketenantriebs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war, all the projects have been coordinated with the military use of missile technology from the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, but his work was finished by the start of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other items to the space appear after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">The first mention of this society is in 1954 in the November issue of the journal problemy, in the four major articles of the space.</seg>
<seg id="26">The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of an aerospace company.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA sought accession to the 1951-based International Federation for space, and indeed the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956 full member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year the first PTA, presiding omnicki Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) was, vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had this office until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956, the PTA was instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type, the RM-1 was completed in 1957, the first flight took place on October 10, 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, an improved version of the RM-1A, was built in 1959, and flight tests began in the Bledowska Desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The missile was 1.4 meters long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">A further development stage should be in a position to make real scientific work - the missile RM-34 should at an altitude of up to 14.5 km and reach for the observation of high winds.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 1962, however, the further development has been discontinued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In the first missiles of the type RM Meteor 1 missile was developed in 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was designed as Zweistufenrakete, their total length fraud 510 cm and start weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1b and -1c) which differed from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The meteor 1A rocket had a room with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1b about 0.34 liters and meteor-1C about 0.62 per litre.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum altitude fraud in all three types, 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 missile was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then the versions meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Also worthy of the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland participated in the framework of the programme Interkosmos space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was second after the Czechs Vladimír Conditii Interkosmonaut.</seg>

<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on charitable work.</seg>
<seg id="3">That decision provoked a lively debate among the public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, with rampant financial speculation, hand in hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept of a state is to understand where the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper imported goods in the economic competition, offers the competition "to seize a larger share of the market and to increase its profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a large-scale that for most companies to move their production abroad or to purchase cheap, or to abandon their business, but the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labor costs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the private capital has no social responsibility, and thus no responsibility for it caused by unemployment, the rising government spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, to be replaced by the overall social economic and social damage.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this stage.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brutal practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce the social level of their own people and thus artificially to lure foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words: the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is particularly applicable law changes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The objective of these measures is to impose its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is due to economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by reducing workers' rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is a growing poverty and increasing gap between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are a few years ago public food outlets for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people affected is in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the wake of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy are regularly to cases in which workers will receive a wage so low that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of the German federal employees auxiliary staff.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures virtually all of the EU's southern states will certainly be in the same state, where the people are obliged under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or darben for a pittance on the fringes of society, and to hope that eventually will go private investment capital in the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here is the question of where this capital?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty of a country moving in the other; or the capital from remains the same, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa for the workers at a fraction of the wages of work.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to all of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the government should not be involved with capital on its own economy, and that a planned economy will lead to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital narrowly insists on its position that the state cannot interfere in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">But then we have to ask whether the private capital the policy and the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even draws.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here is the clear answer: yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, a legislative, in which everything, but nothing is almost criminally punishable by law.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department of Finance instructed private, dense with industry interdependent law firms with the preparation of draft legislation.</seg>
<seg id="35">These bills will be passed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All the violence comes not from the people, from the western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Liberal Democrats currently Evidently Council quickly in a situation as you appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey 'describes: "the state was for a long time in the fall, and the offices were filled with violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Against soft money through illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.</seg>
<seg id="39">The corruption grown incontinent, and the people have purchased went to vote in the elections... "" people with character applied for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul... "" really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine is in this difficult situation an autocracy, and that a strong man should be chosen... "Appian thought while at Pompey, but the strong man Caesar, which replaced the democracy permanently by the dictatorship was eventually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As it turns out, is based in today's society, as well as in the antiquity of the ruthless preference of his own advantage, not paying attention to overall social interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is already, by its very nature, is not in a position to identify and implement the benefit of the whole of society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result, now as then, is an unparalleled decadence of elites who is not in the slightest of in-depth reforms.</seg>
<seg id="43">The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we need to look at the reckless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Seen from the current state of the downfall of the regime can be seen in favor of liberal democracies as some pause, in the next round already looms.</seg>
<seg id="45">Especially appalling is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are already today, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution, or at least not permanent.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to put the social level of the population down.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore system.</seg>
<seg id="49">The only solution is to increase targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the state.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film Argo: if the worst is that Hollywood call</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979, a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">For their release demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which maintained over the decades, the patronage of his regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the US government, there was no positive way out of this situation, they could not afford to raise the Shah on board, which damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, she was not in a position to enforce in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure of the violent attempt the hostages were only made things worse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations had been conveyed by the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fate of the hostages at home caused a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat by Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film Argo of the film director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the United States a small part of victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy employees.</seg>
<seg id="12">This came after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA has succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; an extravagant story to cover their true identity helped them - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, supposedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction movie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combining the genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The experts for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">The camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in trade magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Afflecks film is a special combination of several Filmgenres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but also a so-called "Bob Movie," the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean's Eleven.</seg>
<seg id="20">This change in the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs will be shown, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which ironically and repositionings Vollkommen so easily.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table in the office corridors, on the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck is with this movie a remarkable start to his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From a losing a respected actor and director has become, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">ARGO is his third feature film, the thriller not childsplay (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without gnade (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, is not in the director's native Boston.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that contrasted with the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada. "</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes in the movie play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the entrance to sequence the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, and conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when the story somewhere.</seg>
<seg id="30">Affleck achieved a similar effect with his team with fictional scenes (the wrong film in a bazaar in Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director also has had to deal with that history is not many in the cinematic sense exciting scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">He has been working with the little but quite successful, sometimes after helping the reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis averted at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or even the chase on the runway seem contrived something).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is to have its overly broad distribution, which is driven by the need to act to show too many places too much.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood Biofrühstück Baillon, although their figures were worthy but more space, and they are in the film is far from alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Afflecks film to lose traction. It is a movie that you watch with some interest and can goutieren the design and a thriller from the 1970s retro-style.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, he has inspired enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of today are in some way living piece of history and as proof of how excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, is it enough, however.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"On this idea brought us the recently by the European Union's plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of the large European companies," Patrik, who cares about the history of the organisation of the poll, told the newspaper právo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nominees absurdities, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until then, the women with life-insurance companies an advantage, because they represent for the insurance companies objectively less risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"More incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol fuel, which is in its wake, naturschädigend FUTHERMORE banning the reliable mercury thermometers, just because they have a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive to the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Bananas must be 14 cm long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The EU decides apparatus under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule will be represented by one or several member countries (Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to veto threat with the demands of Czech banks).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas the highest trade in the EU must be at least 14 inches long and no "curvature anomaly" must have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission defended themselves with the argument that they harmonisiere only the fragmented national standards that would impede the trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The standards for fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries already with the suggestion that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation of the past year, according to balloons on sale will be equipped with the note that children under eight years are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU berief to an American study, the balloons are the leading cause of death for the suffocation deaths of children.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">There are also some odd ideas at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official function in the EU must not be used because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, the name Macedonia and must instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) say.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies to the territory of a member country.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU set the Hoechstvolumen on food supplies, which was located on the day of our EU accession on the territory of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the volume for canned mushrooms, a large fine Wofür hanging over us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive the money that they have no sea, or from the idea to provide funding for applications for funding.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but from Prague.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">"We are still at a disadvantage that we have no sea.</seg>

<seg id="28">Since the Czech Republic is another way to sea ports, according to the heart of the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.</seg>
<seg id="29">The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far, that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Funding for applications for funding offered the communities of the Ministry of Regional Development, under the leadership of Prime Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU) and, in particular, should be earmarked for the establishment of aid money to Brussels.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The people want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," Okamura said.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mr Senator, how does one get the idea to run for the office of president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">I am not talking about being a senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If it would work in our country without problems, I would stand anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can no longer see the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free, be increased during the people's taxes and the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambitions to become a politician.</seg>
<seg id="7">If I see something I don't like it, then I try to propose a solution to change this.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I'm over 40, and independent and party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the Senate, they have managed, and then straight on the road to the castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">They will not return to their constituents back?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I said to myself the whole time that I am going to take the fight to the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.</seg>
<seg id="12">Later I made it and said that I shall be a candidate for the office of president, if I am elected senator.</seg>
<seg id="13">My goal is not function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the problem is not only that we as a people shouting in the pub and in front of the television, but anyone who wants to make a difference down.</seg>
<seg id="16">The media who want to steal the credit, and the lies to confuse the freedom of speech with freedom.</seg>
<seg id="17">For me, it was claimed, for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant of JIRÍ Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We are talking about their visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">The battle for the castle you have included the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retroactive asset declarations about 20 million kronor.</seg>
<seg id="20">To do so, you need to change the law.</seg>
<seg id="21">As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and it could be enforced.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, this will be rejected, and on the population.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent party loser I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of any party that can do what is best for our country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do they see themselves as human in politics rather right or left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From Czech perspective, it seems to me that the more people see me.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me, this right-to-left thinking, but it is totally irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, it is important that we continue to come.</seg>
<seg id="31">I am not talking about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right; I want to unite the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am always publicly any good solution, even if these KSCM or of the ODS, and I will speak out against bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">You do not like it when someone described them as populists.</seg>
<seg id="34">But it's not confirmed by what you just said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If you are in a company, a business plan, then you will have a great goal and a vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that you want to approach.</seg>
<seg id="37">You can call it as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world, or they have been discussed by experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without support in the House, you still have only keywords.</seg>
<seg id="39">And so, they will be in the long-term policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think that if you just long enough with the speeches, people will be able to push through, for example, the material and criminal liability?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other option.</seg>
<seg id="42">And to try to convince politicians, journalists and the general public, to bring them to our side, to achieve these goals.</seg>
<seg id="43">As president, it is not a problem for me to call on the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to anchor the Materialistic and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And if the aforementioned would then have to say why they oppose it.</seg>
<seg id="45">A strong personality, highlighting abuses can put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take only once the direct election of the president, who was a credit to the public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I can say categorically that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the policy, I have only just begun and try to find my program for the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">I always try to assess the things themselves, and if it doesn't work, then I go in six years in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm not a savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that I do nothing; therefore, I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether you do not want to run for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I have spoken with radim urzdzeniach Jancura, however, rejected due to overwork.</seg>
<seg id="55">I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová that uncovered the fraud in the trade, with light heating oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">My candidacy, I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of eligible voters went to the polls, not at all, and those who are gone, have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, we are now only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.</seg>
<seg id="60">Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision for the direct election of mayors and district chief men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">You think about setting up your own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have been thinking about that, because I don't have time to review the past every potential party member, and that it does not have the money to do so.</seg>
<seg id="63">I have no money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">They have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You talk about financial statements, what would your?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I value my private assets to about 60 million CZK.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is about 10 million value, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a superb Škodu, about a million value. And then I still have a few million in the bank account.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he drove in a car, Galant to women and, at the same time it was fighting against evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">They say that they want to change the Republic, but your own money, you don't want to invest in it.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I don't have 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Should I do about debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I have already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors have shown that my program does not too much interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign will be covered basically through my salary as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But the senator salary alone, I could not live; so I could be my son, not the English school finance costs 30,000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">They are more than entrepreneurs to have their livelihoods?</seg>
<seg id="81">They said that they will not go back to these activities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But that is not linked to the level of salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, I pulled my activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">So, for example, is my deputy in the spring, managing director of the travel agencies.</seg>
<seg id="85">The people want to see me as a Samaritan rescues the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I must however life of something.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see them again," said Lisette Verhaig Passantin says, on the edge of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">And, Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby major operating says: "it is beautiful, but already, the house."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder what we still need a library.</seg>
<seg id="5">All have Internet, iPad and e-books.</seg>
<seg id="6">No man is still at one of these old-style libraries, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse tiesnavou needy Sleepingbag, a little town on the outskirts of Rotterdam, strange record holder.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 80,000 residents' education has the lowest rate in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to counteract this stupid, we decided a few years ago, contribute to the general education and to reduce the seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro, seem pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the education campaign.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so the city fathers recognized that there is only one way to be the statistic Mr: a library needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">, winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of the great bold bar graphs and producer of funny, often cynical buildings took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared to the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under my arm and a smile on the face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the jury still looked puzzled and shoulders, wincing Esspecially Freche Maas of his exquisite gifts to the size of a pyramid and founded an actionist ended his speech with the words: "dear municipality."</seg>
<seg id="14">It is, therefore, my proposal for the mountain of books spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the 30 million mountain is built up.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is part of a revitalization project, including garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few are living and adjacent row houses with a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November, "the second prize was awarded the" Best Library of NL 2012. "</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">So the faceless town retort that offer had not so far more than a post-modern peša and a stunned ugly Hall, behind its white walls, one could be inclined to suspect a Molkereifabrik, a piece of contemporary architecture is richer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Above all, however, has now spijkenisse on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to the book.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: books Eldorado under glass.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is true that there is an elevator that leads through the mountains, but the real joy and read the fußläufigen climb up the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Rundum glazed interior is bright and clear, and the elegant streetlights burned Klinkerboden unequivocally speak the language of a public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is already looking for park bench, dog and soccer-playing boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere, books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle of a large, dark space, which is usually ugly and impersonal is winy Maas says."</seg>
<seg id="29">We have asked the classic room configuration on its head and read by enclosing the area from the inside to the outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior of the books: this is used in the middle office, library, the Internet Chess Club, environmental and clean house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A special treat is the black bookshelves, time, time parapet wall Cowling, rose close countries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Look, feel and smell.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even hardbitten architects, engineers and construction material and the unknown whether shake of the head.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycled materials," Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality spijkenisse said, at the request of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we have encountered in a farming friesländischen one day on a waste product from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years we have used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a Milli meters thin plastic woven as the root surface.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is cheap and efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin KROME- holds a two seasons, then it is ripe for the rubbish bins.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities to four inches thick plates.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that smells a little after new cars and a little after athletic footwear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 stufen has reached the summit.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journeys in the cafe will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.</seg>
<seg id="43">They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in the literature Mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"You would not believe it, but this is in spite of the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heated and chilled with geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the books mountain is under a glass of fall, the sun itself appears only briefly on sunny days in the interior.</seg>
<seg id="48">The broad Holzleimbinder available across the glass facade, serve as shadows and catch a large part of the sun's rays.</seg>
<seg id="49">The climate is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest fully automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry already ventured into the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also the TCM Cynthia Bogarde, which she described as "the Boekenberg Spijkenisses overdue soul."</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: the opening a few weeks every resident has been invited to donate a book from his personal collection.</seg>
<seg id="55">For the time being, so that should be filled again the optical gaps in the not-yet-fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept has taken root.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are filled up obenhin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," architect winy Maas says.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think that thanks to our invitation each now has a certain relationship with this new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">And if it is only to grace.</seg>
<seg id="62">This is the pinnacle of Menyelisihi MVRDV who are called in the jargon identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse has literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">So young and uneducated they may be.</seg>
<seg id="65">This is a starting point for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "German must play a greater role."</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine abstained.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then to Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.</seg>
<seg id="8">Germany must now be given its special relationship with Israel but cautious.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, as was to set up a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was, after all, enforced by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany will find it difficult to take on important international issues a clear position?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it's true.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy from a policy, which has been managed by the United States, a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German is therefore find themselves trapped in the middle.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected that you play a more independent role, but they are not.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, such as France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What does a "normal" foreign policy it from a German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent from those of the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, in other words from the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests have had influence on the attitude of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote at the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be cautious, the public, but also to the elites in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">In any case, which plays a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not want to attach a lot of weight, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in any case it plays an important role in German reections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by focusing on major decisions, abstained in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe in Europe, and even in the US there is great sympathy for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I do not believe that such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps Germany is a game that even some respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The US, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">As a result of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite sympathetic to the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But due to the political situation here, the government can, of course, does not represent the position publicly.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real differences are not always as they appear.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is by no means an audience of Netanyahu's policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Germany will find it hard to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the main partner in the EU, on the other side?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case now.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they can't be part of a broader line and must instead expedite things from their own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">This is precisely the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even for the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This has always been a sensitive issue.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I believe that the German clear is that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany sees itself in the role as a major international player, will play a key role in Germany at all?</seg>
<seg id="54">Like Germany or the leadership still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still not accustomed, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time when Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">This makes it the German.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Now, the influence of the United States in European politics, from the EU fills the vacuum at the moment but not who is otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you do not like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular, c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="1">"Trademark protection in China:" if Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">In China, where it officially registered designation, nothing to do with the company.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, as long as it enjoys protection actions, such as the actual name.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then it is not clear whether they will be proven right.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It will be more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in copyright violations in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week a new case lands on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The copying a few additional letters enough so that they must register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Lu Gucci, Prada will be simply from Gucci-Prada Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">German companies are also copied legally in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Patt hole opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On September 14, 2010, there was a Chinese company that trademarks protect Zegna DF Puma, a name that is also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That the Chinese are world champions in the copy and the injured intellectual property, is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities, there are multistory department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his clients, he goes against Chinese companies from the trademark office officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">For women, the fishing rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are aware of any debt</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"This is geschäftsschädigend, you have to fight it," Patt hole.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand will be diluted, the only position disappears, the image damage is huge."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries in the millions, especially on expensive flagship products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market research company clsa China is with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third-largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But DELETION dubious entries in the commercial register are difficult to achieve and go in the money.</seg>
<seg id="26">Up to nine years, the proceedings drag, with uncertain results.</seg>
<seg id="27">Patt hole reported cases in which the court rejected claims, because the name is reported to the long-term "market has become a reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money, because he injured his brand in China, stalemate hole says.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Famous cases involving graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer SANY, the company, which recently took over the German concrete pump Bauer Preparare master.</seg>
<seg id="32">The bottom line is that the Chinese must now use an emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Volvo buyer geely -ecstasy- used a blue and white logo, which recalled BMW; the dispute was resolved, geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashion maker Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which caused the famous crocodile in the other direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.</seg>
<seg id="36">The trademark office in Beijing CTMO admits that there were 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the past year, but it was returned by the "emergency situation in the workflow to normality."</seg>
<seg id="38">So the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure was dropped by 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Nearly 57,000 such cases have completed it, 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, waiting in the office still 81.500 appeals to completion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In contrast to deal</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year, more than 1.4 million applications received by the CTMO trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record, meant that China would lead to the tenth consecutive year, the list of new registrations in all over the world, the authority.</seg>
<seg id="45">That holds true even for the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="46">2011 1.8 billion yuan had been taken on charges.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simplified, which means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To address it costs a lot, as in the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese Plagiator.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Germans were able to ensure that its illegal manufacturing imitation of motor vehicle parts was dug.</seg>
<seg id="51">But he continues to be followers of the Chinese rights to the brand.</seg>
<seg id="52">You have failed, because the family name in Germany could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical specialities says in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The Trademark Office CTMO rejected the appeal of the Munich as well.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the next two instances of Freudenberg got it right, but the process opponents continue fighting until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">We have to be careful award</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: "the process is very time-consuming, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs could not quantify the company archives have even seen a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"That shows how much there is," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers in the Far East, even threatening to spill back to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Then, if there is imitators vulnerable brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This business has long since abandoned the group, but he was able to avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"You have to be careful," says Wentzler award.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole Council German companies in dealings with China to be very careful.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to international trademark rights to leave, but the fact that foreigners should "everything is worthy somehow, even in China," as Wentzler says.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact, if Freudenberg under Chaiselongue in the last act of his trademark drama, then we would have to pay license fees for the other side's name Wentzler said.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we will be relegated to the segment of the market.</seg>

<seg id="36">The bacterial STI, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea Tripper ().</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral STI, humane Pappilomaviren Vaak, HIV or hepatitis is.</seg>
<seg id="38">Crab and itch belong to the parasitic STI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who are the main groups concerned?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and Tripper, especially among men who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of Germany reported cases of syphilis transmitted through sexual contacts between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the heterosexual adults chlamydia infections, trichomonaden, Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren identifies common sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV among heterosexuals adults here is relatively small, about 20 percent of all new HIV infections in this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among the young chlamydia infections occur far more frequently than other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European surveys, three-quarters of the cases involve young people between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">Here are also humane Pappilomaviren among young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">As the number of infections developed?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch Institute in 1697 diseases in 2001 at 3698 diseases in 2011, more than doubled.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV infections since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The symptoms are pointing to a sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints to urinate, discharge, Unterbauchschmerzen and blisters or warts.</seg>
<seg id="55">However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can you protect yourself?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100 percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">As part of the pathogen of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infection and close physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">As a result, experts recommend especially for frequently changing sex partners regular examinations.</seg>
<seg id="60">Most of the STI diagnosed early can be cured and avoid late consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least, the fees, the ersingt Choir in all of Germany, things are coming together.</seg>
<seg id="62">"We have already sent a total of about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni," Annette lennartz, the chairman of the association says.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village itself Zodwa dlamini managed a self-conscious and enforcement of strong women, the money from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">They also worry that the orphans, well under one of the grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The gogos, as the old women in Zulu, the base of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give you a roof over their head and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear every day, just in time for the school.</seg>
<seg id="67">Anyone who has come to the house to protect Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid for by the association as well as the two cooks in the kitchen every day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Moreover, "Voices for Africa" launched a Nähschule, built two Hühnerhäuser and organized jointly with the American Health Organisation PSI that many in the village have an HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not a foregone conclusion, because the disease is so obvious in the whole country, it is silent on the dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 wives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"AIDS is an absolute taboo," Annette lennartz says, "because it has to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III is known for his excessive lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Among other things, it is also the state-sanctioned life form that the virus has spread in recent decades so quickly.</seg>
<seg id="76">But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus in the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms, there would be around every corner, Annette lennartz says, "but the rarely used.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is very different - flesh to flesh. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">To promote cultural exchanges, travels the imbongi choir every two to three years through the South Africa and sings songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many know at the southern tip of the black continent, from the days of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of white, the songs in a black language sing - so much recognition not only brings humor and joy, but has also been abgetrotzt some fierce border soldiers a few tears.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The journey will always Esitjeni, where the singer to visit their children.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even if the small village on maps little place in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"After Esitjeni, as is the light," said the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And if you return the 8733 kilometres, pounding the singers in the rehearsal room on the east, then lights there too.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="50">Our insights into space: the most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei began a year later to the star.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes were growing - and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">It allows all equal in the eyes of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The inner workings of the Gran Canarias telescopio on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone, the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">Detriment of cheap construction: the telescope is already in his elevation angle - and in his limited mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its special feature: the high-earning power.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is despite relatively low - namely diameter mirror - the world's largest mirror telescopes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the help of a radio telescope in arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers to hear it all for alien signals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here is the Very Large Telescope, which is worthy of its name.</seg>
<seg id="69">With its total four mirrors the telescope can also ensure its designed function within prescribed limits in the middle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Also on the Chilean HACER Observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.</seg>
<seg id="71">Its main mirror to include a whopping 42 yards - and be set on nearly 1,000 mirror elements together.</seg>
<seg id="72">With photos until 2018, however, is to be expected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii was seen as the biggest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">They offer two levels ever, with an average of 10 meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory near them, even with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Also on the summit of Mauna Kea to a new, huge telescope with a mirror - an average of 30 meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is here on an illustration.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="78">The main impressions from all the space telescope Hubble delivers, however.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since April 24, 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope search for extrasolar planets, particularly those that are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">On February 2, 2011 was announced by NASA that 1,235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission began.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the last launch preparations are documented on the Kepler space telescope.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="83">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot until 2018 aboard a Ariane5 rocket into space.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope to search for light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume that ice also exists at the South Pole of Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there is no reliable data, as the Messenger circles far closer to the North Pole to the planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements hingedeutet have for decades that there is on the ice.</seg>
<seg id="89">The MESSENGER probe launched in 2004 - the first, which revolves around the Mercury, the scientists have now certainty.</seg>

<seg id="12">Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, is not much, except that she speaks perfect English and Aserisch and is very durable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Final stop is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">The small town flaunts powerfully to meeting the architecture of Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists from Europe hardly come here to tread the directions from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku.</seg>

<seg id="17">The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has arrived here in the province.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the vehicle to the tourist attraction.</seg>

<seg id="30">Equally dubious about the wording of the "insult to the people" is forbidden.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?</seg>
<seg id="32">Open to interpretation, like so much in the draft, which Morsi will be put to the signature and presented to his words "very soon" the Egyptians to the referendum.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">"The revolution has returned."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The opposition formed for weeks about the power of the Islamists.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the Charter to fall, even before it can enter into force.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The revolution is back and we will win," Hamdin Sabbahi Drittplatzierter, said of the presidential election.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The Koran is our constitution."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to the counter-demonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the Nile River in Cairo University.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret to the success of the country might have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a selection of mature cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">One place you in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sports clothing.</seg>
<seg id="6">And they leave a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">As it is the smell of rakfisk nasenbetäubenden, one of the great delights of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, just won't go away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which is fermented, it depends on how you would like to stink its fish - up to a year in water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">When the darkness comes in Norway on the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians to flock here in Fagernes, it is this, well, really very impressive specialty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"You can eat it raw and provides it with a glass of aquavit," Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "rakfisk General" organized the festival says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All around us people eat small fish cubes and make large quantities of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"People don't like the Mansche aquavit more than the rakfisk," Harvard said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The spirits can replace the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I eat a few bites.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it avoids the rakfisk CROPANI in nose, he is not a bad thing - such as sushi, quite a long bus ride.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cool and wet fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the depths of winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and then - no doubt aided by alcohol subdued senses - consumed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians forced in search of work, to leave their country and immigrated mainly in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, drawn by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even from Sweden, the old rivals, which was not too long ago, much richer than Norway, ieceotaji flows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strict smelling part of the Norwegian history.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.</seg>
<seg id="25">But everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway is not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here hates it still Anders Breivik, to name names - those racist right-wing extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, referred only to the "incident on July 22."</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegians do find it difficult to accept that someone is in their peace-loving country to such brutal killings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway has been around since the early 1970's growth is one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," Anna, our waitress who Cuocere round trays with seasoned rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are a - as they say - prudent people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Her English is like that of most people here.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are not very angeberisch, we may not emerge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very careful - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As with all money raised in the years leading up to the world economic crisis, which they had not, Norway gave his wallet firmly closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And, of course, rakfisk Easting," she adds with light-hearted laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am in the snow and instead on another court - from rakfisk I have enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">As a moose burgers is definitely something I enjoy. The juicy meat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But in the evening, the stinky fish on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several locations that can organize a rakfisk dinner, guests in the best sense of smell - or perhaps the most challenging - Ospreys votes.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a live TV circuit with a fly-shirted show master, which is surrounded by plates with rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="44">The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What number you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Here are our points, "Harvard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">They applauded and laughed.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls overwhelmed by his chair, possibly from the aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">But perhaps it is the tough reality of the whole fish.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While Mexico's President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration will grant analyzed by the BBC, the challenges facing him and the mixed feelings of his people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel, which was sealed off several important transport routes in the capital and chaos in the streets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The goal, however, it was not to interfere with commuter on the way to work, but also to prevent demonstrators trying to reach the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Präsidentenbinde and take over the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He faces a complex task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon, Mexico can prove economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has claimed in the past six years, as many as 60,000 lives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office, the US President Barack Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he went with the US president at eye level, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided over the new head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A direct Nalezy</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the remote town of Valle del Bravo reminds you, for example, to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Residents of the resort to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">To reach the city, you can drive on the highways, Pena Nieto, construction and pose a major improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that were once here.</seg>
<seg id="17">With his name plaques hanging outside of a modern sports centre and a spectacular interactive museum on climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect from him real and lasting change," his friend and political ally LAX Gabriel Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party, the PRI's Pena Nietos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular, with regard to the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Congressman LAX admits that the party after 12 years of the capture of the Presidential Palace outside of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accusations by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He is a very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was a great statesman, above all, he is also someone who can listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Subsequently, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast could not be on the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo.</seg>
<seg id="27">The town lies hidden under highway bridges and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature.</seg>
<seg id="29">Earlier this year, the military has been switched to combat the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On a dirt wasteland near a large garbage dump the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been killed in the last two years left.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the administration of Governor Pena Nieto Mexico were in the state killed about 1,000 women - a statistic that surpasses even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is for the violence and the killings of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is dealing with the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="33">But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete building, typical of the rundown district, is fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as she showed me photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna.</seg>
<seg id="35">The official version of events in 2010, according to Mariana committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="36">But her family believes that she was killed by her partner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs that they had been beaten, and the body rigid had already used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While her mother tells her story, an image of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is right next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is precisely this, so the family, you have until now refused.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The authorities have treated me as if I were a humbug, troublemakers, whingers.</seg>
<seg id="42">You want to accept their verdict and the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But this is not possible, if there were so many flaws and failures," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">If President Pena Nieto, on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde, he also has a great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to take care during his tenure, especially around this problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope that as president, he is, as he was as governor," the congressman císla LAX in Valle del Bravo says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">But that is exactly what fear the families of the victims in Ciudad neza most.</seg>

<seg id="1">My Mexican-American identity crisis.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Many people have been forced by the lack of opportunities to leave Mexico</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - call them in difficult times, he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport control, as confusion in me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs point to two queues: one for "mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds, unsure to what I should go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in central California and was my whole life, "Mexicans."</seg>
<seg id="9">An ethnic symbol - just as my friends in Boston, "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, I opted for "Mexican-American."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or dashes.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just Americans.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish, at least good enough to compete in this language on both ends of the interviews.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not Conserva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about those moment this week, as the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda were all those issues, which are expected to meet the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to remain in Mexico to emigrate rather than in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would like to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc modeled after the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against Mexico's drug cartels, although he gave no details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States in 1848 a fell in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun, forced to leave them more than half its territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, the thinking in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event will not be overlooked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore, once a US government official also performs only mildest criticism of Mexico, you can hear it - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children Montezumas go on the war path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">But the greatest challenge in Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Want to talk about resentment?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not do that.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio life, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parents or grandparents part - got no chance in Mexico and in the direction of North emigrated.</seg>
<seg id="32">And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And although we are living the American dream, perhaps now visited good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is blurred may sometimes, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is clearly in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class do not like.</seg>
<seg id="39">This is based on reciprocity.</seg>
<seg id="40">They look at us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">In your opinion of our existence is a symbol of failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And then we would not now caught behind the silk curtain, with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and, as a child, legally in the United States, was reminded me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans resent them.</seg>
<seg id="46">While it is an American citizen, she sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">But many Mexican Americans Campane, have the feeling to belong neither to the one nor to the other country.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte love, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">It has the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes it even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated bourgeoisie want to take their connections to the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">You Mexican Americans want to use as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico to defend their interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Now.</seg>
<seg id="56">This will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many wounded feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And given the unfair distribution of incomes, the rampant corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I am afraid, because it by Cackling alone, friends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">This is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans bear a grudge for how their family members were discussed until not so long ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old battles, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas udovít could prove to be a cornerstone for peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There can be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest bloody events such Movimientos seem to nip in the bud.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the midst of the usual recriminations were countless buildings to rubble and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them killed civilians, and six Israelis - and the first time rockets are taken from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, changed the Middle East around them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could eventually find their end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war that neither lost nor gained will</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, seems optimistic given the current situation than anything else.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the 21 November agreed ceasefire holds, this week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007 will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although his group itself has seen large losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although several Hamas leaders are killed and packed the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in a dense desolatesten bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, wins the Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">As Islamists won in the Arab world, Hamas can learn powerful and wealthy friends on their side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once seen as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has seized on the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren embossing could face the Stürzung Bashar Assad's, to Jordan, where Hamas-allied threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi inhabitants - by far the strongest and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the Brotherhood is with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders are more dependent on people's views.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic negotiations Hamas could prove to be a player who can not be from Israel and the United States wooed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms Hamas is no longer dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli anti-missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove themselves, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">For a while, at least, Israel will not be able to sleep peacefully.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic terms the United States hold firm on its position, many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who ignored the peace process to a large degree.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed 30 Israelis have since 2004, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the closing plants, which lost in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. This will protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared as illegal under international law, however, will continue to expand.</seg>
<seg id="31">Netanyahu as well. His Likud party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on January 22, Avigdor Lieberman, with an even kämpferischeren group.</seg>
<seg id="32">Nanny why these scheming Palestinians and leave them in a state of their own?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you really are in control of the West Bank, they are not exactly like their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip, including firing missiles?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in chess and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will be able to carry the day. But the Arab Spring could make them.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists who now in Egypt and in other countries in the seat of power, there is little left for Israel, they will focus initially on the difficulties in their own country.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defense budget is larger than that of Israel's four Arab neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="38">A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab governments little in the overhaul of its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama, working together to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis should think long-term.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians will continue to be stripped of their right to self-determination - a powder keg waiting to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week, a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.</seg>
<seg id="42">Now the oppression undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation is only going to get worse.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a nudge from foreign</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The right answer is represented by the more representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two states, Israel is for security purposes.</seg>
<seg id="46">The - for the near future small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders granted more influence on the enforcement of this solution.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt must stop now, along with Turkey and Qatar, the arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Obama also must play its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term he missed the presentation of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also reluctant to participate in it.</seg>
<seg id="53">But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">And a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australian laws for single cigarette packaging come into force</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia to be replaced by neutral brand logos and colors, dark green lids, which are also printed with graphic images that sick body parts and cigarette smoke ill infants and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Apart from the various health warnings and images from next Saturday, is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are identical, printed in small letters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Australia, the world's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by the glamorous image of smoking will be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not yet started with 26, to smoke, with 99% disabled likely will start after that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"You can already see in children younger age, try to understand the message to the tobacco companies with their brand image," Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies that showed, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and only slightly on the profits of multinational corporations, the changes will affect other countries are considering similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.</seg>
<seg id="11">So it was with the laws would benefit the black market trade, leading to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia says.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra hectares of zico, import Pty Ltd., a small family businesses, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone lids have risen to cover the unbearable packaging, since the companies, British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Supreme Court, with its challenge to the Australian laws.</seg>
<seg id="16">Zico up to 6,000 units have been sold to wholesalers and wait for new stocks.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, this is a good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The snag is that, according to experts in the popularity of social media at precisely the population, the plan goes.</seg>
<seg id="19">A number of Australian law has banned tobacco companies from the TV ads, it forbids them to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to interpret cigarettes in shops. Now the tobacco advertising is changed in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but it has no influence on international sites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Anyone who sells tobacco and only a small section has been to promote its products, is not on the Internet," said Becky Freeman, a researcher at health care at the University of Sydney says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman noted a rise in doswiadczenie reports about brands, which were submitted by "ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="23">The question must be asked: is this just a private person who is so big favour of Marlboro cigarettes, even to the extent that it takes up a video - or has a marketing agency to do so?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead of focusing on marketing to grapple with the new laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization on unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries has increased trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country to 2001 before wrote photographic warnings.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tougher laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many Australian smokers defiantly show.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pictures do not affect me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I ignore them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It takes just a hole and put the box," says Victor Destacó hage when buying a pack of cigarettes, a photo is printed with a mouth tumour.</seg>
<seg id="35">Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the pack" in the city of Sydney, says the uniform packaging have hampered the filling its shelves.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I need to sort an hour to a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The government should simply ban cigarettes entirely - then we would have told us, that's okay, we are close," he added, visibly angry.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is a good time to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I will not lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Wait a half day at the airport on a flight, is quite nervtötend - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">When it comes to you, it is for us, and our children - is okay, occasionally to be bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">So that the brain is forced into interesting thoughts to lose, which promotes the creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because most of us today, almost always on the screen, giving us the benefits of boredom, not more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We should welcome the boredom with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">This brings me back again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Like many people, I am always assumed that that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which develops with increasing leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "boredom: a Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it that way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Indeed, the boredom, a very long history," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">The house walls pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti on boredom, which goes back to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is the question of how we define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is defined in many ways and discussed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that to boredom, as the experience, "a satisfying work, but it will not be able to define themselves."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person is not concerned, but this is going to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">The apathy, on the other hand, there is no rush to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disruption of attention process, coupled with a bad temper and a sense that time passes slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can listen to almost as such as depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be seen in the context of bored people the problem in the environment or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we believe that is boring, even if we just have to concentrate on.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their study, "The unengaged Mind: defining boredom in terms of attention" to "the idle minds: the definition of boredom, from the point of view of the attention," which was published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard a loud television program from the neighboring area, this has nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group heard this noise at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for them and signed their difficulties of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom, Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">However, if you put a monotonous activities, "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help to do not feel bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom can fight, even by people remain physically more closely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Studies have shown that children who must herumhampeln learn more and more information for those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We all will eventually dull - my pretenii dröhnender flight, according to the spokesman, a particularly ermüdender film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people get bored more easily than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">To measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980s to a "vulnerability" scale of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On the scale are statements such as "many things that I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But, in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter clusters.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development conducted at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32 percent of adolescents were bored in school and do the homework, while 23 percent said they would be bored if they were not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">But only 3% of the parents gave in to feel bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.</seg>
<seg id="44">He was sure, however, that "the youth perceived as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers should not have a big impact on their daily lives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question: boredom is healthy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people take extreme physical risks and the gambling or drug addicted to relieve you - the studies have shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and writers examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Vodanovich, professor of the issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"With the boredom, the brain will tell you that you should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of as New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain do not know what you do best.</seg>
<seg id="50">If one is boring and you this energy used to cook and play guitar, we will be happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">But television can ensure happiness for the short-term, but in the long term this evaporate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">A bored child who is an iPad, enough so that it can distract from the boredom. It has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, Professor Fenske says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."</seg>
<seg id="54">The child learns not only to talk, but also in other areas more self-control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not believe that we should be celebrating boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">We should also see them not to be critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead, our aim should be to us too far away from the constant activity and Technologieberieselung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"It sounds as if we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">He believes that the people of truth just look for a way to unwind and relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we are constantly stimulated, it is difficult to deal with, even if the noise is silent."</seg>

<seg id="1">In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime to justice in this country will soon be legal: the possession of a few chunks of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">According to Orozco, he and some friends on a September day with the car in Lamar, near the border with Kansas on the road when they were halted.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police found marijuana in the car, was summoned Orozco for possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien - excusable peccadilloes, which are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and received a court date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is also a?</seg>
<seg id="7">Maybe in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drug offenses, less by the law than from the site.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of regulations that are related to marijuana, and dropped in the state of Washington, which has already approved similar measures.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police authorities are adults over 21 years for possession of a small crowd. This is legally permitted, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced plans to follow the existing marijuana offenses, and people are still quoting court.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains in order to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores opening in their communities.</seg>

<seg id="13">And regulators in the state of Washington to contemplate scratching their heads.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until December 1, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado in any case is ahead of most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for private consumption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market, the state is therefore good for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Authority says for spirits in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Smith admits that no place or system can do more to serve as a rough guide.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, the so-called I-502 enters into force on December 6, and thus represents the end point of a grey area, in which the state licensing system exists yet, but legalized the possession.</seg>
<seg id="20">And unpleasant practice issues must be resolved in this time around, as the government target of a "reasonable access" to which resulted in inserting beeps into marijuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It will be harder nirgendwo, a site for a licensed cannabis business to find than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On November 21, Chief oates sent his employees in Aurora, an e-mail, he said, the prosecutor would pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21 years longer, and that the police "immediately" will seek no prosecutions for these crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief oates added that the police will continue to implement städtische targets for the regulation of medical marijuana growers and drug traffickers would continue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County in northern Colorado district prosecutor Ken Buck takes a tougher view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he has said that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently, 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana brought before the court, although many were prosecuted for other crimes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our agency has the duty to pursue violations, which were at the time for crimes," Buck said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the country, shows adults for the possession of small quantities of any longer.</seg>
<seg id="30">District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided, however, not all outstanding Possess procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not believe that I'm wasting my time in order to enforce the law until it is changing," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was already clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the contradictory reactions throughout the state fostered a deep split among local officials in relation to the big, green experiment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">District prosecutors ajaru when there is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents for marijuana offences in court, the defendants and acts as a spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They have spent a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for criminal prosecution, that you can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first states, such as alcohol, the small quantities of marijuana to treat, Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While advocates and state officials to prepare for the sale of legal age, you can also wait nervously on instructions from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level and continue to treat as a criminal offence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of legalization movement in the hope that the Justice Department is going to give.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several spectacular carcinogenic arrests of the consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government allows the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states, for the most part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik advisor to the Obama administration believes that investigators will probably no doors to seize smaller quantities of drugs, however, are likely to suffer under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several cities in Colorado are not only that the federal authorities to act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratorium on new marijuana shops, although this could open only in about a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week decided Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban is likely to be approved next week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We do not want to be in a position where we license someone and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community has voted against this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="46">We have done, for what the community and not according to what the government has decided.</seg>
<seg id="47">Still, many questions remain open.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford, because I am Tory</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only for university students from being attacked for their views.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once for the stamp of the world's largest, for a modern Greek symposium, which encouraged the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But within two weeks after I entered the Worscester College in the late 1980s - there I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought back as the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father broke down in tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard said it, I would have gone, because I had a problem that students in neighbouring rooms had sex.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author of A N Wilson said schelmisch, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the truth was less amusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">They had harassed me for one reason only - one reason seemed in this alleged cradle of enlightenment so parochial and cruel: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and I advocate in the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why am I saying this now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to recent reports, now suffers from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecutions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The organized and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford has gained such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection, who is gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College, you will be on the basis of their political views, "actively often isolated, attacked personally and declared undesirable."</seg>
<seg id="19">They want to ensure a place in the equality committee of college, so that their views can be expressed freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent broadcasting documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">It shows an alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association at the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce was, among other things, and with silver suit and silver occupied protzte walking stick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities conservative students say that they are seen as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."</seg>
<seg id="23">The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association at the University of Nottingham said in a Sunday newspaper: "there is a growing trend left at universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">People believe that we are like the Bullingdon club, without ever got to have. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">, Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford says, they have watched at JRC members a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and the welfare of the members," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was in a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">As incredibly shy 18-year-olds I arrived in September 1986.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the university voted to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education no honorary title.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the week, in the current new students get to know each other and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.</seg>
<seg id="33">I made the experience that the tutors tolerated the mockery of Tory students not only, but even with friends attended it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the premises of holzgetäfelten Tutoriums.</seg>
<seg id="35">In my first of these events I should translate French texts from the 18th century English. On what it should have been, I was not taken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"," Miss Wyatt said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), please, "the first paragraph."</seg>
<seg id="37">I stumbled.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt was a small man with a face as pie dough, and quite invidious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Refuse Thatcher followers to learn French, or they are just stupid?," he asked me.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students kicherten.</seg>
<seg id="41">Tears in my eyes on wallten.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that you do in your spare time, a few French hours - in other words, if you're not preoccupied with their social activities are," Pitt to gave me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned with hängendem head in my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">This evening, I sat in the College alone at the dinner, as I typed on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it is what it is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone who is suspected to be Tory harassed.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most Tory first semester, pretending to be supporters of the Labour Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In a local pub I later tried to distract me.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I may not always agree with Mrs. Thatcher.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="54">A student in philosophy, politics and economics, the irony is that as a conservative force had attended Eton College, said to me: 'you're the daughter of a fascist pig. "</seg>
<seg id="55">You are polluted.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students shared his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverse and dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"As the Tories have sex?" One asked me.</seg>
<seg id="59">The blow each other, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt so, such as homosexuals from the more liberal legislation in the United States had to have felt like.</seg>
<seg id="61">I would ever be able to lead at the University of Oxford a normal life?</seg>
<seg id="62">I would meet with like-minded people can only after nightfall?</seg>
<seg id="63">I should turn to the Labour Party and the need to express my natural inclinations?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years that were extended in front of me before my eyes to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only tutor who was open to identify themselves as Tory, Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, based in my college.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not only was he hated to be a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy speeches and write for you.</seg>
<seg id="67">He was rarely there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place, it was narrow and parochial and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic-fascist history perspective.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You will not be happy," he told me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of speed-dating evenings flirting (fast).</seg>
<seg id="13">It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily lead to success.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This is not an easy issue, the Government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every year there are 1,300 US dollars for political measures to encourage people to have more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A package of government for married couples and parents grants of up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="19">But everything has so far had little success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in south-east Asia, is also on the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">According to its national population authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time this rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">So why not get the SWF's, Singapore's more children?</seg>
<seg id="24">, Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of the national population authority says that this was due to a "better training" and "greater career opportunities."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This has allowed people to marry and to form a family to have a lot more options in terms of lives and to set priorities," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in the social realities have to the higher number of people living alone and the delay in the marriage and birth control, which resulted in the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, led an immigration policy that aims to counter a surge in immigration, to reduce the population to resentment in the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the little laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese, which have been criticised for keeping wages low and integrate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher fees and charges for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">While the falling birth rate, the well-known effects on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the health-care costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also showed unexpected consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The government is trying to achieve that many small apartments are being built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">So does have an impact on the housing market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and built in certain areas of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the concern is that they can support the lifestyle of the people living alone, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large housing for families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">However, Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company Destacó Developers says that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger units.</seg>
<seg id="40">This means that they are for our cash flow much better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">He admits, however, that the new standards would give developers clearer guidelines, which had previously been placed obstacles in the way, if you build too many small units in a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Even if the new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate, is in talks with the Singapurern who work in the financial district, that it will not have a major impact.</seg>

<seg id="47">"It is important for me to have my own money and time," another, about 20-year-old man says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women have their career, the stress and the cost of the property and education as the reasons for this is that you cannot have children.</seg>

<seg id="41">"The Internet as a medium for the search for information; with the release of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Porras explained that the academics, Marc Prensky, title holder of a master's degree in education at Yale University and author of "digital natives and immigrants" shaped these concepts to explain the phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="43">The digital natives, children and young people, who have grown up with this technology.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We are the digital immigrants, who they are, where we are still learning," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">He said that it is a complex issue, "because we are asking of you that you have a defined criteria, what may be published or distributed, said, in an age where the Ripeness is not sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="46">"They should also be fussy, if you think it is the most important thing is to be loved to have thousands of friends, without the consequences," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and adolescents, which is privacy, to ask you questions, which will lead you to think.</seg>
<seg id="48">"You to say you should not do it, does not work," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Then called porras some possibilities: there are things that you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet?</seg>
<seg id="50">Or: would you, if we published a photo of you, as you published by a friend?</seg>
<seg id="51">You know what the other PUBLISH about you?</seg>
<seg id="52">You have the other people asked for permission in advance, if you carry photos of celebrations?</seg>
<seg id="53">And one more question: should all know what you're doing at any moment?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are the same rules.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Someone outside of the Internet, with respect, decency and other principles, and the same should apply for the social networks," he explains.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the malicious intent and the lie that refute the freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press is not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists, the pursuit of profit and blackmail," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador not more of these journalists, "and dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and skewers bourgeois countries," and that he was in a re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism must "stay firm and will not give any opportunism and clad coup must be legal," because the legitimacy of democracy was "destroyed in Paraguay."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The President of the Republic of Ecuador is also keeping the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the bevorteilte maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua's maritime legal boundaries between the two countries to negotiate, for "absolutely right."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">At present this judgment is not implemented.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between the South and Central American state.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.</seg>
<seg id="29">They need to be treated, so that it can be overcome and look forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He also relied on a successful conclusion of the disputes over the maritime boundary between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, to achieve his third term in order, he stated that he sees this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa said that if he would lose the election in February 2013, out of political life, he would withdraw.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances, such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement had the faith that I was there, guaranteed the probable victory, so I'll have this responsibility," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If I win, it would be my last term as President, then me withdraw from public life.</seg>
<seg id="36">This also applies if we lose.</seg>
<seg id="37">"This is crucial," he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I have just spoken with the vice-president, Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, "he told me that he traveled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could travel to the election campaign back to Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="40">"It does not necessarily mean a return to the health of President Chavez," he commented.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The cause of a dying of AIDS today is a belated recognition</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old, confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if a bomb hit," he says of the moment that he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."</seg>
<seg id="4">He hid it in front of his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to care only about his illness and started to inform themselves; and this with such dedication that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which is difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, a few treatment options and more stigmata.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then it became the director of a clinic of imss to adopt, "because it led to a dead end."</seg>
<seg id="9">At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is now possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now, however, many people are still in the hospital, unaware of their disease and where the virus has already caused damage and your immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, after the first reported cases, "the big success today means that the survival of patients to take the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," the head of the HIV unit of the hCG, jaime Andrade Villanueva said, although he said that this information was based in April this year from a reputable scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">, an expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists inferred since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depends on the extent of the damage to the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that those who do not have a greater chance that drugs are: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a census of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, mean that anyone above the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in this sense, "easily 75 years old can, as long as it is under control," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to view this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today amounts to an average of 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 reduced in 2011 (annual report of onusida)), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the national database collected since the release of the patients have died of AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the month of May this year are already in 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there are since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">So, why people are still dying?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">I think the problem is not the access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the past 12 years, we had no problems with the supply of medicines. The problem is that people come in far advanced state, because they know their infection status, which is not in the late stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He makes a compelling statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have a lifelong infection to be able to deal with the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are SUBCONTRACTOR influence, which is why all those people where it is needed, massive screening tests must be offered."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de ciudades más caras del sida en Jalisco (Coesida) to vote (the State Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio, who has carried out its test at a private laboratory, and this for the simple reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS phase and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and want to hear nothing.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I have to die, then three times better place," they say in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was to improve Appui ernähre me well, I do, and I take the medication.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I am working, I have a lot of responsibility, but an active sex life, I'm on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio lists, which agreed to share his intimate details with Milenio Jalisco to encourage those who, with his testimony today in the context of the world AIDS day fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">They should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group. The sooner you know whether you are HIV-positive, the better, and if you know the diagnosis, they have to learn how to live as all the people responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Between the health programs and the ordinary citizens large holes, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara that the cause of HIV has adopted.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the most important thing is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">On this particular places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased Wénjn; they were made separately, now you are giving us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of new infections among young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"What you need the widespread derision?" Is a question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people want to get out, the correspondent said.</seg>
<seg id="39">He proposed to orient these inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of institutions that are frequented by young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">It should not be promoted promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">It should not be the beer and motel paid, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms should be distributed under his administration.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Sexuality is not; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity exercise," he brought it to the point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key data from Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There's 13.435 cumulative cases (1.317 12.158 AIDS and HIV).</seg>

<p>
<seg id="45">The state is in fourth place nationally and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of the infection cases of sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2% Perinatal.</seg>

<seg id="2">You could say that the procedures to ensure the survival of the company, to allow Mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes in contradiction to international agreements have no validity.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote could have gone 45 percent against 37 percent.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">The most serious in this case is that the court set aside a document, which was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), where the in vitro procedure is described in the framework of the law on trade bankruptcies, and pointed out that it will adhere strictly to the agreements signed by the two countries had to respond to the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law in the United States.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"My life I have put me in the basketball many hats, even several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora near his home in Bayamón Isabel, where he lived with his faithful wife for more than 50 years, lives.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes exaggerates with this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house, almost all are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the heart of Bayamón</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The most emotional recollections are those who remember his time at the vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player in 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or managers of the clubs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"That was my best years that I most enjoyed, because I had the opportunity to be part of the vaqueros eight championships since 1967 it as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were many fulfilling years, including five championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy at BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I know that genes Bartow, who worked as a trainer and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), I was hired, said: "I have a very strong and 2-foot-tall players.</seg>
<seg id="16">You want it? "</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow law.The recommended the free throw specialists Raymond Gausse, who is a citizen and one of our best shooter was.</seg>
<seg id="19">I know how he said that if Mincy allows a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another would provide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship of the vaqueros with Gausse was granted, but from a distance, because he was already in 1988 at the top of the Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the time, he prefers to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when we won for the first time in the upcoming tournament in Mexico against the United States.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the World Cup in 1990, when we occupied the fourth place, what should have been a bronze, if not this Canadian referee would have been the repeated the last game for the second time, said Pienaca Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This group of the World Cup in 1990 was the best national team you've ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is one of the best in the world, as well as those who won the Olympic Games 2004 against the Dream Team.</seg>
<seg id="26">My favorite, however, is the team of the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won the team gold and the US offered a fight, as when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in 1990 because of a knee injury.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team that perhaps in terms of personality was not the best, but we won a gold medal and gave us great joy, was that of the upcoming tournament in 1995), Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata against all predictions, we won the gold medal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player from Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this, without taking account of his career in different leagues, in which he has played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of the young, the work of Leo Arill suits me well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN included at the beginning of the 1990s until 17 teams in one season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What remains to be done to you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes.</seg>
<seg id="43">The guys in Ponce, for example, play only in their area, and only in the Polo Grounds on national teams from other corners of the island.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today, the children of many unnecessary travel and games.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, referees and officials contracts.</seg>
<seg id="46">I am proud of that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are you doing today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I like to listen to music, see my time in music videos from YouTube, Otherwhise my grandchildren and from time to time I go to a basketball game.</seg>
