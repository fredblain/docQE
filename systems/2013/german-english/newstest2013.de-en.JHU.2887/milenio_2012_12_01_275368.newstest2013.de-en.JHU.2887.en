"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, where "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, of the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) participated, which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "in the Second World War and other conflicts umbrachten" and "are practically a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, the Member States of the UNASUR forward.
"the free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; there are still, however, reactionary sectors, seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President also advocated Ecuador the redesign of the Organisation of American States (oea) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on human rights.
The lessons, undertake never to something, and in return we sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted the Ecuador.
Correa said that he does not regret this decision, because he was so as not to betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights" has fulfilled.
He added that it was "reasonable suspicions have given that Assange be delivered to a third country and procedures would not observed."
He also criticised the Swedish prosecutors have demanded of him, to give him an interrogation on its territory because of alleged sexualdelikts, while "the Swedish legislation allows this via a video conference, which could have been carried out on the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental state of Assange would be compromised.
"since he is in our message is, I have not spoken to him, the Ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the head of state in Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he take physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a narrow space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors.
"that would affect the health of every people," he added.
Correa was that the solution to the asylum, which was granted Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London since the month of June, the granting of a freibriefs is, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that Europe's lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities. He stressed that there had been talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, we are this word in this case not to, there have been constant discussions, however.
"the solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, baltazar Garzón, a number of procedures at various European bodies leads," he said.
And "if Britain this licence granted tomorrow, I believe that this is done."
And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or Skype verhörte, as it allows the Swedish law and was made in other cases, the problem is finished.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he can tolerate," the mediocrity, not the evil intention and dispel the lie, the freedom of expression."
"the greatest enemies of freedom of the press is not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In that sense it beglückwünschte that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists', and not by the bankers or hegemonischen and spießbürgerlichen countries," and took vorweg that he is in a re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the UNASUR at least up to the next elections, and he argued that the body "must be hard and not opportunism and not as legal verkleideten coup stattgeben darf," because it "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of Ecuador is also keeping the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the verdict of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua bevorteilte to negotiate with Nicaragua seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, for "absolutely right."
Currently this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.
They must be fully treated so that they can overcome and look to the future.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America, international bodies to call if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."
In relation to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he gave that he sees this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very hard."
Correa assured that, if he losing the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from the political life.
power has never interested me personally, but under unjust circumstances such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was there, the likely victory guaranteed, so I must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I draw me from public life back.
This also applies, if we lose.
"It is decided," he said.
Correa also took to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba relation.
I have just spoken with the Vice-President of Venezuela, nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he planned for a routine treatment would have travelled there, and that is that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
"It is in any case a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader took part today in Lima on the 6th summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to provide for a sustainable progress, equality, and security.
