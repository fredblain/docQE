In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marihuanagesetz
The 19-jährige Community college-student footballer Anthony orozco atbilstošs sdosten colorados for a crime in court, which will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few marihuanabrocken and a pipe that they smoked.
According to orozco, he and some friends on a septembertag travelling by car in lamar near the Kansas border, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, was orozco for the possession of drugs and drogenutensilien vorgeladen - kavaliersdelikte, which are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and received a gerichtstermin.
"We are treated like criminals," so orozco.
But he is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drogendelikte less from the law, as the location.
Hundreds of offences that will turn to marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, the approved similar measures, already dropped.
The police no longer pursue adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally allowed, as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts colorados have announced that existing marihuanadelikte weiterzuverfolgen quote and people are still in court.
At the same time are voting on it several cities, from the suburbs denvers to the western mountains, new, state licensed marihuanageschäfte to stop at the opening in their communities.
"this situation is evolving so rapidly, that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. oates, chief of police in aurora, which lies east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington State kratzen perplexed at the head.
They are waiting for a guide on the establishment of a lizenzsystems for production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and we have a deadline until 1 December 2013 in mind.
In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado is ahead in any case, most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. There was only the drug for medical purposes and then the eigenkonsum legalised.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for guidance," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide to serve.
"We have no real precedent, which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called i-502, enters into force on 6 December and this is also the conclusion of a grey area, in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalised.
And unpleasant praxisfragen must be resolved in this time - for example, how the government target of a "fair access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres to schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.
"No, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the conurbation of Seattle," says Ben livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, chief oates sent his staff in aurora, an e-mail in which he said that the Public Prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marihuanadelikte in people over 21 years, and that the police will pursue "immediately" no strafanzeigen for these offences.
Chief oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban vorgaben to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue to pursue.
In weld county in the north colorados represents bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he gave to his authority would continue to monitor cases of marihuanabesitz, mainly to persuade consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people prosecuted for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many were also charged for other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to pursue violations, which are the tatzeitpunkt were crimes," ließ buck said in a statement.
reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa county, where voters rejected the marihuana-initiative ambivalent.
The police in grand junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults for the possession of small quantities no longer.
bezirksstaatsanwalt pete hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided to not all outstanding besitzverfahren to drop.
"I do not believe that I don't waste my time on this, to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, has been clear from the start that it would not be easy to arrange the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the State encouraged among local officials a profound dichotomy in terms of the big green experiment to days.
In bezirksstaatsanwälten if it was a "cultural barrier," said Sean mcallister, a lawyer from Denver for marihuanadelikte stehende defendants in court, and on the ground as a spokesperson for the National Organization for the reform of marihuanagesetzen operates.
"You have such a big part of their lives to prosecute people for that they spent the legalisierung still cannot accept," he believes.
The first states that treat small quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington as a national musterfälle acted for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sale, at the same time, nervous wait for instructions from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to treat as a crime.
Advocates of the legalisierungsbewegung hope that the justice department will give in.
Despite several aufsehenerregender defends arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States largely gestattet.
Kevin A. sabet, former drogenpolitik-berater the Obama administration believes that kriminalbeamte is likely to be no doors of small quantities of the drugs, but probably reluctant to seize the legal under the new legislation, staatlich regulated marihuana-geschäfte to tolerate.
several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities act.
Even before the election day genehmigten some local administrators moratoriums on new marihuana-geschäfte, although this could open only in about a year.
Last week, montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position in which we license and then someone at the federal level are facing a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a Member of the town council.
Our Community has voted against this change.
We are then, for what the Community has decided and not after, for which the state has decided.
There are still many questions.
