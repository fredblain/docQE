The future Constitution with the sharia as the basis has been highly controversial.
The Egyptian President division not with pathos.
We must create the transition.
"and that he will succeed is my responsibility, from the people and from God," he said on state television service.
His speech was directed to all the people, but especially well to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.

Mohammed mursi said, he had almost entschuldigend, the competences of the constitutional court temporarily curtailed and extended its powers," in order to save the revolution."
But what the American 61-jährige engineer, a doctorate of the University of southern California is really wants to save, are the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear about this.
Should the judiciary be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles, which the Islamist dominated 100-köpfigen Constituent Assembly because in a nightly, 15-stündigen parforceritt were being pushed through some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also says in the draft, the rechtsprechung reasons on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
It was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will exploit the vague wording and the attendant legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least one new hinzugeführter article: in all issues relating to Sharia law should the al-ashar-universität zurate be drawn, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in the entire Sunni Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which would result in de facto the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much in the verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military should continue to be maintained.
These courts dienten during Mubarak's rule to repression of opposition.
After the fall of the dictator were up to 11,000 civilians in militärhaft.

This is legally as vague wording that state institutions with the help of this Article might even control the content of film and literature.
In klartext means nothing other than censorship.
No Article übrigens lays down ausdrücklich equality between men and women.

But what an insult is and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
As dubious is the wording of the "insult to the people" is banned.
Is there has been a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of jurists?
open to interpretation, as much in the draft, the mursi to sign before and after his words "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented for referendum.
"The revolution is returned"
The opposition is becoming organised for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual agreement on Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to topple the Charter, before they can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said hamdin sabbahi drittplatzierter of the presidential elections.

"If he exclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it," said the opposition jasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet gesühnt," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not be to want to monitor, making it void.
"the Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew ihrerseits to gegendemonstration, cautiously but not in Tahrir Square, but after a massengebet on the other bank of the Cairo University.

They demanded by mursi: "A cleanse the country!" and beteuerten: "the Koran is our Constitution."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably bürgerkriegsähnliche zustände heraufbeschworen.
The mursis anhänger clearly did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood do declared, both the opponents of verfassungsentwurfes and the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights, not even before"
Hafez Abu saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, who until February and all social forces einbinden should have gone.
The 48-jährige human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian organization for human rights (eohr) defended the Muslim Brotherhood do, when they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.

For this he was convicted, imprisoned, beaten.
"and now is the word 'human rights not even in the new Constitution," he complained in conversation with the "world on Sunday."
mursi machtausweitung on all three powers in the state because the lawyer resignieren.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"rather than strengthening civil society, you have the President de facto aside," laments saeda.
But without civil society organisations a democracy cannot work.
saeda feels alone, even by the international community, the ideological richtungskampf along the Nile regarded with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could be revenge.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warns: "Your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."
