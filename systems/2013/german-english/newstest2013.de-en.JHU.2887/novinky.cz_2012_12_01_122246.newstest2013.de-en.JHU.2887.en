Guidelines for the bloat of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, every year a survey on the absurdesten bankgebühren exclaims, has decided to hold the contest "most absurd regulation or idea from the eu-werkstatt" this year.
"On this idea brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of major European companies," said Patrik nacher to care about the organisation of this survey, the newspaper právo.
Among the nominees absurditäten is located, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of versicherungstarife for men and women.
Until then genossen women in life insurance an advantage, because they are objectively less risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible attacks from the eu-werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year.
The real vote will occur by the end of February 2013," said then.
controversial regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol fuel, which in its result naturschädigend, furthermore, the prohibition of reliable quecksilberthermometer just because this is a relatively small amount of this gefahrenstoffes enthalten, or even the directive to the size of hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism has in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butteraufstrich" or the marketing of conventional light bulbs.
bananas must be 14 inches long
The eu-apparat entscheidet often under pressure from this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented by one or more Member States in Brussels (for example, currently trying the Czech Republic, also with veto-drohung demands Czech banks impose).
lobby-interessen were also discovered that the highest handelsklasse bananas in the EU must be at least 14 inches long and should not have "krümmungsanomalie".
The European Commission defended themselves with the argument that it only the fragmented national standards harmonisiere that would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries already with the note that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons in the sale must be provided with the note that children under eight years the balloon not without the supervision of an adult can inflate.
The EU stood in an American study, according to balloons are the leading cause of the death by asphyxiation of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of jahrmarktströten.
Curious einfälle there is also home
relatively absurd is also a directive, which European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU, because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece must not use the name Macedonia and must instead say Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
The server bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez faire in addition to the above absurdities, the EU regulation on the scale of lebensmittelvorräten on the territory of a Member State.
The EU laid the höchstvolumen lebensmittelvorräten found that, on the day of our membership of the EU in the area of the Czech Republic are durfte.
The Czech Republic überschritt then threatened for the volume for pilzkonserven, for which we have established a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them, but that they have no sea, or by the idea, to provide funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were, however, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by this, that we have no sea.
We in the EU will refund request," said in the autumn of 2004 the then agriculture minister Jaroslav palas (čssd).
As an argument, he led to the getreideernte was very high and the state as a result of the so-called interventionseinkäufe überfüllt camp were.
Because the Czech Republic have another way to sea ports, the EU should согласно palas hundreds of millions of euros to us figures.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far in that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding offered the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of the Communities Minister Pavel němec (us-deu), specifically, it has to be the funding for the establishment of fördergeldanträgen act to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
regulations in the Member States are easy to target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also for effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserves according to some experts, however, more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to the experts are more the eu-fördergelder for projects, which together with the deepening of European integration have nothing, but when the budget negotiations were imposed by individual Member States.
Emotions calls in the fact that the Czech Republic similar to other Member States in Brussels must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "olomoucké tvarůžky" to defend the inländerrum (tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename "tuzemák."
The name 1300-talshus may only be used for products from zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, in the company of the world-famous cheese, feta and gorgonzola, the lübecker marzipans or the parmaschinkens now the Karlsbader biscuits, carp from pohořelice and třeboň, or even the saazer hops.
With a eu-marke can as the pardubicer gingerbread or the hořicer serpentini breasts.
