petronella Wyatt: I was in Oxford to, because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
been it has always been my biggest dream, to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the University, which I once considered the world's largest wissenstempel, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance - promoted.
But within two weeks after my arrival in worscester college - there in the late 1980s, I had intended to study history - I had my suitcase and found as the first scandal of my life again.
My father broke out in tears.
My friends were confused.
The evening standard said it, I would be gone, because I would have had a problem with that fellow students in neighbouring rooms had sex.
The author a n Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged Cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
. I ran
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been harassed for one reason only - a reason, in this alleged birthplace of enlightenment so blinkered and cruel seemed now: my late father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and I have been in favour of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports, is a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and increasing hatred of tory-studenten in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week the same gleichberechtigungsschutz forderte, benefits the schwulen, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative Members of the corpus Christi college junior common room (JCR) indicate that they are because of their political views "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable."
They call for a place in the gleichberechtigungskomitee your college, in order to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
The situation was exacerbated by a recent ausgestrahlte documentation on political students on BBC two," Wonderland: young, bright and on the right," was the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It was shown, among other things, absolvent Joe cooke, a former President of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, in a Rolls-Royce and rode with silver suit and silberbesetztem gehstock protzte.
at other universities say conservative students, they are regarded as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old luke black, Vice-President of the conservative studentenvereinigung of the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper said: "there is a growing linkstendenz at universities.
The people believe that we are like the bullingdon club, without us even kennengelernt."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and geschichtsstudent in corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the view that such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-jährige stephanie cherill, president designate of the conservative student association of Oxford says she observed in jcr-mitgliedern a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of Members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was such a minority.
arrived as unbelievably timid 18-jährige I was in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year the university had voted in favour, Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education to give no title.
The atmosphere would have even stalinisten aufschrecken.
In the first days of the erstsemester-woche, in the new students and tutors kennelernen, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors the mockery of tory-studenten not only duldeten, but even with pleasure take part.
political issues such as bergarbeiterstreik, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa had found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutoriums.
In my first of these events should translate into English. I French texts from the 18th century to what then should have been taken, I was not.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face as from kuchenteig, and quite gehässig.
"refuse thatcher-anhänger, to learn French, or are you just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
wallten tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few französischstunden in their leisure time - so, if you are not too busy with their social activities," knurrte me Pitt.
I returned with hängendem head back in my room.
On this evening, I sat alone at dinner, as I have been easy on the shoulder tippte in college.
It was a englischstudent from the second year called James, who is a member of the Conservative student Association presented.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is harassed.
For me it is bad enough, but you know that your father Margaret Thatcher nahesteht, so it will be worse for you.
Most tory-erstsemester pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I tried later to adjust me.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs. Thatcher was in all respects.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A new entrant in the field as Conservative philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, the current Eton College had visited, said to me: "You're the daughter of a faschistenschweins."
polluted you.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"As Tories have sex?" asked me one.
The beat each other, right?
I felt as homosexuals in the more liberal legislation of the United States felt had to have.
Would I ever be able, at the University of Oxford to lead a normal life?
I would talk only after nightfall can make?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclinations to suppress?
The three years that lay before me, began before my inner eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who openly admitted as a Tory, was Norman stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
He was not only for this to be a conservative, but also because he hated Thatcher in terms of foreign policy advice and had written for you talk.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found him parochial and kleinkariert and rejected him for his marxistisch-deterministische geschichtsperspektive.
In 1997, he took a professorship at the University of bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I started to commute between Oxford and the House my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I Oxford hated, and why I did it.
He seemed disbelief.
accepted during his time in the vierzigern were all political views.
"but it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
So, not something they would never do in my city of träumenden spire.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners on the day.
His moist eyes trübten.
Give the whole a chance.
I am sure you neckt you only.
It would break my heart, if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also tory-anhänger, had buckled under pressure and his convictions entsagt.
During a tutoriums in the following week, in which another geschichtstutor seriously had said that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I was that my parents were subjected to "brainwashing" and called them "old idiot."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, the final nail in the coffin of my oxford-karriere schlug.
At the time he wrote two columns in the murdoch-presse per week.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my häscher on.
As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can like a weinerlichen schlappschwanz nennen.
But no 18-jährige should ever in a school under such intimidation and boshaftigkeit must suffer.
And even more tragic is that it was, a University of Oxford, which not only 14 tory-premierminister hervorbrachte, but up to now hiding behind a windfall reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
