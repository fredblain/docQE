With bitcoin pay and sell without bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Furthermore, as so often in these technologies is a political vision greifbar: the belief that the current, of bankmonopolen designed monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, this is of satoshi nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) convertible and a protocol for the secure exchange like bittorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions recorded.
Several thousand webseiten accept bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of bitcoin had reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later, before he has recovered today to around $10 to $2 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive in relation to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies shown interest for this.
It describes bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a video game that you win or play with (and sometimes zurücktauschen) can buy.
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, the trade is controlled by a central authority and each time bearbeitet.
With bitcoin are all netzknoten gleichzeitig repositories of the rechnungsbuchs, auditors, geld-emittenten and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two email addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for every payment, ensuring the anonymity.
A number of the associated with this transaction data will electronically through a double verschlüsselungssystem signed.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded in the entire network widespread rechnungsbuch of public accounts are available.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task which started on the computers, with the winner, which is a kind of preliminary zentralbankier, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a carving up the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add it a number, before the whole "zerhackt."
The goal is to find that number, which is a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning) ergibt.
If this number was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently with the chain of all other transactions verknüpft, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to cheat Two times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other is no link, because both have different fingerprints.
The computer, which has resolved the task, gets 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation this reward will regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but to a hundertmillionstel teilbar, what makes some room for manoeuvre.
In addition, increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement of computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for bitcoin, have been attacked and the bitcoin-einlagen stolen.
"The vulnerability is not the actual minutes used," assured Pierre noizat just paymium has introduced, this is a company with real money for the payment and the network bitcoin uses.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also these shortcomings.
major players such as Wikipedia verweigern donations of this kind.
By others such as the blog-plattform wordpress will accept them.
Recently, ADI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel rechnungsbuch analyses and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-schlussverkauf" started.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon holmquist is pleased, who works for the company coinabul the bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre noizat, is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as transaktionsnetzwerk.
His system paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate the transactions that it is cheaper.
In addition, manages the owner's identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented in the traders, and the latter must no new terminals or install computer programs.
You just need an address, a phone "can be photographed and identified", is Pierre noizat plyuk, assured that he has thousands of users.
There, it is a general trend in the hierarchical systems for more horizontal ausgerichteter systems be reconsidered.
"It will take some time before bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, the various today as a highly respected risks in the event of a success to revalue the currency.
