own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
rosbalt continues the "Petersburg avant-garde" project, dedicated to the urban dwellers, the form the vanguard of art and culture.
On the fine list landeten already senior representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city and often without recognition in Europe, in the rest of Russia to be known.
The new hero of rosbalt is the extravagant knstler kirill Miller.
The whole town knows kirill Miller, dressed in red, the bearded one time at the Russian museum, sometimes in the summer garden, time szene-treffen or encountered at openings.
Wherever the images of kirill Miller also issued, will attract large crowds.
kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg sozial-philosophischen artists, the new myths created.
kirill Miller is a shining personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and puts a smile in the face by his presence on the street his fellow citizens, and to you for good mood.
He recently snapped a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg drehorgelspieler, because he felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his künstlerdasein, his philosophy and his image finally.
- kirill, why are you actually always in red and not for example in yellow and Turquoise in the city on the road?
I chose the color red as fashion designers, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world is red of the compromise between artists, imageberater and society.
In the society calls everything differs somewhat from the graunorm, aggression and bad behaviour.
But let me through my provocations with the people come into the conversation.
any of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- when did you know that you have to be painter?
were issued - at an exhibition in the palace of culture newskij, in my work.
I realised that I must go down this route.
Then there was the time the old free, but not officially recognised painter then to end, and new and free painters such as I was incomprehensible.
I am friendly with the new generation of painters, so with the representatives of the "gazonewschina"; it was "pushkinskaya 10," and then was once end.
It attracts me to theater, to fashion, music, actually to everything except the literature.
- and all the united in your art-klinik... - it was important to me to be at the heart of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovierungsarbeiten a musikalisch-künstlerischen club for the boheme, the House of St. Petersburg boheme.
Many were born there: n.o.m. tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project "ucho van goga" There came.
cast and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight shirts and also the trendy composer Igor wdowin today was one of them.
When the group started to play live, was from it "Leningrad".
trachtenberg moderated many programmes before the time of "halli-galli."
We gave them trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us.
Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "griboedov" have their origin in the art-klinik.
There, our employees and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, as culture still meant something.
In the year 2000 there was a poll in the press, on the award was "personalities of our city."
I won in the category of "artist of the year," and that I was reached at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without making a cultural contribution to make.
- your work have a unique style.
- many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly currentness and sharpness of thought.
I will have an exhibition with the theme of "the Russian museum as clowns."
clowns timeless.
Earlier I was socially, but now it grieveth and bereitet fear, to be so.
In a clown blurs the everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world by we dictate that everyone fully to dress up.
Now, everyone on the clothes and is based on the outer and not on the interior of the people.
But perhaps we cannot provide a person, but it should in the face of spit.
The deception disappears through the verkleiden.
- recently we saw you in the role of urban drehorgelspielers. - a city of culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- can also be commercial art be beautiful?
- today must be commercial art cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of the cultures.
Earlier formed the people large groups: the bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people the other.
Now there are mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not einhundert-dollar-note, everyone likes.
Now you have to consider, whom you'll like.
Now, every kultstar about 100 supporters.
- to the appearances of stas michailow come but several thousand!
- come to him verlassene women, the sexuell-soziale sphere plays a role there.
for cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes on.
I have supporters, and the important thing is not to cheat and that, not to destroy it.
In my youth I have such images painted in a collector even in a number with the works of Falk and larionow hingen.
I started with images, which normally only come at the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture, which I support.
- kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- good kulturexperten.
say: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real Tsar it was different, because the Tsar understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what the experts, but they could be the road is blocked, as it hochrangigerer experts need to properly evaluate the the former and you clear the way.
Now, only their own taste.
The same applies to the erarta, but with the difference that you honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters, therefore, must look for other museums.
Petersburg - what is for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow, there is much more culture and an appropriate breeding ground.
On our stones can art difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural breeding because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people, visit the exhibitions and concerts.
We are the much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants the city st.-petersburg
