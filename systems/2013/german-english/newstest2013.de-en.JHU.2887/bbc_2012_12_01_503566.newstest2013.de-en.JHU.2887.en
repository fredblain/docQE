rakfisk from Norway: is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but around the world.
Could the secret of success of the country have anything to do with the local appetite for fairly übelriechenden fish?
Take a selection überreifer cheeses.
One place you in the middle of a pile of dirty, humid sportswear.
and leave you there a week.
Just about must be the nasenbetäubenden smell of rakfisk vorstellen, one of the great delights of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which simply will not disappear.
rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which - depending on how stinkend its fish would have you believe - up to a year in water fermentiert.
When the darkness in Norway on the country, and the weather is colder, strömen Norwegians to a celebration here in fagernes, this is dedicated to, well, really very impressive specialty.
"you can eat it raw and then into it with a glass of aquavit down," says havard halvarsen, actually in the local feuerwache works, but as a so-called "rakfisk-general" the festival was held.
around us people eat small fischwürfel and take large amounts of alcohol.
"mansche people dislike the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says havard.
The spirituose can replace the smell.
I eat some bites.
If it avoids rakfisk in nasennähe to bring, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride behind it.
rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian epoche, when there was no kühlmöglichkeiten and fish in the autumn in air-tight salzwasserfässern was drenched.
In deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol gedämpften senses - consumed.
Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and traveled mainly in the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a buoyant labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not too long ago was much richer than Norway, strömen immigrants.
rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, if strictly riechender part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud EUR\ xC2 10.
Norway does not often in the world's media, and most people this does not seem to disturb.
Here hasst it still, different Breivik to name - those racist right-wing extremists, the 77 men, women and children, last year.
Instead, it is only to the "incident on 22\ xC2 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in your peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
Norway is primarily responsible for today's wealth since the early 1970's, the growth of the world's largest oil and gasindustrien.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is us so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with reifem rakfisk distributed and with her long blond hair and the pungent blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are, as the saying goes - sensible people.
her English is just like the most people here makellos.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not bragging.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - dealt a large part of the branchenerträge is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years up to the global economic crisis, all with money to throw, it does not owned Norway his wallet firmly closed.
"as long as we can go skiing in the winter and summer hiking, we are happy," says Anna.
"and of course rakfisk eat," adds you with unbeschwertem laugh.
I am in the snow and am for another court - from rakfisk I have enough.
So a elch-burger is in any case something else. The juicy meat mundet me.
But in the evening is again the stinkefisch on the menu.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several locations, which organise a rakfisk-dinner, in which guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging geruchssinne - fish.
There is a live-tv-schaltung with a fly bekleideten showmaster, of plates with rakfisk is surrounded.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your score up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor-jürgen?"
"Here are our points, havard."
You klatscht and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, possibly from the aquavit overwhelmed.
But perhaps it is the strict dunst of whole fish.
