Singapore babies to save the economy needs
The singapurer blame for that you don't have children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the kindererziehung.
"The population of Singapore has to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our bürgerpflicht and make life.
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for minzbonbons, yet - or because of it - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper-songs, the local sayings such as "push is a" Bao "(laib) in the oven, in order to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency bbh, which has shot the video, is the hope that the advertising achieved in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to the people to make their "national duty" meet.
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it a fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue to which we have had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromonen or the organisation of speed-dating-abenden (fast flirting).
possible that many of these ideas were creative, you, but not necessarily to success.
So we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap to compose?
1.2 children
If this issue is not easy, is the Government of Singapore.
Every year it is 1,300 dollars for political measures to encourage the citizens to have more children.
A package of government for married couples and parents granted up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, hochtechnologischer city-state in South-East Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In its national bevölkerungsbehörde, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time, as this rate on 2 fraud - which is also known as ersetzungsrate - was in 1976.
So why not get the singapurer more children?
tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of national bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this was due to a "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has allowed the people, except to marry and to form a family to have far more options in relation to lebensziele and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single and the delay marriage and geburten, whose outcome is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy, aimed at a drastic increase in zuwanderungen to counteract the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites, where the little kaschierte xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese, to be criticised for keeping wages low and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on economic growth of a nation, the tax revenue, the cost of health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.
It has already have an impact on the housing market.
The Agency for urban development has started to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "schuhschachteln" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are an area of 46 square meters and show a great success in terms of sales.
However, there is the concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single, and that they discourage the construction of large apartment for families to build.
But Lim Yew soon, Director-General of the real estate company El developers, says that his "schuhschachteln" much faster than larger apartments sell.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that you are very much better for our cash flow.
He is, however, that the new standards the developers clearer guidelines, which had previously been put obstacles in the way, if you too many small units in a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate is the talks with the singapurern, working in the financial district, to show that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed, the housing and education are expensive, which is why it is delayed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get other.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.
Men and women lead their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that you cannot have children.
That is why the singapurer have the last word, when it comes to have children - because the government can still do so much.
