"protection" in China: if Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese will
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph lauren ebenfalls.
What is Armani Polo?
behind it lies a in China officially registered name, but it has nothing to do with the ursprungsunternehmen.
But it enjoys protection, as long as the actual namensgeber not complaints.
And even then it is not clear whether you get right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas pattloch, lawyer at the law firm Taylor wessing, which specializes in schutzrechtsverletzungen in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The nachahmern rich already a few additional letters, so that they can register their brands.
It will be held from simply lu-gucci Gucci, Prada is prada-kny eintragen.
Also German companies are legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturers PUMA.
pattloch opens a folder with eintragungen of markenamts in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, where a Chinese company the trademark zegna df PUMA to protect a kunstnamen, which is also the fashion company ermenegildo zegna bediente.
That the Chinese world champion in the copy and the injured are intellectual property, is known.
In the big cities there are multistory department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his clients before he goes against that Chinese companies from markenamt officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "bâng mingpai," a beifahrermarke.
The word is based on "bâng dakuan."
that women are meant, the rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"This is geschäftsschädigend, we must combat it," fordert pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the alleinstellung disappears, the imageschaden is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the industries are in the millions, especially in expensive vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the marktforschungsgesellschaft clsa is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But löschungen dubioser entries in markenregister are hard to reach and go to the money.
up to nine years can last for the procedure, with an uncertain outcome.
pattloch reports of cases in which the Court complaints abwies because, after the long duration of beanstandete name to "marktrealität" had become.
If the plaintiff must have bad luck, he even the plagiator pay money, because his brand in China injured, says pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
famous cases concern graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the baumaschinenhersteller sany, the company that recently the German betonpumpenbauer putzmeister übernahm.
resembles the Chinese must therefore until today use of an emblem that the mercedes-stern.
The volvo-käufer geely used originally a blau-weißes logo, the BMW remembered; the dispute was resolved, geely had to change it.
The modehersteller Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile schauen ließen in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
While this markenamt ctmo in Beijing is that there 2010 due to lower personnel and raumausstattung bottlenecks have given.
But last year was one of the "emergency in workflow returned to normal life."
It is the bestand unbearbeiteter einspruchsverfahren dropped by 22 percent.
Almost 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet in the office are still waiting 81.500 objections on erledigung.
tackle costs a lot against
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the ctmo more than 1.4 million applications for protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record for the tenth consecutive year, the list of capabilities around the world lead, and means that China shares with the authority.
That also holds true for the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
2011 were 1.8 billion yuan in fees have been taken.
Simplified, it means that any application on average 1280 yuan or costs 160 euros.
To confront this costs many times, as the case of the German company freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
While the German could achieve that its illegal manufacture imitierter kraftfahrzeugteile ausgehoben was.
But secured the nachahmer continues to the Chinese rights to the brand freudenberg.
We have failed to do this, because in Germany familiennamen could not be protected, says hanno wentzler freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich, chairman of the board of directors.
The markenamt ctmo dismissed the appeal of the Munich because back.
In the next two bodies got freudenberg right, but the prozessgegner still fighting today.
We must höllisch careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
wentzler is confident, to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the process is extremely complex and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could be hardly put the firmenarchiv have even one hundred years old files must review, to provide evidence.
Five years ago, freudenberg the other side in vain a "high sechsstelligen eurobetrag" to resolve.
"This shows you how much we value is," says wentzler.
zurückzuschwappen the dangers in the Far East threaten even to Europe.
That is, if there imitatoren vulnerable brands ensure.
So wanted a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, the name freudenberg for shoes and leather anmelden.
This business has long abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration.
höllisch must be careful," says wentzler."
Both he and the lawyer pattloch raten German companies to be very careful in doing business with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, but if the foreigners "everything is somehow schützenswert anmelden, even in China," as wentzler says.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if freudenberg in the last act of his markendramas unterliege, it would probably be the other side pay royalties for its own name, said wentzler.
Or we will in the segment squeezed out of the market in question.
