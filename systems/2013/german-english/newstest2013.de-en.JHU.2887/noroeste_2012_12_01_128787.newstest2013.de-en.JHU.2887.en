After the Court of Appeal has confirmed the United States a judgment, which does not recognise the group's restructuring of verbindlichkeiten vitro, which was reached on a handelskonkurs in Mexico, there is a more sinister precedent for each national companies with operations in neighbouring countries, the insolvency.
You could say that the procedures for the survival of the company, the Mexican laws allow, in the land of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition of the ruling by the judge handed down on June 15 harlin hale in bancarrotas on court for the northern district in Texas to the Mexican company the seizure of their property on the other side of the river bravo helpless are exposed.
However, the largest glashersteller in Mexico's decision opens the door to call because three inconsistencies the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge thing to point out that the creditors must be subject to bankruptcy law of the United States, says the Court of Appeal of the fifth circuit, based in New Orleans first that it is in the main the handelskonkurs dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures in default by companies with länderübergreifendem profile is not known.
Indeed, for this purpose, the United Nations modellgesetz created for the unification of international trade law, with the American law Institute was used as simple.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the votes of the societies to recognise the liabilities of the bankrupt estate, the branches of vitro with its parent company, did not have the majority required for the restructuring of debt would be accomplished.
However, this possibility of the Mexican laws recognised.
Actually vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including agremex and comercial mexicana, whose obligations under companies of the group from the Instituto federal de concursos mercantiles (Federal Institute for handelskonkurse) confirmed.
It is true also that after deduction of the voices of the branches of vitro, the creditors, the creditors in the courts of the United States against vitro complained, i.e. the geier-fonds such as aurelios capital, aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, a majority had achieved.
assumed the vote would be 45 percent to 37 percent.
This is from the court of appeal not taken into account.
On the other hand, there are vitro blame for his difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the serious economic crisis in the United States, where it blows away.
For this reason, the family González sada before the same berufungsgericht contradiction, so that the vote in plenary erfolgt, i.e. all the judges, because only three of them voted.
The is not granted, the cerciorare-einspruch eingelegt, which calls for a review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious in this case is that the Court a document aside, that was sent by the Government of Mexico under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the Court), what the in vitro procedures carried out within the framework of the law on handelskonkurse described, and what it is pointed out that it had kept strictly to the agreements signed by both countries to meet the konkursgesetzes Chapter 15 of the United States.
It is also pointed out that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, i.e. the established rules for cross-border insolvency cases that guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
zweibandige karambole: a blow for vitro and for the country.
