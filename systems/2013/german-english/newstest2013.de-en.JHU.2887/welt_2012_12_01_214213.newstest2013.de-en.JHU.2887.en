The drive through the talysch-gebirge wildromantisch socio-chic.
The minibus rumpelt on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one could argue that it would be in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here, the Caucasian ethnic group of talyschen that not much is known, except that she speaks perfect Farsi and aserisch and very durable.
endstation lerik.
The small town of flaunts to wuchtig geratener architecture of Soviet times, so don't want to fit into the picturesque mountains.
tourists from Europe hardly come here, too onerous is the directions from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only einspurig.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is not yet arrived here in the province.
But pilata fatulayeva (48) is convinced that lerik the stuff to tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the eurovision-song-festival famous - and next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here is the life of about eight dozen talyschen documented from the area, the older than 100. fatulayeva shows a schwarz-weiß-foto.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years ago a child conceived
But controversial star of the museum is the keeper şirali müslümov, become the 168 years old should be.
, however, there is a birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented people, of the 122 years old, müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he should still have a daughter testified.
Has şirali müslümov so charged in his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, altersforscher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the hochbetagten in Central Asia.
"Many hochaltrige people there are also striking in some areas of China, Japan or the hunza-tal in Pakistan," Scholz says, "also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men."
Due to a lack of documents is, however, no scientific proof of the age to lead, especially personenstandsregister were missing.
Day becherweise melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around lerik remarkably often reach a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are more than 100 years old.
So why live here in the south so many hochbetagte?
The aserische reiseführer Farid mugimzadeh explains the with the specific genes of talyschen.
Museum director Ms. fatulayeva dagegen believes that it's diet chaiselongue.
But cutting the kalorienreiche diet of talyschen love should be so healthy, especially the meat, bread and dairy products and many of whom daily drink a glass of melted butter, dietary is not just plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? In cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of lerik, lives rubaba mirzayeva.
With its 97 years it is for this broad still relatively young.
mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground with a butterfass that you tirelessly hin- and herrollt.
eight people live here under one roof, including one from mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Also two children jump around.
In the kitchen is how guests tea, in the typical, bauchförmigen armadu-gläsern is served.
mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly in reih and link, under your headscarf hides it long, dunkelblonde braids, her son before us reveals proud.
I have my hair always washed with milk, so you I never went out and retained their color.
"shampoo, I have never used," says mirzayeva.
monthly pension is enough for Life
It has only ever eaten what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not once in the supermarket food bought.
Then tells of her husband, who was in the army.
Worst it was in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar aliyew" took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is being driven by the nation's vaterfigur, ruled the country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no hardship among Azerbaijan old.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), gets mirzayeva monthly pension, for local conditions, a sum that you can live well.
And perhaps it is also mirzayevas lñngst ergrauter son right: "the old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, caring and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
