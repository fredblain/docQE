My mexikanisch-amerikanische identity crisis.
Many people were due to the lack of opportunities forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they remind them hard times, he says
navarrette is of the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, as confusion in made me wide.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "de" ("Mexicans"), another for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I grew up in zentralkalifornien and was my whole life "Mexicans".
An ethnic kürzel - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or call my friends in New York "Italians."
Later I opted for "mexikanisch-amerikanisch."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for kürzeln or hyphens,.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to get me into this language on both ends of an interview to say.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week after, when the future Mexican President Enrique pena nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues, which we expected, when the heads of these two countries meeting: immigration, drugs and trade.
pena held was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans now as high likely to remain in Mexico, rather than to emigrate to the United States.
He would like to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc to model of the European Union.
And pena nieto vowed to continue the Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even if he mentioned no details on this.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of ressentiment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single idea in mind that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and forced to leave you more than half its territory by vorgehaltenem rifle to the leadership of the country.
But for Mexicans, in centuries and not think in minutes, are memories of this event not to miss.
Therefore, once a us-regierungsbeamter even mildeste criticism of Mexico is, we hear - and among the elite of the country - in the Mexican press complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour bedrängen.
And the children montezumas proceeded on the kriegspfad.
And yet is the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. people, for the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or großelternteil - who got offered no chance in Mexico and towards the North.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is you.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now have visited the American dream life, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes be blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leaders do not like.
It is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial a humiliating defeat and look down upon us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never good enough, our ties with Mexico never be strong enough.
arguing that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families not in Mexico failed, they would not be gone.
And then we would not now see caught behind the seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally in the United States as a child einwanderte, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans take them this evil.
While American citizen is, sees you as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country to belong.
We love the Mexican band Los tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the bildungsbürgertums would resume their ties to the diaspora.
You want to Mexican Americans as a provisional "Ambassador" for Mexico to represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about it, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leadership to step up their ties to Mexico.
Now.
It will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I fear, because you alone by, friends.
is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to make the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, you must also accept that some Mexican Americans a resentment for, as have their family members were only treated not so long ago.
hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican," than I thought.
