nkú-chef: control of the schwarz-systems failed by verschulden Politics
The Czech Republic in connection with public contracts has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, is back in their application.
In the interview for aktuálně.cz says this is the Vice-President of the highest kontrollamtes (nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, nkú), Miloslav kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and I think that this is not the case with us," said kala the current situation.
To a similar result is apparently a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As negative praxisbeispiel he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "schwarz-system."
The Prime Minister, said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls would harass - so the system is now banned or permitted?
"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the regierungsvorsitzende come, and impede the kontrollamt, whose duty is now even the enforcement of the law, in its activities," kala notes.
At the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Chamber of Deputies they talked about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, under which both countries' laws on public contracts were compared.
So what was it in concrete terms?
There is a parallel examination, with which we have started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is about the fact that the European legislative sets, as are, to build the national legislation on public contracts to handle. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this we have compared, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences say. Generally speaking, are perhaps even something "strict laws in the US and perfect," but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more detailed rules. We must also deal with the actual implementation of the law.
How can you help the project? What is for you from this project?
just such a common control could help that we stop, we constantly seeking perfection of the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this is apparently not particularly positive impact.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to purchase and to exclude illegal enrichment or criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we are achieving this goal.
It may even be that we the system in this way only with excessive paperwork burden"," and those who seek loopholes in the system, have it significantly easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold values remained higher.
You talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech vergabegesetzes.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our nkú, or the system works differently?
With regard to the authorities, is the German equivalent of the nkú bundesrechnungshof, is similarly structured as both work with us and also has a College, this is just something else is formed, authorities is similar.
Also the competences are comparable to a certain extent, and Germany is a state, however, is that there is this Courts of Auditors in the individual States - is the German system differs from our.
The brh may only federal funding control what our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities for us, subject to the control of landesrechnungshöfe there.
As regards the German legislation, is the easier than ours?
In general I would compare it without specific details reluctantly. Nevertheless, Germany is in some ways, often referred to as a model, and you certainly cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
Perhaps that is where the auditors are better?
This is certainly not, but as I said, such comparisons may not particularly like.
This is still worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, also have problems to contend with.
Otherwise you would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, is it not?
As regards the Czech legislation, which was important for your authority the revision of the vergabegesetzes, feel they have any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in force, it is in our tests have not yet.
As our controls nachträglich, we must take place here with some delay.
implications we feel so far more in the preparation of future controls - as we have introduced the new instrument "recognition of risks inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed - this will impact the changes of course, as the thresholds to change the conditions for certain types of tenders were modified.
You see the adoption of this law more positive, or the system will be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption confirmed.
It can occur, however, the problem that the rules are "strict" and can no longer be met.
Under the previous Rules are a test unterzogenen people accountable to the carriers (for example, in the case of operational programmes of regional policy, the regional council) dahingehend that any failure to comply with the vergabegesetzes amounts to a breach of discipline.
It makes sense, but then to make the law even tougher?
I do not believe in this way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not penalise those who have made a formal errors, on the real decision-making not impact.
Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say first of all, which way is not successful.
The Prime Minister recently said that allowing the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "schwarz-systems" behelligen würde - what does that mean exactly?
The schwarz-system is now banned or allowed?
A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the regierungsvorsitzende come, and hinder the kontrollamt, whose duty is now even the enforcement of the law, in its activities.
He said: "We can change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we act as if nothing would be.
The vergabegesetz contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is right for the protection of the public competition.
But on the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone because of formfehlern is excluded.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing with us.
