"psg is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have with psg a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of psg erklären.
Great players have come.
Every day I do on your side progress.
The technical staff has given me too much.
These elements spur me on a daily basis to improve my spielniveau.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football, everything is very quickly.
But I breche not in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF clairefontaine until my season in saint-etienne I have always made gradual progress.
They take advantage of thus introduced by Carlo ancelotti competition...
The latest additions this summer are accustomed to win games is very high level.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me, must offer the forehead and wants to give his best.
It gives me Carlo ancelotti much in relation to my spielposition.
He is supported by co-trainern as Claude makelele, who played in the same position as me.
ancelotti is the right person for the job?
,.
ancelotti flößt all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious vereinen.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a verletzungsserie.
The confidence that he has put in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think of the first part of the season of psg?
In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of the spitzenreiters Lyon us.
But we lurk in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the first knockout round in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we are against very good European teams have our say.
First of all we want to first of our group in Porto, so that we can complete the second leg of the achtelfinales as home.
Can the psg in the short term, a major European club?
He already has the budget for...
In order to be a major European club, Paris title win and make a name for himself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially is the psg the resources, so that this project takes concrete forms.
It would be a big failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really close to our hearts, this title abzusahnen.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to the victory davonzutragen.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally should be master with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right thing to do.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux to win the title rings, I believe that we have the stuff to him.
Do you think that the media too much of the psg expect?
In view of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept the perfect.
However, if we in a home game against troyes 4-0 win, and it still is, something you can accuse us, this is certainly something frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never every weekend with 4-0 win.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We try to set up a concept.
A team builds up over time.
shown in the Champions League we have strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons is unable to qualify for the first knockout round, and has also made huge spending.
In terms of the sums invested believed you to spielpause with 15 points ahead!
This means that our opponents and ignored the French championship would.
Lyon and Marseille, the last season were not good, from this new psg "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May the smiling winner and tell us that we have won, despite all the difficulties.
The psg seems completely from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic abhängig to be.
So much the better, that speaks of a "zlatan-abhängigkeit."
This means that Ibrahimovic is really powerful and scores many goals.
That is why he came and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has reminded that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done, is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their spielniveau.
thiago Silva, is one of the world's best defenders, allows all other also to make progress.
As you have seen the 2012 with the French national team?
As disappointment.
It was very important to me to participate in this em.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented from something playing herauszuschlagen.
I have seen things there, emerged strengthened from which I am.
Today it was me to achieve good games in the national team.
This was for my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must demonstrate exemplary behavior.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.
The nationaltrainer is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make no comparison.
Blanc had achieved its aim, by he had qualified for the European championships.
I hope that Didier deschamps the "Bleus" will lead to Brazil.
is on 16 October in Spain forced unentschieden (1:1), a auftaktspiel?
game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used for all the other.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
