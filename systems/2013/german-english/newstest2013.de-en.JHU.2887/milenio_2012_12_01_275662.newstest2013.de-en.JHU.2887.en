cause of a die due to AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the untersuchungsergebnis confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success "abzuschwächen tried."
He hid it in his family.
He decided to care just about his illness and started to be informed, and this with such use, that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the hiv-einheit hospital civil de Guadalajara (hcg), in which he came after several fighting in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the humane immundefizienz-virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
Then it avoided even the director of a clinic of imss to adopt," because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to this syndrome with quality of life to survive.
However, there are still many people in the clinic, which know nothing of their disease and where the virus has already has harmed and exhausted their immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, that is the date of the first reported cases," the great success today, means that the survival of patients, the treatment starts on time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the hiv-einheit of hcg, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
An expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 schlussfolgerten that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life by the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the start of treatment depended, and that those would have greater opportunities that are not drogenabhängig: up to 30 years in a census of 200 cd4 and 50 years for a census of 500 cd4.
Simply put, mean that the above speech, who at the age of 25 years the diagnosis hiv-positiv gets "can easily be 75 years old, in this sense, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to view this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report), it is still true that reduced the Onusida) Since the release of the AIDS 60 percent of the patients died entered into the national database.
alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the month of May this year there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that it since 2005 have universal access to anti-retroviral drugs.
- Why so people still die from it?
- in my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no versorgungsprobleme in the drugs. The problem is that the people in far advanced state come because you do not know your infektionszustand, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a resounding statement: "nine out of ten patients have come to us if you already have an accompanying infektion. earlier diagnoses are needed in order to influence the global mortality, which is why all people, where this is necessary, massive screening tests should be offered."
This proposal are the experts and officials of the consejo habilidad de prevención del Sida en Jalisco (coesida) (state Committee to aids-vermeidung in Jalisco) and Fabrizio patients how to carry out the test at a private laboratory ließ, for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already was in the aids-phase and even the kaposi's sarcoma (had a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and don't want to hear.
"If I have to die, then to burst," says three times in my case.
The change was to improve, I ernähre me well, practise sport and take the drugs.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, go much, have an active, but responsible sexleben, I am on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio count on the agreed to share his intimate details with milenio Jalisco, in his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global aids-tages fear.
They should make the test, if you belong to the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, you should learn how to like all people can live responsibly.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In this particular locations "was actually increased the distribution of condoms; previously they were individually made, now give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
risikopersonen for new infections include the young people.
"Why do you need?" is a common spottfrage, orientierungspersonal in schools, employees in pharmacies and by social workers in the health care system, the young people don't want to suspend, assured the correspondent.
He proposed to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but are in ausgabegeräten in public toilets of facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It is not be promoting promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González in response to the question, whether under his administration präservative would be distributed.
"sexuality is not; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
of Jalisco schlüsseldaten
There are 13.435 kumulierte cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is national seen in 4th place new and cumulative AIDS, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of ansteckungsfälle erfolgen on geschlechtsverkehr, 6% of the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are for every registered case 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
