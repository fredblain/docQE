messenger: NASA discovered ice on the mercury
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is on the planet mercury ice.
The ice cover is may be up to 20 metres thick.
The U.S. space NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there is frozen water there, as stated in three studies published on Thursday in the journal "science".
The probe messenger have found evidence that the permanently in the shadow of the region of the planet is the ice sheet.
This should be at least 30 centimetres and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
may also the water probably came from comets or asteroids that are taken on the mercury.
No one put the discovery of ice but linked to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger-sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the mercury can reach up to 2 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system have reached.

Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope will 1608 have been invented by Hans lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei it a year later to sternenbeobachtung began.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes are growing - and the insights they provide, deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the hale-teleskop in palomar-observatorium near San Diego the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the large binocular telescope telescope.
It can look into all equal about two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
the inner workings of the Gran telescopio canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - alone the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
, he achieved a diameter of about 11 meters.
detriment of cheap design: the telescope is in his elevation festgezurrt - and thus limited in his mobility.
Also the hobby-eberly-teleskop in Texas is fixed in elevation.
Its feature: the high lichtsammelkraft.
This is - despite comparatively low spiegeldurchmesser - to the world's largest spiegelteleskope approaches.
With the help of a radioteleskops in arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers hear it all for alien signals.
The radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 meters.

Here is the very large telescope - which makes his name all honour.
With its four mirrors the telescope can also the average infrarotspektrum illumination.

Since April 24, 1990, it already images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the space telescope kepler looks for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the NASA announced that 1235 planetenkandidaten since missionsbeginn were identified.

scientists assume that in the South Pole of the mercury ice exists.
However, there is no reliable data, as the messenger far closer to the North Pole to the planet kreist.
radarmessungen have for decades darauf hingedeutet, that there is on the mercury ice.
launched by the 2004 messenger-sonde - the first, which underpins mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
