Time to be bored in a constantly elektrisierten world it is beautiful,
This thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems turned out and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not lie.
half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iphones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and kindesentwicklungsexperten führen boredom as something positive.
When it comes to you, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.
So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, potentially promotes creativity.
And because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, we will no longer benefit from the advantages of boredom.
So we should the boredom welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
This I come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "boredom: a lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011), it is not.
"Indeed, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The hauswände pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom actually.
John D. eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York In Ontario, Canada, that is the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long reading forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea before a fokusgruppe of about 100 people Professor eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as they want to experience," a satisfactory activity, but this cannot be able to "define.
boredom is different from apathy, therefore, to the effect that the person is not employed, but that would be.
At the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to "disruption of the aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
boredom is therefore almost as to listen to as depression.
However, Professor eastwood believes that although these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes, we believe that US is boring, even if we only have difficulties to focus.
In their study," the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention "- in English, about:" The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention, "which was published in September in The Journal perspectives on psychological Science", Professor eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants zuhörten tape, on which a person a magazinartikel vorlas.
Some groups heard a loud TV from the neighbouring region that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group had heard these sounds not at all.
The people who barely audible television heard, made to feel more bored than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to concentrate on a difficult and demanding job, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says mark J. fenske, Associate Professor of neuroscience at the University of guelph In Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you prefer a monotonous work exercised - "as the search for faulty products to a fabrikförderband, music can distract and help, not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, this can even fight by people physically remain attentive.
"studies have shown that children who herumhampeln dürfen, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sitting still," says Professor fenske.
All of us will eventually boring - my late flight, a dröhnender speakers, a particularly ermüdender film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers have developed a "scale in the 1980s to langeweileanfälligkeit."
On the scale are statements such as "many of the things I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers found that young is more boring than girls, so Stephen vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of westflorida - particularly with regard to the need for more and greater diversity externer reize.
But in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter haufen.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment by, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted.
He found that 32% of teenagers in school were doing homework and the bored, while 23% data to be bored, if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents gave, to feel bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages are about boredom increase or decrease.
He was sure, however, that "the youth is seen as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on your alltagsablauf.
back to my ursprungsfrage: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to relieve them - the studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades.
"with the boredom to the brain a saying that we should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not always know what you should do it best.
If one is boring and you use this energy to play guitar and to cook, will be happy.
But television can provide glücksgefühle in the short term, but these verflüchtigen long-term again.
So who's bored child an iPad is enough, but they can turn it off the boredom. It has not learned to talk or to control themselves, says Professor fenske.
And he adds: "selbstkontrolle transfers from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also receives more selbstkontrolle in other areas.
I do not believe that we should boredom celebrate.
We should also not see too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to us off the permanent aktivitäts- and technologieberieselung wohlzufühlen.
Professor eastwood agrees.
"It sounds so as to be more boring to us. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something useful," he says.
He believes that the people in truth only look for a way to shut down and relax.
"in an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to beschäftigen, once the noise is silent."
