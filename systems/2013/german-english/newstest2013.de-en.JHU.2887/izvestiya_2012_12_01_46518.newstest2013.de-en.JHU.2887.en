"The brain is so far only moderately überlisten"
The supporters of modern technologies popular issue of augmented reality is usually seen through the lens of a special glasses in recent times.
First, Google in the summer, a working model at its annual conference in November was then know that Microsoft had such a patent pending.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3d-technologies in microsoft-labor in Cambridge shahram izadi, is clear, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a durchgangsstation.
It's the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and virtual space to create.
- please describe a brief, what research your group operates.
- we are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity is largely stuck in the period in which worked with pixels on flat screens, sometimes will also be affected.
However, we want 5-10 years vorausblicken and predict the radical changes this interaction.
For example, the xbox-konsole and the kinect-sensoren a step forward, and today is no longer sold without kinect xbox, as all interested in motion control.
- what awaits us in the future?
- although kinect the interaction has brought on a physical level, is much still on the flat, sometimes in 3D.
The entry of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet decisive.
We try to change, work in a real three-dimensional darstellungssystemen on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We have the computer world in our physical world entlassen and make it fassbarer.
To this end, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its surroundings is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
First and foremost we should these bescheuerten virtual-reality-helme Los!
- what do you think about sprachsteuerung?
It is popular, but it will not overvalued?
- It is certainly not the allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because they are not always all umstehenden would like to inform about his actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers good, however, each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of governance of objects in public places on a project, for which short and narrow, instead of spreading gesten experimentierten.
The gestures were not recorded by the objektkamera, but by a bracelet, the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
It is still relatively large, could in theory be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future, mixed steuerungstypen, for example, gestures and language.
- As?
For example - we would you ask me to give you this sprudeldose to rich?
They say it and, at the same time it.
- Normally I say it simply.
- oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- this means that they want the user can afford to adapt what a machine at the time and what is not?
- not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the next time we especially need to be working on the development of new sensortypen, which make it possible to capture reactions of people more.
The can, for example be lasersensoren, as they offer in depth a good resolution, which is very important.
- which claims they are on the basis of their work with the xbox kinect-sensoren on modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, deep or something else?
- the current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, would be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithmen more work.
It is not only the resolution along the X and y, but also along the z-axis are taken into account.
, the speed and the number of frames per second are important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 fps, particularly for gestures too little.
Stephen betishes entwickelte in our laboratory in redmond a berührungssensor with an adjustable verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
influenced not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without berührungssteuerung and with more frames per second.
- the number of cameras should not be increased?
- kinect is currently working with three "cameras," and one of them actually a infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary rgb-kamera.
It is not used to calculate the objekttiefe.
More cameras may solve the problem...
or increase the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be a flexible, kinect-ähnliches system, in which we could play with various kameraneigungen to see how we help the three-dimensional ermittlung a position.
- if I remember rightly, Microsoft, in contrast to Google's glasses not to the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life the glasses has the best prospects?
- of course it is not pleasant to keep unterwegs always collected a smartphone in the hand, but I think the following: the tollste variant would be a "changing" augmented reality, in which we have a cloud of the glasses could switch to the smartphone,
The glasses is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private only you can see), but at the same time its weakness, because an augmented reality through glasses prevents you can work together with other virtual objects.
- let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony stark in iron man, but also normalsterblichen accessible.
There is a problem, to the critics frequently this idea out: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing!
The answers to your group on this point?
- In my lectures, I often talk of the augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of sensitive perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of second hand as something unusual projektionsunterlage.
It takes pressure notável true!
But there are also technologies that actually are aimed at the "pictures in the air" to give a robust, for example, produces the interference by some gerichteten ultraschallstrahlen is in a certain point where the finger, a feeling, but at the moment is still so weak, as pustete someone on the handballen.
There are also tapes for the wrist to nervenendungen effect on the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- have you tried to fool the brain?
It to think that it can feel what it should feel, if it sees something?
- it is a good idea, so we have not yet tried.
Here lies another task on which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a people that has to be physically located in a closed room, think that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
so far is only moderately outwit the brain, and we still have many busy years.
It is precisely that which makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers so attractive: on many issues we are only at the beginning.
