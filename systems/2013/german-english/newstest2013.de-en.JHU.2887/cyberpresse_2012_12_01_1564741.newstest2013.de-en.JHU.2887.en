prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: should be made the test or not?
The psa-test way in fact sometimes incorrect results, with false negative, but also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to more hesitation the already unentschlossenen men for the implementation of früherkennungstests.
The test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two medical specialists obtained.
In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that, when a nachbeobachtung after 12 years, the likelihood the formation of Metastases is 30 to 40% higher, if no screening was carried out.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer.
For men afro-amerikanischer origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as a cancer was detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others, the indolent.
The patient must be shown the extent of the risk of its cancer really made clear by him the possible options, where prostatakrebse untreated, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases rather opting for an active monitoring of the disease.
For many men, in which you have cancer detected, no treatment place today because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring and offers you a treatment in progression of the disease.
We certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who does not.
That is why I recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.
However, it is most important to speak with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for urology movember has developed an instrument, with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of psa-tests.

Prevention the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move enough.
"if there were no more smokers, this would value at least 50% increase," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian krebsgesellschaft.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian krebsgesellschaft the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It seriously damages the health of people.
"Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian krebsgesellschaft fördern overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, grimmdarm- mastdarm- speiseröhren- bauchspeicheldrüsen- and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity during the entire life against grimmdarmkrebs protects," he adds.
The food
The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In too much of it increases the risk of developing a grimm- bzw. mastdarmkrebs.
meats should also be avoided.
The conservation of meat by räuchern, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogenic.
"the latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists examined the link between vitaminzusätzen and cancer.
But their investigations are currently not conclusive.
After the Canadian krebsgesellschaft are the studies on Vitamin E contradictory.
During a study the reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, showed another more of an increase.
shown the effect of Vitamin D on the cancer was also not yet clear.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu, stresses how important it is to speak with his doctor about his concerns and his family vorbelastung.
"the implementation of a früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer."
