Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was on a ministerratssitzung of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as zwanzigstes Member of this space. Poland is included with the second Member State from the former eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 esa-mitglied).
Poland started in 1994 a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years in several esa-projekten.
The way of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish kosmosbegeisterte employees with the space, but they do not always on understanding stießen.
I refer, for example, of the lecture by A.\ xC5 ternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work presented "entrance to the outer space exploration."
The ideas of the young engineer (born. However, 1905) made the audience cold, and after years remembered\ xC5 ternfeld yet that only Dr. Jan gadomski had shown interest in his work.
\ xC5 ternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the outer space exploration" by Robert esnault-pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten Prix rep-hirsch.
Dr. Jan gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of the space was ua. dadurch acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a eisenbahn-draisine was built in Poland, for which a raketenantrieb was planned.
The author of the proposal and the details of this project were unfortunately unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or to brake the draisine should be used.
The information come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry, to deal with raketenbetriebenen floors.
The research led the Institute komórka techniki uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw wolfke and Prof. gustaw mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents which that the research to the stage of practical tests vorgedrungen war.
But the research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
in 1937, in the press of dipl.eng. rohoziński stammende draft fotoelektrischen jagdrakete on, and the following year was the work of "rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza leliwa-krzywoblocky" of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of raketentechnik from temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo-naukowy) coordinated.
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work was completed its work, however, the war began.
More articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish raumfahrtgesellschaft (polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is in 1954 in the November edition of the Journal problemy, in which four long articles are devoted to the space.
The article by Prof. M. subotowicz contains the proposal to create a raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there was already the first projects for comparison, and it was clear that the Exploration of Space future would have.
Already in its beginnings in 1956 was the Polish raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accede to the International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA was founded in 1951 in the autumn of 1956 ordinary Member.
The following year, the first pta-vorsitzende, Kazimierz zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space.
held he had this position until his death in 1959.
since 1956, the PTA maßgeblich took part in the development of highly successful meteorological rakete (rakieta meteorologiczna), the first Polish rakete for scientific research.
The first type, the rm-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958.
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1,800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the rm-1a, built, and began in 1959 in the błędów-wüste flugtests with the zweistufenrakete rm-2.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development should already be able to make real scientific work - the rakete rm-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of höhenwinden used.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
rm, the successor to the first missiles of the type from 1962 to 1965 entwickelte meteor-1-rakete.
The rocket was designed as zweistufenrakete, their total fraud 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.
From this rakete three types have been developed (meteor-1a, -1b and -1c), which differed from each other in the size of transportraums for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1a-rakete had a transportraum with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1b about 0,34 liters and meteor-1c 0,62 litres.
The maximum altitude fraud in all three types 37 km.
In the 1965 to 1968 was developed in luftfahrtinstitut meteor-2-rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 miles.
Then, the versions meteor-2h and meteor-3 built.
Also worth noting is the accession of Poland to cospar (Committee for space research) in 1960, on the creation of a national cospar-ausschusses followed two years later.
Poland was also involved in the framework of the interkosmos-programms with Soviet satellites in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot miroslaw hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimír Remek zweiter interkosmonaut.
