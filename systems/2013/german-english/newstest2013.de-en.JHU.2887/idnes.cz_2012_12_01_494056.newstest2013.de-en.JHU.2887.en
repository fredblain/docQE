The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court the law on voluntary work.
This decision gave rise to a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the issue time from a wider perspective.
The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant speculation.
due to the large differences in the value of work (löhne) It comes to preisspannungen.
Under this term is through a state trying to understand where the manufacturers, imports of cheaper goods in the economic competition, making the competition for usurping "unterbietet," with a greater market share and increase its profit.
This means on a large scale for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business there. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs.
As the capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, necessarily the spending increase.
This situation is made even worse by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby to replace the total economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practices of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce artificially the social level of their own people and thus to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The objective of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital in particular lohnbereich.
This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other by reducing workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are several years ago public lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people, are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it regularly to cases in which workers such a small salary that the state must increase their income to subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employees workers exposed.
The austerity measures of practically all eu-südstaaten undoubtedly will amount to the same condition, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance darben on the margins of society and do hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here is, of course, the question of where this capital is?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty moves from one country to another; or the capital remains altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages.
This all of Latin America.
liberal theories and media claim that the state must not with capital involved in its own economy ad nauseam, and that planned economy lead to economic disaster.
Private capital engstirnig insists on his position that the state does not lenkend should intervene in the economy.
But then we must ask if the capital the policy and to the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even beyond.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically ubiquitous almighty and in all States lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual bevorteilung, of legislation, is criminally punishable, but nothing in the virtually everything.
The situation in Germany is such that a staatsministerium due to a lack of finances private, closely with the industry verflochtene rechtsunternehmen tasked with formulating gesetzentwürfen.
These bills will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
The violence is no longer, as the Western verfassungen announce, but of strong financial groups, from the people who prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly fall into a situation, as you appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman republic at times cäsars and pompeius' describes: "the state has long been understood in the collapse, and the offices were filled by violence.
against schmiergeld, through illegal erschleichung of benefits or with stone and sword.
corruption has grown hemmungslos vote already purchased, and the people went to the election... "" People with character bewarben not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul... "" I really started talking about it, that the only medicine is a one-man rule in this difficult situation, and that should be a strong man elected... "appian thought it to him, but the strong man was finally Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the one-man rule.
As it turns out, is today's society as well as in ancient times based on the reckless preference of their own advantage, without paying attention to societal interests.
The private sector is by its very nature, not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognize and enforce.
Now, as then, the result is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, not in the slightest seek deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore look to the ruthless liberalisation of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current state, the sinking this regime for liberal democracies can be regarded as some pause, already looming in the next round.
particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are already today, and witnessed the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work here is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to press down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systembedingt.
The only solution is targeted politisch-soziale reforms, to increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
