szabo: "German must play greater role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen szabo, an expert on US-European relations, positioned Berlin for a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then enthielt Berlin.
Why?
Stephen szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have not done.
must now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But, at the same time, I believe that it not supported the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained, when it came to set up a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, that is true.
This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy switches and away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
reflected the Germans are so between the fronts.
expected of them, that you have a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think you buttons are still approach to their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
have a foreign policy, as France or Britain.
What is a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy from economic policy is motivated, so of exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike that of the other great powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Had these interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not to offend the.
This plays a role in any case.
But I would also not want to attach too much importance to, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it plays an important role in any case in German thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by it has abstained on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that, in Europe and even in the US there is great sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.
But because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international player and its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, have clearly in favour of a veto.
There are differences between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of American domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, that position public.
I believe that the real differences are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so hellauf begeistert of Netanyahu's policies.
It is difficult for Germany, its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other to agree?
I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead pushing things out of their own position.
do precisely with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position.
This is, of course, not simply for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the German, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as a major global player - Germany wants to assume a major role at all?
Or is Germany the lead still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it still is unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it difficult to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time Germany will assume a greater role, verschiedenste anti-deutsche feelings freely.
This makes it the German not easy.
This is actually the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be susceptible to various neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics continuously from, the EU not fill this vacuum at the moment but who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
