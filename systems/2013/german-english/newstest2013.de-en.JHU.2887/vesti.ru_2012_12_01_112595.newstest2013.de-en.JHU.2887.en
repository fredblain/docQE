birth in space
Earth danger.
Global warming or zusammenstoß with killerasteroid.
caravans of raumschiffen erdbewohnern aboard are on the search for a ersatzplaneten.
In order to save humanity, the important question is how we in the weightlessness or on the ersatzplaneten fortpflanzen can?
Many choices in my opinion, there is not.
De facto, there are only two real planet, we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomische sternberg-instituts Vladimir surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars vergleichsweise lebensfreundlich are, there is on the surface of Venus a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in all, possible.
The issue of reproduction in the all treated the researchers first of all in relation to the flora.
already half a century before that were carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation in orbit gezüchteten erbsen difference is not in the least of the species on Earth.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how the weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It is a normal chicks.
But then the problem. begins
"The problem is that the chicken stop must find; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laborleiter of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische problems ran, Vladimir sychew.
Without firm untergrund überschlugen the chicks wild.
ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the neugeborenen fixării unui.
The chicks were not reacting to light and loud.
Four days later they died then simply.
"twice we were chicks hatch and found the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," hält Vladimir sychew for a failed experiment with the chicken in the all clear.
The last brutkäfig with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, will be based on the biosatelliten "bion" only same-sex species are.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilized were sent into space.
prinzipiell noted it was nothing special.
"It was just with the biosatelliten, but again, it was just a single experiment, and the research must continue," said Vladimir sychew.
After landing bekamen the weltraumratten nachwuchs.
The issue of reproduction directly in space you could not solve so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat, simply cannot follow their fortpflanzungstrieb.
In contrast to animals could man it in principle.
abstraktem think the Homo sapiens is capable and can produce a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk there was in Tereshkova.
The most precious that mankind has, is the female body.
Our möwe flew them, and no one on earth would you can answer the following question: übersteht the space?
It is after this flight can bring a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered this question," says raumfahrtveteran wachtang watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after their space, gave birth to the first female kosmonautin, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, andrijan nikolajew, was also kosmonaut.
In 1988 gave birth to the second woman in all, swetlana sawizkaja twice was in orbit, and even work outside the raumfahrzeugs verrichtete, a son.
, remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut to long flights, where all went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in the orbit," concludes kosmonaut waleri poljakow, Hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet the humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in vorbereitungszentrum cosmonaut is a mandatory station during the flugvorbereitung.
Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small ichtyander zeugnis of drop that life on the land the ocean entstieg.
There is a connection between the fact that approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid as a child is, and that it can more easily get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swim just 2 weeks go by.
"This is too little time to forget something," says babyschwimmlehrerin Marina aksenowa.
While for a newborn child so the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness is the bauch- and beckenmuskulatur extremely fast back and so has the ability, the child herauszupressen.
Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende hilfsmittel.
The birth could also take place in a spezialkammer, for example, to the child herauszupressen.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also artificial gravity.
Without the erdanziehung to feel, the organism the skeleton and muscles cannot train.
A newborn child in orbit cannot be set as an adult for training in a belastungsanzug.
It is simply the lack of, which is vital for his life.
"This experiment that we make, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, we will lead to a disabled, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world," says the head of the Institute for medizinisch-biologische bioethikkommission problems ran, Igor pestow, advance.
So far, the birth of children in space theory.
At some point, but they become reality if the erdbewohner in their space ships to a distant planet up, all of the home for their geborenen nachkommen.
