\ xC5 imon ornest: at our concerts we want positive energy sammeln
What do you think about that in less than a month of doomsday is due to take place?
This is one of those katastrophenmeldungen, to which we humans so like anspringen.
We do with our band the tap tap more fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the doomsday to stop or prevent.
In December you realize also a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.
You can our readers the project closer to vorstellen?
It is a landesweite benefizveranstaltung, which we have two years.
For this, we want to use the maya-kalenders marketingpotenzial whose end for the 21 December at 11:10 a.m. prognostiziert is.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, will take place from 21:00 gleichzeitig three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts to be roughly at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a zeitzone for 12 hours ahead of the Mayan calendar ends.
By whom is this idea?
Originally think of me, then we have the idea together with our graphic honza Augusta fleshed out.
We would not gain enough positive energy to the doomsday to prevent, but we also want to cooperate with the public, what state we consider this world once handed over to our children.
At the end of the maya-kalenders we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and schlüsselanhängern against the doomsday, with their purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band the tap tap, together with other performers also included the so-called anthem against the weltuntergang entitled "doomsday is from."
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will also on the benefizkonzerten erklingen?
Of course, and in the end, provided that all is fine and the weltuntergang takes place...
The anthem will be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
Also, the hymns together in a direktschaltung by Czech television broadcast live.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš hanák, who also plays the main role of Jesus in the video clip, also xindl X singt with...
How did you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, that implies that we achieve many fundraisers and concerts.
We strive to these people closely involved in our projects.
It was clear that most are interested in cooperation with us, and enjoy it.
What purpose benefits the proceeds of the concerts against the doomsday?
For the establishment of the barrier bildungszentrums studeo, where we already six years together with the Association tap in jedlička-institut work.
The students of the jedlička-instituts are regularly maintained by editors that help them in different activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to the editors go, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the jedlička-instituts should create its own building in which we then move in with this project.
Each concert treten several groups and performers.
according to what criteria they have chosen?
We wanted a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague treten chinaski, for example, support lesbiens illustratosphere with Dan bárta, the tap tap, marián bango and Jiří suchý.
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "events" are also planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are ever in the United States - this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their auslandspläne are not just small, so far, they are already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The tap tap is, however, a group, made up of people with disabilities.
How you manage these travel locistics and organisational?
It is not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our Members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage. We must also, of course, many instrumentenkoffer and other luggage mitschleppen...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, čsa and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I am sometimes have partly been surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By their foreign travel, you have a comparison, as it looks in the various countries with accessibility, as it deals with disabled people.
As you have seen these things?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnesses to the fact that the East is everything still in its infancy.
In Prague, Moscow is not disabled. It is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre is on the way.
It is not even there, of course, that there is a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator vorlässt.
Fortunately, entstehen clubs there, are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way we must catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things, in which we later on...
It is, however, still be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal for people with severe disabilities selbstständig in public space, go to the museum, toilets can use.
But it is not just üblich, that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in the public arena, where we are with the band The tap tap the West a little ahead!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if major athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers from our ranks, are things really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken personalities.
The tap tap is very popular at the moment. But if we go back a couple of years: what has it in 1998 motivated to start a band?
At the time I started as a supervisor in jedlička-institut, where I met many young people who were interested in to deal with something hard.
And since I myself am musicians and ua. saxofon games, I, together with a colleague a musik-ag founded.
Well, and with time is that as our leader, láďa angelovič is wont to say, something out of control (laughs).
became known the band but only in the last few years, or Am I mistaken?
It is true that has helped us cooperation with famous singers; we have also started to campaign actively for us to.
We are aware that, if something is doing and this is not to see on the outside, their own performance in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to the eu-fördergelder we can also do good editors, high quality equipment and u.ä..
It was their goal, it with the tap tap so far to bring?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that can things in a different way.
copied in show business today often one of the other.
This is logical, in its own way as everything new viewed with caution and only after a long time will be accepted.
There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of the viewers usually is, of course, pity; this is only natural.
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned nature, which we regret müssten.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if you have the funds to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities in something, this is a progress not only for themselves, but for the whole of society.
It was for this success also helpful, that you are a strict boss, as we hear from many people?
If you would like to do something well, we must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain discipline.
But this is, in my view, completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you find that you need to have test twice a week, vorbereitungsphasen absolvieren and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then erlischt enthusiasm in many quickly.
It works everywhere, in every band who work seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently, the tap tap 20 members.
How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998 in this?
A single: láďa angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. You cannot prevent.
Who has the will and the desire on the part, is welcome at any time.
