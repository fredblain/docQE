The mvrdv architects show that the real adventure are not only in the head - the example of spijkenisse and the recently errichteten bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find this funny, it looks futuristic buildings, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette verhaig, a passantin roadside.
And Stefan spermon, it-techniker in a nearby großbetrieb, says: "But, well, it is already the House."
But I wonder, what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man is still voluntarily in one of these old-style-bibliotheken, right?
spijkenisse, a barely besichtigungsbedürftige schlafstadt at the gates of Rotterdam, is strange rekordhalter.
The 80.000-einwohner-gemeinde has the lowest bildungsrate across the Netherlands.
To counter this stupid situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to the education and the seven fictional bridges, which are displayed on the euroscheinen than pretty bepinselte stahlbetonminiaturen nachzubauen.
The success of the bildungsoffensive stayed in check.
And so, recognized the stadtväter that there is only one way, the statistics to be Mr: a library to her.
winy Maas from Rotterdam architekturbüro mvrdv, master of tollkühnen balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen, sometimes cynical buildet, took the matter with his usual composure and appeared to wettbewerbs-hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on her face.
And while the jury still verdutzt looked and with the achseln zuckte stapelte the cheeky Maas his exquisite mitbringsel the size to a pyramid and finished his aktionistisch untermauerte speech with the words: "love stadtgemeinde!"
It is, therefore, my proposal for the bücherberg spijkenisse, for the so-called boekenberg!
Nine years later, of the 30 million Berg aufgeschüttet.
It is part of a revitalisierungsprojekts, belong to the garage, supermarket, post office and a few neighbouring residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.
At the beginning of November, the bücherberg awarded the second prize "best library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project for the Dutch national wood award 2012 nominated.
This is not the faceless kleinstadtretorte, which until now had more to offer than a postmodern pedestriansed and a stunned hässliches radnice, behind the White walls would be inclined to suspect a molkereifabrik to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, spijkenisse now has the first public kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: büchereldorado under käseglocke.
There is a lift, the right through the hills, but the real space and lesefreuden erschließen euphonix fußläufigen climb the topography.
The rundum verglaste interior is bright and clear, the gebrannte klinkerboden and elegant straßenlaternen speak in the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for park bench, dog and boys and girls playing football.
Everywhere and books, books, books.
"normally, the bücherregale along the facade, and in the middle is a big, dark room, the most uncomfortable and impersonal," says winy Maas.
We have the classic raumkonfiguration on its head and the reading area from inside to outside. They
The Interior of the bücherbergs is sent used: in the middle are offices, internet-bibliothek schachclub, umweltzentrum and haustechnikzentrale.
A particular pleasure is the black bücherregale, the time wandverkleidung, sometimes brüstung, sometimes stiegengeländer.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and bauingenieure whether of the unknown baustoffs shake their heads.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," said joop trouborst, project manager at the borough spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen agrarbetrieb one day met with a suitable waste from agriculture.
For many years, we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes kunststoffvlies as wurzelunterlage.
That is cheap and zeiteffizient.
The thin текстильного holds a, two saisonen, then it is ready for the sperrmüll.
pressed for the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantitiesñposes four centimeters thick plates.
Under hitzeeinwirkung and pressure in the so-called landbouwplastic (klp) to a dark, homogeneous belastungsfähigen material that was a after new cars and was a reeks sportschuh.
After 105 stufen is we reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long tour will be in literaturcafé not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch kroketten and eingetopften ficusbäumen rewarded.
They provide for atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in literaturgebirge.
donations for the new Soul
"You would not believe it, but this House is in spite of the many glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology," says trouborst.
heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the bücherberg under a glassturz, the sun is shining even on sunny days only briefly into the interior.
The broad holzleimbinder standing across the glass, serve as a shade and catch a large part of the sunlight.
The climate is very pleasant.
fully automatic blinds. Do the Rest
Stefan spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already dared the way in the new library.
Also Lisette verhaig was already there.
And also the tcm-lehrerin cynthia bogarde, the boekenberg even as spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: to open a few weeks ago, each residents invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
It is for the time being the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces - be filled.
The concept is caught on.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation has now each residents a certain relationship with this new House.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
This is mvrdv those königsdisziplin gelungen, the man called in the jargon identitätsstiftung.
spijkenisse literaturgeschichte written.
So young and uneducated, they may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
