"The people want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," said okamura.
Mr senator, how you get to the idea to stand for the office of President?
It is not about me, Senator or President to be.
If everything would work without any problems in our country, I would run nowhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic plundered for 20 years will, as thieves around freely, while the people's taxes and the retirement age be increased.
I had no ambitions to be politicians.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and that independent and parteilos, I have no option but to influence things, to run for the office of a senator or the President.
In the Senate, they have succeeded and then immediately made on the road to the castle.
return it not their voters the back?
I have said all the time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the result of senatswahlen.
Later I have this clarified and said that I will run for the office of President, if I am elected senator.
But my goal is not function. The function is an instrument, with whom I can do my vision.
That I need as much influence as possible and as a strong mandate.
The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television complaining, but every niedermachen who wants to make a difference.
In addition, the media, the honour rauben wish, and confuse the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
about me was, for example, claims that I would journalists are or that I was Jiří Paroubek consultants.
We are talking about their visions.
The fight for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as retroactive vermögenserklärungen included over 20 million Crowns.
You need to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can table legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As ordinary citizens, I have argued that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone from the right or from the left with a good proposal is rejected, it is deliberately, and this keeps the population only.
As an independent parteiloser I have a much greater potential to win support for all political parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that I am without schubladendenken and parteidogmen of each party can take what is best for our country.
See you as a man in politics more to the right or left?
From Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people give me more left.
For me, this rechts-links-denken but totally irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we can make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone to the left or to the right camp belongs; I would like to human beings.
I always support publicly every good approach, even if it comes from the ksčm or of the ODS, and I will turn against bad ideas.
It bothers you, if someone described as populists.
But confirm the not by what you have just said?
If you draw up a business plan in a company, then you have a idealziel and a vision.
And this would you approach.
This can be as far as I am concerned call populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world already, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you only keywords.
And that brings you in politics in the long term not far away.
Or do you think that you, if you only long enough to talk to the people, will be able to enforce the material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them on our side, to achieve these goals.
It would be no problem for me, as President, the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to urge the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors on to the statute book.
And the raised müssten may then say why you object to this.
A strong personality, which highlights abuses, can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, which was a credit of the public pressure.
I would like to say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy I have only just started and attempts to find my program, for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little, as if okamura tschechien should save.
I am not a savior.
I know that I alone nothing faciliti; that is why I have discussed this with several celebrities, if you do not want to run for the Senate.
I have, for example with radim jančura spoken, but because arbeitsüberlastung refused.
I also have the investigative journalist Jana lorencová supports, the fraud in the trade with light fuel oil aufdeckte.
My candidacy, I began with the condition that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty per cent of voters are not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
We are only two independent in the Senate.
The people have chosen such a senatszusammensetzung that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example for the direct election of Mayors and bezirkshauptmänner.
Do you think about setting up a separate party after?
I have not thought about this, because I don't have time to review the past each potentiellen parteimitglieds, and certainly do not have the money.
I do not even have money for the präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account are only 20,000 kč.
You have no money?
You talk about vermögenserklärungen, how would your?
My wealth I appreciate to about 60 million kč.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a\ xC5 kodu superb, which is worth about one million. And then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was also a kindertraum - James Bond has always appealed to me, as he was in the car drove to women galant and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that they want to change the Republic, but their own money you do not want to invest in it.
This is not particularly convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make about debt?
I have 2.5 million put into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is probably not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to the campaign from its own resources to deny.
The cost of the campaign will basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senatorengehalt I could not live alone, so I could for my son not the English school finance costs, the 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
You're still continue to work as entrepreneurs, to have their livelihoods?
Not, you said that these activities will be back?
But this is not linked to the level of the salary.
As promised, I have my activities partially reduced.
For example, my deputy managing director of the travel agencies in the spring.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan, the Republic of rettet.
But I must but also of something life.
Which monthly income, they were used as an entrepreneur?
Around 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still so.
As President, I would my activities quite einstellen.
