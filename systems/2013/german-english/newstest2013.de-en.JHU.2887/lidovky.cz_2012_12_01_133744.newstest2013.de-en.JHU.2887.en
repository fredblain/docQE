The film ARGO: when it's at its worst, Hollywood anrufen
In November 1979 besetzte a mob demonstrierender Islamist students the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
for their release they requested the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades was the patronage of his regime had maintained.
For the American Government, there was no positive way out of this situation - they could not afford the Shah jettison, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time she was not in a position to in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent disaster at the violent attempt the geiselbefreiung made it even worse.
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian Government had been.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods hervor.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat by Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film ARGO of the film director and actor Ben affleck describes an episode of this story, the US a small teilsieg bescherte.
Just before the occupation of the message, six botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to bring the refugees from Iran; helped them an extravagant story to covering their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a drehorte filmstabes allegedly in the country for a science-fiction-film besuchte.
Of the genres
The plan developed by experts for "exfiltration," Tony Mendez, also made the cooperation Hollywood needed.
So the camouflage was credible, erschienen article about this film in peer-reviewed journals, press conferences have been held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
afflecks film is a special combination of several filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic politthriller, but at the same time, a so-called "caper movie," i.e., the story of a successful husarenstücks such as the film ocean's eleven.
This change in the movie The stimmungsebenen - on the one hand, the dokumentarszenen from Tehran (iconic contemporary photographs shown in the title sequence, and there are no major differences in the filmfassung the same situations).
On the other hand the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and slightly überspitzt therefore come.
And then there are the scenes from the cia-zentrale and other institutions - men in suits on besprechungstisch amtsfluren, on the phone...
Ben affleck is a remarkable reboot his career with this film succeeded.
From a belächelten actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
ARGO his third feature film after the crime is not easy (gone baby gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is afflecks first film, not in the local Boston plays the director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place it was one of the features that the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood abhoben.
affleck proves this sense but also in ARGO, where Tehran of Canada "played".
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - indeed the eingangssequenz the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, and it gives the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that comes when moving somewhere even history.
affleck and his team achieved a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong filmstab at a bazaar in Tehran).
act in too many places too much
The director also had to deal with that, that history is not many offers exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
He works with the little but it quite successfully, and sometimes a bit of reality nachhilft - and then not always seems so elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America is averted, or even the chase on the runway, looked a bit curious).
The weakness of ARGO is his too widely-dispersed range, which is limited by the need to show too much in action in too many places.
Alan arkin and John Goodman is very charming, but their characters have more space in their roles as hollywood-mitarbeiter deserves, and that they are in the film is far from alone.
afflecks film loses it a little traction. It is a film that we watch with some interest and in the design and a thriller from the 70 years erinnernden retro-stil goutieren can.
enthusiasm, it is difficult.
Until now as a reminder of a living piece of history in some way and as evidence of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, however, he is sufficient.
