In the last few days there was massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants across the United States popular fast food chains such as MC Donald's, Burger King, Wendy's, taco bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether you will soon be back to the air out.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to the increase of modest wages of simple walmart- and fast-food-beschäftigten the organizers of the protests aim to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly gewerkschaftlich organisiert.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, in the ausverkäufe took place in the US, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes led to handgemengen.
On this day, some walmart-mitarbeiter, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, your work down and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branch of the chain, which targets individuals are low and middle income.
Walmart sold all products, from diapers on hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the walmart-filialen is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why buy many of the slightly paid walmart-beschäftigten only at the workplace.
The prices and the warensortiment machten Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart the goods often sell only so cheap, because the staff are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of serious conditions, for example lack of trucks or handscanner.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases, and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution for the company health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical walmart-mitarbeiter, 9.5\ xC2$ deserves the hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company's wage increases on 12\ xC2 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
There are about 1.1% more than they now pay donations.
Walmart wage increases would fully applies to the customers, kostete every purchase they only 46 cents more in the future.
per year would be the extra expenditure of just 12,39 dollars for them compared to today.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only to protests in nine States and that the company no losses bescherten.
The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, and the next day in this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the walmart-kassen on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan fogelman, said in an interview on the website of left-wing huffington post that a "less than five" walmart-mitarbeiter the work niederlegten only "another PR stunt" and the action of the trade unions, which organised the protests that had happened.
"free cash!"
The protests went further in New York this week, where their goal but not walmart-filialen (which are not wanted in this progressive city and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and others were cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billion portions, and yet you, no krankentage, and you will be granted for your honest work not paid.

At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation in 7,25 dollars an hour.
In fast-food-restaurants will gradually raised the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York 8,90 dollars an hour.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's was behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.
No one was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that they have to make do with this reward and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there are the forum a comment to the newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the 40th street and Madison avenue began, demanded that the cashier and chefs of fast-food-restaurants received a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They further demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food-branche.
The US law prohibits it standing in the way of corporate governance, this objective and gewerkschaftsmitglieder abzumahnen or dismiss.
On the other hand, makes the governance you not easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food-branche is difficult but also for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
unhappy
noisy protests there was on this day, many other fast food options in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local democrats languages including stadtratsmitglied jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billion portions, and yet you, no krankentage, and you will be granted for your honest work not paid!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, bürgermeisterkandidat bill de blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food-mitarbeiter together so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, every New York deserves."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food-industrie.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, far from all of them employed in the fast-food-branche are in the tens of thousands of work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses.
