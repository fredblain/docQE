The most difficult job in the world: the human arbeitstiere of kawah ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they bear 70 kilos of sulfur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work hell is, and other work literally in hell.
This is the case with anto wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by visiting sulphur from the volcano kawah ijen get in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He needs every day down on the floor of this crater, where the rise from the Earth ausströmende verfestigt sulphuric gas in contact with the air.
After he has extracted large schwefelsteine, the total can weigh up to 70 pounds, transported it in two bambuskörben further down on his shoulders on the stone paths.
There are just 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted träger need more than 40 minutes for the rise in schildkrötentempo, and you have to put the balance and keep their steps carefully so they do not slip and crash.
You know that every step you can cost lives, as a French tourist happened years ago on the slopes of the kawah ijen abstürzte.
The miner of kawah ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur, reduce it.
Once at the top, as they are the way between the tourists who like zirkusaffen photograph them and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to balance that has drawn up a minengesellschaft a little further down a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT candi ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (never better) exploiting its workers which they said 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulphur is charged.
It sold them for every 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widespread and for the production of streichhölzern feuerwerksartikeln, cosmetics, dynamite and even the pale of sugar is used.
"Because we usually carry 70 kg, we get for each way about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," explains makes us anto normally three routes on the day.
For every track it needs three hours that he has managed, at the end of the day, but he then 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserabler pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times what he would earn with the land.
"The tagelohn minenarbeiter here, where the kaffeeernte 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day will be paid and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, which previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but anto has returned with his family to banyuwangi, a village near, and that for a reason, which is so important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are hinduisten, you and I have brought to Java to convert them to Islam."
anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, hustet often and his eyes are due to toxic gases irritated.
The 27 year old anto continues his life for three years on the kawah ijen risk, sulfur in it already has made the first mark, although he covers his face with a mask and spezialbrille.
anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, hustet frequently and his eyes are due to toxic gases from the volcano irritated.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work even two years here, because I have a store open up or would like to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This friendly and intelligent, but the life gestrafte young man could be a tourist guide, waiters or working at the front desk of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a tragesels.
He shares a dirty holzhütte with other agencies and stands at two o'clock every morning in sulphur, because even at night ausströmt, where his characteristic yellow color bläulich shines in the darkness.
The shadow challenging, it rises in the light of a small stirnlampe on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money, in the crater.
About 400 agencies can download the kraterboden baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their large profits, the minengesellschaft schwefelabbau not mechanized, in order to save costs, and provides the agencies who work on their own account and be paid according to weight, no equipment.
You also get no benefit from the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of EUR 15,000 rupees (1.2) demand of the tourists who come to take photos of the volcano and human tragesel.
"This work is not for the animals and for people" protestiert madrusin, a stämmiger, 42 years old carrier, the three decades since leaving the school at kawah ijen works.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continue," as long as it is," because he needs the money for the education of his three children, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and eyes itch when the wind suddenly turns and the miner in the thick pillars einklemmt, the rising from the crater, the men are so tough that no one about serious diseases klagt... of course, apart from the usual atemproblemen, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which have become warped by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back is unainik with its 53 years is in a position to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, the three trucks on a ziegenpfad between the brush to camp in tamansari be transported in 18 miles away.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," explains unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth.
By his five children, the oldest of his 30 years as schwefel-träger.
Time passes, but the armseligkeit hält generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: the who as human lastesel on kawah ijen work.
