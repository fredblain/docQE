Mexico's Enrique pena nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico's incoming President Enrique pena nieto prepared for his office, analyzed will grant from the BBC the challenges facing him and the mixed emotions of his people.
The traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is a congested city, but on Monday it was always a ring of steel errichtet, several key verkehrsrouten absperrt in the capital and causing chaos on the streets.
The goal, it was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from Parliament to achieve.
On Saturday, Mexico's New President Enrique pena held the präsidentenbinde received and the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe calderons, Mexico can work well economically, but the country is in the grip of a drogenkriegs, which already has claimed 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My Government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," said pena held earlier this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he went on an equal footing with the US President, was pena held as Governor of his heimatstaats Mexico tätig.
In this densely populated, large part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the divided opinions about the new head of state.
A direct Man
In the remote town of Valle del bravo they remember, for example, like to him.
Residents of the resort of write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to achieve the city, you can go on one of the highways, the pena nieto build, and are a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that were here once.

"We expect him real and lasting changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel pena nietos olvera Hernandez, a congressman for the party, the PRI works.
In particular, with regard to the security and economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 replaced by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside of the Los pinos präsidentenpalasts great expectations of Enrique pena held.
Accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct person, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state not many people share that view of their former governor.
In association, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the Community are of crucial urban nature.
The beginning of this year, the military was switched to the drug gangs operating in the districts, and to combat violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spots brachland near a large mülldeponie were left alone in the last two years the bodies of dozens of murders of women.

There were signs that they had been beaten, and the leichenstarre had already used.
While their mother tells their story, looks from the Wall a picture of Mariana down on us. It is next to a cross angebracht that wears a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, have been denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me, as if I a schwätzerin, unruhestifterin, nörglerin.

If President pena held on Saturday the präsidentenbinde receives, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime in the last six years, and the new President has promised during his term of office, particularly to deal with this problem.
"I hope that as President, he is as he was as Governor," says the pri-kongressabgeordnete olvera in Valle del bravo.
