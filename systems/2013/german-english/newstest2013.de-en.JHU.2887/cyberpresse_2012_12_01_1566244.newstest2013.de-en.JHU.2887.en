The higgs-boson analysed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the higgs-bosons has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
We believe in fact that this boson in nothing less than the mechanism is involved, who is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And it is, after all, the last particle whose existence from the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter - predicted, but empirically has not been observed.
But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the standard model predicted higgs-boson strongly resembles.
Moreover, that seems to be confirmed by new data that were presented this week on a large physik-kongress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to agree to be completely safe.
Nevertheless, we expect that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently there is a low risk to deceive, and we take a look at what it is about.
In this world there is a necessarily unumg√§ngliches law meant that two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to break this rule - and try not to strong, because they will hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they also such a law, the Pauli'sche ausschlussprinzip that says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, when they are in the same "quantenzustand" and the "state" largely consists of some of its properties.
On that basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, which are called fermione and artig obey the pauli-prinzip.
And in another move the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, which nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they are in fact in the same place at the same time.
The particle adventure these bosons are grouped according to the website of the BERKELEY laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the mesonen, which we will not deal with here and the "kraftteilchen spread," by the great forces of nature and with which the higgs-boson somehow would be used.
It has to be stressed, however, that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are, as expected.
If you are able to read these chronik, then only thanks to a bosons uitzonderlijke banality: the photon, or the "lichtteilchen," which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge up or change the direction," disrupted "the electromagnetic field that is in this place, like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" is an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolettstrahlung etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "carrier of the force."
stabileres field
The same applies to the higgs-boson, with the difference that a different field, the higgs-feld, must be "disturbed" so that this boson shows.
However, the higgs-feld much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, its surface only by a very large rock zerfurcht could be.
A giant particle accelerator as CERN is therefore necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all of the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never think of themselves on the fridge.
And not all particles interact with the same higgs-feld: those who do, have a mass, while the other (as, incidentally, the photon) have no mass.
For what all this research now "may well be" asks Mrs plamondon?
For the science they serve the review of the standardmodells (sm), and also enable physicists to look closely at all the variations between the observations and predictions of sm.
There are also many physicists, the eagerly hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and the model plug some holes.
It has to be said that the latter is great shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the schwerkraft (ups!) and the dark matter, ups, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (again!).
However, the CERN derartige abweichungen not found until now.
impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the bell-laboren not suspected that their work would cause such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the bell labs in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) - said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a "laborspielerei".
Imagine...
applications also can also arise from all the instruments, surrounded the research.
For example, in turn, has Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the look a small light sensor developed.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras around the world today as "eye" and introduced him 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you really never know it can...
