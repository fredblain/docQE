"the great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While members and civil rights activist, discuss the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminal act already with fake certificates
Each year, 13 million workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which each arbeitsmigrant tells a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, drop it.
So far this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, the local housing and retail.
However, should the tests with time, according to federal migrationsbehörde in future for all workers to be compulsory.
In this context, we must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and to the foundations of the legislation.
sprachkenntnisse must both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit be proved.
exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is an official language.
also exempt from this legislation are people who have received their ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
sense, problems and protecting the rights
The whole of the prüfungsstellen, under the aegis of the puschkin-instituts for the Russian language, the Russian university völkerfreundschaft, of Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other universities are.
The migrants can store the tests in all the cities; already have already been more than 160 entsprechende centers opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal migrationsbehörde.
civil rights activist, stellten prior to the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: what is this all about?
What changes is the provision to sprachkenntnisse show, both for the Russians, as well as for guest workers?
Above all, counter the migrationsbehörde spokesman, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.
"many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the delegation of the federal migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor sebelew.
Their rights must be protected, however, before their departure.
Only organised rekrutierung will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical observation.
sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without sprachkenntnisse inevitably people with bad intentions, put it under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow building, where he will meet with dozens seinesgleichen months without food and documents will endure schuften and 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"in the home, you will be the one promised, and on arrival you cheated to get their passports taken and not receive the promised reward," confirms the head of the headquarters for migration of the Tajik migrationsbehörde tolib schwaripow.
not complaining, boss!
Yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia want to earn their money, that they not only do not speak the language of the country, but also can hardly express in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not your fault, so much as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks, can also make a sensible primary education.
Because there are not even money to feed the children in their families, let alone to buy them a decent clothes, shoes and schulsachen.
As a teenager take these children then the first opportunity to making money. immediately
"It is difficult without sprachkenntnisse," you are.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Human rights activists say on the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status for.
You have this status not, so there is no investigation and, therefore, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
banned "welcome" or "access for unauthorized"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain in Russia, an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Also the legalisierung costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Make a fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents largely gefaelscht and we are not registered, and it will create cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," is the tadschike umed huschkadamow to journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers"
Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates, the completion of the sprachtests bescheinigen, have already been by employees of the federal migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.
The fake papers were printed with a normal color.
Of course, the new owners this not in vain: every migrant who hoped to be able to save as the tests, paid for the document siebentausend rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost for the official review: this costs a arbeitsmigranten three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and civil rights activist agree.
For the moment the authorities can immigrant workers covered by the test for the first time, only promise that you get time for a sprachgrundkurs.
In addition, newcomers without sprachkenntnisse posts in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
