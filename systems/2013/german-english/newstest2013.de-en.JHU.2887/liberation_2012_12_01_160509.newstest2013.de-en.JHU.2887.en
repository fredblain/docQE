A constitution with the brechstange in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed mursi.
While Egypt in terms of the verfassungserklärung it temporarily the unlimited authority granted remains divided, more than ever, he has decided to go for broke.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day his final version.
Just a week ago, the Head of State this House granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work.
Egypt is now for nearly two years based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only provided for an even stronger divisions in the country.
For his opponents remains the President in his "autocratic delirium," adding he continued "breaks his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the side of his supporters assured you that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
within 14 days should a referendum will be held.
A very short period of time, which is forcing the brothers to abandon their plan, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.
It is also a way for the President, his public and democratic legitimacy of action during the protest raging across the country.
After bekräftigungen in an interview with the American wochenschau time seems to be Mohammed mursi convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Especially as the Egyptian people vote with this recourse to a hasty vote will put an ultimatum: "Either you for my draft or I keep the unlimited power," the latter should supposedly put an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals is not fulfilled the request.
Shortly before the verfassungserklärung mid November, they have turned away, as they are of the opinion that they have not been able to bring to bear, their views.
representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or the civil society have acted similarly.
To reach the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, deputy Members, added.
Some are the moslembrüdern retentie.
It is not surprising that the article meistens adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining, incidentally, that the only difference of the day... in the time for prayer is expressed, as some members of the board were of the opinion that the grandfather clock, the constituent assembly was not exactly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, paragraph 2, drew all the attention, is identical to that of the constitution of 1971 and says that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The salafistischen parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace "the principles" by "the rules", which would have made a stronger application possible.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of its good intentions and for your respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy" say the Liberals, who see this only as propagandaschlag.
Because, according to them, is the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items.
You have particularly Article 220 zuerkennt a consultative role in the eye, of the University of al-Azhar, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the ägyptenspezialistin Sophie pommier this is worrying, because "the people who have been asked for an opinion, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see that the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals will also fed by the fact that the next rector of the university will be much less moderate than the current.
"there is currently no specific religious commitment to recognize.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, are not ulema, but scholars who have been trained to become part of the French system," Alexis blouet appeased, the writing a thesis about the Egyptian verfassungstransition.
He but acknowledges that "in relation to the Article 220 can have a ambiguity, because the terms used the religious vocabulary are based.
It relates in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, shops. red.].
And in the future could be raised the question to what extent zivilrichter are competent to decide."
In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday strongly criticised because of the far-reaching powers, which he granted the President of the Republic.
The moslembrüder argue that these are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military is the examination of the defense budget not presented to Parliament, but a National Defence Council.
As there will be no ban on civil cases in military courts, as the associations have called for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text with you as the freiheitsbedrohend ansehen.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, and could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Furthermore, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines heba morayef by Human Rights Watch.
Your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the Head of State will be Saturday aufmarschieren.
