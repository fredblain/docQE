<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy in order to counter the re-election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat, the electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the latter Brennan Center for a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the US, moreover, only 300 cases of fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to Canada are the States for the implementation of the elections in the individual States.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, the new laws announced the procedure for the registration or the ballot.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has, after the elections in November 2010 grown in importance, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries could be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, 180 draft laws alone were introduced in the year 2011, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new electoral laws demand that the voters and proof of a Lichtbildausweis US-Staatsbürgerschaft.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, these laws also the periods for the early vote shortened, the right declared invalid, on the day, to register as voters and citizens of the right to vote, for which a Gerichtsakte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006, no US State of the voters asked to produce a Lichtbildausweis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first federal state, of such a request.</seg>
<seg id="15">The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities rushed, this practice to other States.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the last two years, encouraged in 34 States draft legislation, with which the voters are forced to produce a Lichtbildausweis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that the US in contrast to Quebec not on a universal cards as the health card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of US citizens have, i.e. non-German 21 million people do not of a governmental authority of their state Lichtbildausweis issued.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012, not on such a card.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay the necessary card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes disproportionately affected.</seg>
<seg id="23">Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years, not on the necessary Lichtbildausweis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This goes further.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, be regarded as the electorate that their voice more for democratic candidates, it is not permitted in several countries, their Lichtbildausweis issued to use its establishment.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, these same States allow members of Angel- or Jagdvereinen, the more for the Republican side to choose which of these associations cards issued for elections to be used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, has no state for the rational proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first federal state, of such a request.</seg>
<seg id="29">For 2011 have a dozen countries, the laws adopted by the voters demand that they demonstrate their US-Staatsbürgerschaft.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly, to limit the Hispanic votes.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, the Republican legislators 2011 in eight States laws, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, you have the right of individuals and groups, those voters limited to assist the wish to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, the campaigns to electoral registration in the general elections in 2004 helped, around 10 million citizens to register.</seg>
<seg id="36">Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 to 17%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Furthermore, the Republican legislators in another five States adopted legislation aimed at the period for the early vote.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though it is only 13% of the voters of the federal state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same applies to the Hispanic population.</seg>
<seg id="40">The latter, only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who have elected in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of voters who elected in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws, the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several proposals have been through the vetoes of the democratic governors blocked.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Advocate-General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">They could limit the damage caused in part.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of the 34 States have adopted legislation, which just a Lichtbildausweises demand.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the new rules introduced in the year 2012, without doubt, the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The democratic critics point the party political nature of the laws passed on and to see them as a clear objective of the influence of the results in the crucial States for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the centres of 2011 Brennan shows that those States that these laws have adopted, 171 of 270 votes, in the Electoral College are needed to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to with certainty to confirm that these changes to the legislation on electoral system, a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the test should be made or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The PSA-Test, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, but also with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">This leads to greater hesitation the already undecided men for the implementation of Früherkennungstests.</seg>
<seg id="4">The test should be made or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have sought the opinion of two consultant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies conducted in the United States were many disruptors between the control, so that it is difficult to interpret these data and clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">A further study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study has also shown that, when Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of the likelihood of the education of metastases 30 to 40% higher, if no screening has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, when one has a direct relatives to prostate cancer, which was already ill.</seg>
<seg id="10">In men afro-amerikanischer origin is also a higher risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The most important thing is to take the right decision, as soon as a cancer was recognised.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are cancers, the aggressive and others, the indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient must the scale of the risk of its cancer really understandable, be made by him the possible options, which remain untouched Prostatakrebse can, if he the quality of life in the long term, and it is not affected in these cases for a more active monitoring of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, will take place in many men, in which it has not recognised, cancer treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and not a threat to their lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">It proposes them an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">We certainly with greater accuracy the criteria for a decision, who should be dealt with and who does not.</seg>
<seg id="17">I therefore recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.</seg>
<seg id="18">The most important, but it is to speak with his doctor in order to determine whether it should be carried out or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the international society for Urologie Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible, the advantages and disadvantages of the widespread PSA testing.</seg>

<seg id="21">Prevention of disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle the best way, in order to reduce the risk, to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all good enough to eat and would move.</seg>
<seg id="25">'If there is no smokers more, this value at least 50% increase, "stresses André Beaulieu, the spokesperson of the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several remain completely unresolved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It damages the health of people.</seg>
<seg id="32">'Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers' regrets the spokesman of André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In accordance with the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity-related health issues also promote the outbreak of disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">They seem the risk for breast, Grimmdarm-, Mastdarm- Speiseröhren- Bauchspeicheldrüsen-, to increase, and cervical cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">'The research shows that a regular physical activity during the whole life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects', he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The diet</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organisation also recommends, the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In too great deal, it increases the risk of a Grimm- or Mastdarmkrebs to become ill.</seg>
<seg id="41">Sausages should also be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of meat civilization once lived quite hygienically by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the education of carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="43">'the latter can damage the cells and the development of cancer, "he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years have a number of scientists the connection between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">But their studies are currently not conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Canadian Krebsgesellschaft are the studies to vitamin E contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While a study which reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, showed a different rather an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of Vitamin D on the cancer has also not yet made quite clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is, with his doctor of its concerns and his family down to speak.</seg>
<seg id="51">'The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer'.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The analyses Higgs-Boson</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs-Bosons last summer, a certain degree of attention, and for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">We believe that in fact, this Boson to nothing less than the mechanism is involved, for the mass of objects in the universe is responsible.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lastly, it is the last particles, whose existence of the Standard Model - our best or 'least false' statement by the nature and the behaviour of the matter - predicted empirically, but not yet been observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physicist, it is still not entirely sure that it really the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without a shadow of doubt that we have a genuine new particles, and that the predicted Higgs-Boson greatly resembles the Standard Model.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data in this week on a large Physik-Kongress were presented in Kyoto, but it still lacking data, in order to be completely safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">We nevertheless believe that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a minimal risk, to deceive, and we are looking at what is at stake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is in this world a necessarily inescapable law, which means that two objects not at the same time, there can be the same place.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not possible, against this rule - and you are trying to break it is not too much, as you will hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Because even if the particle physics a truly strange world is, turns out that it also such a law applies: the Pauli Clausewitzian Ausschlussprinzip, which says that two particles not the same room at the same time, if they can fill in the same 'Quantenzustand', and this' state 'by and large from some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">On this basis, the physicist share the particles in two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a corner of the good citizens, be described as Fermione and lastly the Pauli principles.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in the other the Bosonen a vile, gang of anarchists, which nothing is sacred - not in any case this principle, which means that they are in fact, at the same time on the same place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These Bosonen is in accordance with the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen we are not be discussing and the 'Kraftteilchen', by the major forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson somehow be used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">There must be emphasised, however, that these Bosonen not all such exotic creatures are, as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the Photon or the 'Lichtteilchen', that of 'messenger' of electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">Indeed, when a particle speeded up with an electrical goods or the direction of change, the electromagnetic fields precisely in this place 'disrupted', such as a pebble that has been thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">By this' disturbance 'is an electromagnetic wave (light Infrarot- or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon Bosonen and therefore one of the "bearer of force'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another area that Higgs-Feld must be ',' disrupted, so that this Boson shows.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Higgs-Feld very much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the pathogens must achieve very high energy, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks zerfurcht.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger like CERN necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic fields is again helpful in the relationship between the Higgs and the mass to explain.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic fields.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, do this, but not others - a piece of paper, for example, would never even in the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">Not all particles and equally interact with the Higgs-Feld: those that do have a mass, while the other (as the Photon) no mass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For what can all these research now be 'good' asks Mrs Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they will enable the physicists also, all the differences between the observations and the predictions of SM carefully to examine.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are also numerous physicist, the truly hope that such derogations to be found, since the slightest difference a door to a 'new physics' open and some of the model could fill holes.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must say that the latter still major shortcomings, since there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which provides approximately 80% of the matter of the universe (once again ups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">However, when CERN such derogations until now not been found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.</seg>
<seg id="35">Incidentally, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell-Laboren not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle - which has worked in the Bell Labs, where lasers in the 1960 ’ s was invented the 1962, and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) has developed - already said that the lasers at the beginning, rather than a 'Laborspielerei'.</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Moreover, can also applications from all the instruments which surrounded the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">Willard Boyle 1969, in turn, has, for example, during its work in the optics a small Lichtsensor developed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it was not the original purpose, the purpose of this sensor today all digital cameras in the world as' an eye and has he 2009 the Nobel Prize in Physics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC necessarily change our lives, but it means that it really can never know...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care - the best way to die | Le Devoir...</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">With its Committee on 'death in Quebec dignity' has recently the sensitive issue of Lebensendes discussed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate will soon have to be resumed, although a draft law is being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, in this important area still much to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir has tried, to look as this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago lived Mr L. still alone in his home in the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate cancer, the aufzehrte him, he had a period of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">'You gave me five years to live, I have managed to seven years', he said, half-hearted, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">'But, it is always a shock, which is something we can not be prepared for', he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease is doing its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents any alone to use the toilet and even to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the table a delicious lunch, he resigned itself to do, at the Essen to help.</seg>
<seg id="12">Courageous he manages to smile and even to talk to strangers, which employs around him, his medicine, and a bad.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">'My greatest hope is that one of my diarrhea, because that is humiliating cure', does he share with.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team a cure for this evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'In the course of our lives, we learn that a man on pinkelt', a psychologist told Pierre Brodeur Victor-Gadbois in the home.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Kindheitsphase is for certain persons to return to an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">'The depends on the ability of the person', a step backwards, he notes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because, in view of several people who work in the palliative care, major events in the midst of this step backwards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois be trained, are all suffering from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, they will of the doctors and nurses, who look after them, not more with so-called 'curative' care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, 'deliberately and by suffocation' to die.</seg>
<seg id="24">But by the disease, I have really got to know my children.</seg>
<seg id="25">'I have good children', she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">'I have no requests more in the life', it says, before they accepted that it is a mask aufsetzt, it helps to breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">It expects the next few days in a recent visit of her son, from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the home Victor-Gadbois provides it with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in the food.</seg>
<seg id="29">The palliative care will be used if there is no other means.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to make the deaths of more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec is to state for the inhabitants of a bed palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is very little, if one takes into account that one day we all will die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">This is the continued life in the best possible conditions, Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of homes.</seg>
<seg id="34">Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual own comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">It grants the dying according to the desire a Mundpflege with brandy or Pepsi.</seg>
<seg id="36">The diabetics must no longer control their Blutzuckerspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening we have Mr X a beer, served in the course of the night has died.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning will be son the beer at the feet of the deceased austrinken.</seg>
<seg id="40">'We help patients' families and equally, reported Pflegedirektorin Nathalie Savard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the home Victor-Gadbois is not a day as the other.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition to an old man from 93 years, the last Familienzusammenkunft in the Court and good of his Kopfkissen, while opening up to its honour of a young man of 36 years of his parents, his wife and two small children is surrounded, tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">'For six months are three to five beds always with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years proves' shares Dr Christiane Martel concerned with.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of patients admitted into the homes Victor-Gadbois come from their Wohnstätte, 47% come from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It says that 77% of the Canadians have no access to palliative care, in other words a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organisations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the society for domestic palliative care of the Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is precisely this major shortcoming in the healthcare Quebec ensures that several of them in the palliative care specialist doctors the adoption of a law regulating of euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with reservations.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent personalities of palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Doctor Bernard Lapointe signed to their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">Dr Christiane Martel Quebec, according to the health system is not effective enough, in order to ensure that all the right to a high-quality palliative care, before we have accepted, on euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, it says that I have seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room was, without that it has taken measures to alleviate.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And, at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst predictions stubbornly to the last day.</seg>
<seg id="54">The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as it is an onerous chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I told my Onkologin that I will stop the treatment, it has replied that they regret that the fight, told they please.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, they told me that I was at the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No omnipotente care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, to thank the staff that it has not granted this desire, after their pain of a team of palliative care have been mitigated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it must be clearly stated that the palliative care in the Schmerzbehandlung is not omnipotent.</seg>
<seg id="60">After Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Greater Montreal 8% of patients do not speak on a Schmerzbehandlung.</seg>
<seg id="61">At the very end of life, the doctors so often the terminale Sedierung, which amounts to the patient either sporadically or permanently einzuschläfern by the time of his death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We can no longer act as if we do not accept this side of the suffering.</seg>

<seg id="5">The scandal was it due to a thorough investigation of embezzlement in connection with the Treaties to Straßenbauarbeiten revealed in Quebec, of the then Prime Minister only reluctantly agreed to.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 'Duchesneau-Bericht' established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and corruption of officials.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="12">In recent weeks it has made with a whole series of raids and accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials like Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, particularly from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is suspected of, in exchange for public contracts to have repeatedly taken bribes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, explicitly accused of engineers of the Montreal Straßenbauamts, and entrepreneurs Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The latter has a sensation, by providing the Commission the operation of the 'system' for the preservation of public contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">He himself has several years of 3% of the value of the Treaties in Montreal received a with the Mafia intermediaries, the money paid to the Union Montreal, the party of mayors Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr Zambito everywhere in the 2000 ’ s had its hand in it by more than 88 000 Canadian dollar (around EUR 68) Provinzparteien, especially at the time in power gewesenen Liberals.</seg>
<seg id="19">He also acknowledged, an illegal funds for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau to have organised.</seg>

<seg id="21">In Montreal, the 'system' of the corruption smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="22">The former a civil engineer Gilles Surprenant this before the Commission has described in detail: in ten years, he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, Golf-Turnieren, restaurants and Eishockey-Spielen, and in tune of $736.000 bribes in return for Kanalisationsverträge, whose cost it artificially.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials of the Straßenbauamtes have admitted that it is insuring by the accounts with false additional artificially aufblähten to 30-40%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreover, a organisers of the Party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay that he accused of deliberately on a shadow budget has overlooked, of its coffers with black filled.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of these revelations is Mr Tremblay at the beginning of November, which resigned Montreal in a serious crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Members of Montreal, the alarm.</seg>

<seg id="30">She says that the procedure 'painful, but positive'.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are in the wound up, however, one need only for Montreal certain fraud investigation unit, and a supervision, with a return of the questionable practices.</seg>
<seg id="32">How clean.</seg>
<seg id="33">On a regular basis.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">'PSG is not the Barcelona!'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season PSG have you with a new scale.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">It cannot by a personal view, but also by the new dimension of the PSG explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Great players are.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day, I am making progress on their side.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff has also given a lot to me.</seg>
<seg id="8">These elements spur me to my Spielniveau on a daily basis, to improve.</seg>
<seg id="9">And in a game, this is even easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football is all very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not breche in enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my origins in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my Spielzeit in gradually Saint-Etienne I have always made progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">They are thus the advantage of by Carlo Ancelotti competition introduced...</seg>
<seg id="14">The new entrants of this summer are accustomed, Games very high level.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that any Trainingseinheit is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">This means that a player, as I have to stand up to and want to give its best.</seg>
<seg id="17">Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti much in relation to my Spielposition.</seg>
<seg id="18">It will be supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele, on the same position as I was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the right person for the task?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti instills all the technicians respect.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and it is the best coaches of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has a rich experience and has many title with prestigious clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He had contact with major players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that it will gain further title in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I have an encouraging talk with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, I have just recovered from a Verletzungsserie.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation of my services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Ligue 1 has Lyon Spitzenreiters the place of us.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we lurk in ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our most important objectives is the Champions League: we have in this way to the final 8 qualified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the objective of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try, as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">We will, however, against a very good European teams have our say.</seg>
<seg id="37">Firstly, we want first of our group in Porto, so that we return leg of the Achtelfinales out as does best.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can the PSG in the short term, a great European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">He has already the budget for...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to be a great European club, Paris title must win a name and long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is not the case today.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially is the PSG the funds, so that this project takes concrete forms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">It would be a great failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to gain, as in the last season was the case?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, this would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year, it is really to cream off this title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season, we were close off.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we were disappointed, because we have been strong enough to the victory.</seg>
<seg id="48">We have the season with a very strong performance closed.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have concluded with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">We should normally be master with 79 points...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">I believe that this year is the right.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams like Marseilles, Lyon or Bordeaux the title, I believe that we have the stuff to him to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media to expect much from PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">In view of what has been invested and the players, we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accept the perfect.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, if we in a does best against Troyes 4-0 gain, and we still find something to what we can accuse us of this is certainly somewhat frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what the people expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We could never win with 4-0 every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not of the Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to establish a Spielkonzept.</seg>
<seg id="62">Building a team with the time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League, we have shown strength.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, not to qualify for the final 8, and which also has huge expenditure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the sums invested believed you to time out with 15 points ahead!</seg>
<seg id="66">This would mean that our opponents and the French championship ignored.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, the last season were not well, this new PSG 'geboostet'.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we in the month of May the smiling will be winners and tell us that we finally, despite all the difficulties they have won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems completely from the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be dependent on.</seg>
<seg id="71">In order better to be a 'Zlatan-Abhängigkeit'.</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">That is why it is, and it shows that he is the star the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever he has played, he has shown that it is a great players and a world star with respect.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the team, we respect both the players and the person.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respected the people who surround him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done, is exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This encourages others, to improve their Spielniveau.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, the world is one of the best defenders, it allows all others also to make progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you have the Euro 2012 seen with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">I wanted to participate in the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my violation prevented from something obscene Spielzeit.</seg>
<seg id="84">I have seen things there emerged strengthened from which I am.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, I am, good Games in the national team.</seg>
<seg id="86">This was since my baptism with the 'Bleus' my hope.</seg>
<seg id="87">From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learnt our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What are your views to the first few months by Didier Deschamps at the top of the 'Bleus'?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He has promising results achieved.</seg>
<seg id="90">We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">The coaches is strictly, is close to the players and encourages the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">As it was also Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would like to no comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had achieved its objective, by giving us for Euro qualified.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that the 'Bleus Didier Deschamps' to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Is that on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1: 1) a Auftaktspiel?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game has given us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Everyone has for all the other.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before this meeting in Spain, I have never been a comparable game in my career.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and administrative fees between the parties involved.</seg>

<seg id="4">That is indeed of Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) trumped-up Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in the dollar, euro, etc., convertible) and a protocol for the safe exchange as BitTorrent, the direct exchange of files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With 15 000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">A few thousand Web sites Bitcoin accept as donation or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 a high of $30 (23 euro), five months later he fell to $2 today, before he has recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing particularly impressive in comparison with the world trade from real currencies or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown for this.</seg>
<seg id="10">It describes Bitcoin as' the virtual currency with the greatest success', 'in competition with the dollar or the euro' and 'similar to the conventional currencies'.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the 'bill' that will be used to make progress in a video game that we gain by Games, or buy (and sometimes zurücktauschen).</seg>

<seg id="12">The social networking site Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="13">Every time, however, the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.</seg>
<seg id="14">With Bitcoin are all Netzknoten Rechnungsbuchs repositories of the same time, Auditors, Geld-Emittenten and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So what does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users will take place in reality, between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the difference that the user to pay for any other, can choose what the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A number of this operation in connection with the data will be signed electronically by a double cypher system.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this way can the network of the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">By means of the content of the database, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the whole network widespread Rechnungsbuch of public accounts are there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The decisive step is that this new transaction in this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is happening on a mathematical task, which will be launched on computers, with the winners, a kind of preliminary Zentralbankier, has the privilege, this additional line to add.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a Zerstückeln the file, i.e. transforming a major file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprinting.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computer 'take' the new transaction and do it in a number, before the whole 'zerhackt'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim is, the number to find a special fingerprint (many zeros) at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="26">If this figure has been found, the other knot can easily examine whether it is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is in the long term with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user to cheat two time very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay, would only one of the two transactions to be validated by the network and the other if there is no link, as both different fingerprints.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network has already had ups and downs.</seg>

<seg id="1">A constitution, with the way in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a new game of poker of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily the unlimited power granted to him, more than ever, remains divided, it decided to put everything on a card.</seg>
<seg id="4">To the surprise of all, he has announced that on Wednesday, the Constituent Assembly on the next day will adopt its final version.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week ago the head of state of this House had two more months to the conclusion of its work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Egypt is now for almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and to a legal confusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has only for an even greater division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For his opponents remains the President in his' autocratic Delirium ', by breaking it continues to be' word 'and' the right underfoot '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the part of his supporters can assure you that it is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period, which obliges the Brothers, on their projects, the Egyptians the text section for section to explain.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the President, it is also a way, its public and democratic legitimacy, during the protests throughout the country has been raging.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the contrary, in an interview with the American Wochenschau Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Given that the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote an ultimatum: 'Either agrees for my draft or I reserve the unlimited power', the latter should after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the Liberals is not done so.</seg>
<seg id="17">Just before the Constitutional Declaration in the middle of November they have averted, because they believe that they do not have been able to make their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities, or of civil society alike have acted.</seg>
<seg id="19">To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning in a hurry 11 people, deputy Members.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the Moslembrüdern.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprising that the Article usually have been adopted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">The commentators have found it amusing that the only difference of the day... in the late hour for the prayer expressed, because some Members of the body of the opinion that the Constituent Assembly Pendeluhr not exactly was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, is from 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2, which drew attention to all, finally, identical to that the 1971 constitution and says that 'the principles of the Sharia the main source of law'.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped, 'the principles' by the rules to replace ', which would have made a stronger application possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">'hypocrisy' say the Liberals, who only see this as Propagandaschlag.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because, according to them is the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They have in mind, particularly Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, particularly in relation to the review of the conformity with the laws of Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier this is worrying as' the people who are asked to give an opinion, have not been elected and any democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is this the first signs of a theocracy see '.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the Liberals will also be fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university much less than the current moderate should be.</seg>
<seg id="33">'The is no specific religious commitment to see.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">The majority of lawyers who have worked on this text, but are not ulema, academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, "Alexis Blouet appeased a thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.</seg>
<seg id="36">But he acknowledges that 'in relation to the Article 220 some ambiguity may be available, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">It relates in particular, on the 'fiqh' [Islamic jurisprudence, Anm. that Red.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future could be raised the question of to what extent Zivilrichter are competent to decide '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday greatly because of the far-reaching powers, which he criticised the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Moslembrüder argue that these compared with the former regime are reduced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another issue: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In line with the desire of the military the examination of the defence budget will not be presented to Parliament, but a national NDC.</seg>
<seg id="43">There will also no ban on civil in military courts, as the human rights associations have called for.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text with which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, and serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover, there is no article refers more to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">Their opinion, is the only positive point the prohibition of torture by Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not included in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian President yesterday evening on the television demonstrations had to speak, are planned for this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The supporters of the Head of State will March Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="8">The tests should, however, with the time Föderaler Migrationsbehörde in the future for all migrant workers to be compulsory.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this regard, we must not only language tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Language proficiency must both for the conservation and the extension of the work permit be demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is an official language.</seg>

<seg id="15">The migrants can the tests in all the cities to have already been in Russia; more than 160 appropriate centres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative for the introduction of the tests was of the Members of the State Duma and Federal Migrationsbehörde support.</seg>
<seg id="17">Civil rights activist, however, before the entry into force of the law on several occasions in the press the following question: what will the whole thing?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes does the rule, language skills to have to show, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all, however, the spokesman Migrationsbehörde is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.</seg>
<seg id="20">'For many now talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers,' says the head of the representation of the Federal Migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.</seg>
<seg id="21">Their rights must, however, already before departure be protected.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only an organised recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.</seg>
<seg id="23">Confronted with problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical assessment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without necessarily people with evil intentions of languages, which will tackle it under the pretext of aid in the dark, close shack, where he with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents persevere and 12 to 14 hours a day will exists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We receive many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">'In the country will give you the A promised, and the arrival of you will be deceived, have their passports and do not receive the promised pay', confirms the head of the headquarters for migration, the Tajik Migrationsbehörde Tolib Schwaripow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not complaining head!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who earn their money, not just that they do not speak the language of the country of destination, but also in their own language hardly in writing to express themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not their fault, but the evil: only a few Turkmens and Tajiks, Uzbeks, too, can only sensible primary education.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because in their families there is not yet even money to the children to feed them, let alone, proper clothing, footwear and Schulsachen to buy.</seg>
<seg id="31">These children as a teenager then immediately take the first opportunity for making money.</seg>
<seg id="32">'It is difficult without knowledge', to give them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You fühlst you humiliated and inferior. '</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Civil rights activist stress on the following important aspect of the law.</seg>
<seg id="35">The test must only migrants with legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">You do not have this status, there are no examination and therefore no official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">'Herzlich welcome' or 'Entry prohibited' for unauthorised</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many migrants confirm that it is not easy, in Russia, an official status.</seg>
<seg id="40">Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">It also costs the legalisation of money: 12 to 16 thousand ruble.</seg>
<seg id="42">A counterfeit registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The staff of the Russian police know that our documents largely fabricated and we are not registered, and it then cases of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="44">'you are one or two hundred ruble for cigarettes and tea', is the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">'merely no cost for false papers shy'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Already on the day on which the law came into force, it emerged that not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be forged.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some counterfeit certificates, which the completion of the language tests, have already been of staff of the Federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.</seg>
<seg id="48">The counterfeit documents were printed with an ordinary Farbdrucker.</seg>
<seg id="49">Naturally, the new owner this not in vain: every migrant who hoped that this will be able to save the tests, paid for the document thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">That is more than twice as much as the costs for the official test: this costs a migrant workers three thousand ruble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The fact that the most immediate task is, the system to protect against corruption, so that the certificates not simply can be bought, are both officials and civil rights activist agree.</seg>
<seg id="52">For the moment, the public authorities can immigrant workers, the first time by the test, only promise that it is time for a Sprachgrundkurs.</seg>
<seg id="53">Furthermore, new arrivals without language skills offered jobs in areas where there is no active understanding with people is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="20">At the second channel are illegal weapons, the Ordnungshütern of criminals are stolen.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranez explained that these weapons, both from the armouries to the police and directly of staff of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Further arms sold illegally from military arsenals seem to come.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many Militärlagern it was often explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">'There is evidence that it is in some cases of arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons,' says the former military personnel.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">Make a contribution to the black market in accordance with Baranez the arms manufacturers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">'Nowadays there are countless private Rüstungsfabriken, the international competition and therefore not withstand the weapons in the hands of the black market, for example in Moscow, squander', the expert reports.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another channel of the black market is smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Particularly many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">'That is there a own, sometimes artisanal production and a mafia, the smuggling organised', the former military personnel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Where are the weapons?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts have calculated what proportion of each of the five channels to the supply of the black market with illegal arms around.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the year 2011 was a report by the Centre for Problemanalysen and public administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The experts and analysed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of the Federal Service of State statistics, forensic literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the issue of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons is, according to the investigators from the army and the Rechtsschutzbehörden.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons were there on the black market by the 'blame of those responsible in their work to do with weapons have reached', it says in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The data of researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% thefts in the arms, and 5% comes from illegal archaeological excavation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">A Verkaufsberater a Waffenladens, not to be named, rest assured that weapons in illegal archaeological excavation be found, for a long time nobody buys, because they are obsolete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">According to him, it is more that traders in the supply to obtain a weapons cache.</seg>
<seg id="39">On a Fähnrich will be a weapon, for example a gun Type TT, bought.</seg>
<seg id="40">The weapon and will be issued by the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">'The traders brings the weapon in the city and sells them there for EUR 900 per with two magazines', he tells</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">'The police know, of course, on everything and, therefore, if the plan for the detection of crimes cannot fulfil periodic Kontrollkäufe dealers, the illegal arms', the offer Verkaufsberater.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="52">Newcomers are looking for weapons, in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried in the 1990 ’ s as buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this issue.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the last few days there was in the US to massive protests against low wages in branches of popular restaurants and Walmart Fast-Food-Ketten as's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy 's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Yet no one can predict whether the protests still further swollen or whether they will soon be back to the air.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protests are of trade unions and several left-wing voluntary organisations.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the increase of the modest wages of simple Walmart- and Fast-Food-Beschäftigten pursue the objective of the organisers of the protests to form trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this sector of the economy are not organized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents in the year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called black Friday, which took place in the US sales, the millions of customers anlockten, which sometimes Handgemengen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To this day, some Walmart-Mitarbeiter, of which there are 2.2 million in the world, their work and bestreikten together with trade unions and leftist activist branches of the chain, which is targeted at people are low and middle-income.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">All the products sold Walmart, of children's nappies on Jagdgewehre and Autobatterien to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The goods in the Walmart-Filialen is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is why many of the minor paid Walmart-Beschäftigten buy only on their own workplace.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prices and the Warensortiment Walmart made to one of the largest companies in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Critics often Walmart, according to the product can only sell so favourable, because the staff are poorly paid.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter are complaining about serious conditions, for example, the lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants of the protests on the 'black Friday' wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the betriebseigene health insurance from 30 to $100 per month has risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Walmart-Mitarbeiter, the 9.5 of $an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company the average wage to 12 dollar the hour, it increased Walmart 3.2 billion dollars would cost.</seg>
<seg id="20">These are approximately 1.1% more than they now for pay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Would the wage increases Walmart fully pass on to the customers, every shopping in future it will only 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">Per year would be for it, compared to today an additional cost of only 12,39 dollar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it in only nine States to protests and that the company has caused any losses.</seg>
<seg id="24">The black Friday took in its Laden from 8 p.m. on Thursday evening until midnight the next day, and in this period sold Walmart, approximately 5 000 articles per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a whole, the Walmart-Kassen on the 'black Friday' almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the site of the left-wing Huffington post that as a whole 'less than five' Walmart-Mitarbeiter niederlegten the work and the action only 'another PR stunt' the trade union, the protests have been organised.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">'Free' coffers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests, this week in New York, where its aim, however, not Walmart-Filialen (which in this advanced city therefore not desirable, and are), but so far non-existent McDonald and other low-cost restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says that the companies sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted not Krankentage, and you will not pay for your work honestly!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a Member of the New York City</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At present, the minimum wage in accordance with a federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollar the hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">The minimum wage in Fast-Food-Restaurants will gradually increased, but not too much, and on average have their simple staff in New York USD 8,90 the hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As it is possible, in New York, with so little money, is beyond me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">It was a time, almost a quarter of all US young people after school at McDonald's behind the Theke was, however, the young people still living in their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hardly a saw in that the main source of income or planned to continue to remain there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">I now face in interviews with staff McDonald's constantly people who complain that they do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, there are in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal, a comment, whose rapporteur points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if it did not know how they should feed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protests, on Thursday at 6.00 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began in demanding that the cashier and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants a minimum wage of USD 15 the hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They invited to the education of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The US law prohibits the corporate governance, this objective to stand in the way and trade union members abzumahnen or dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the management of them is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="43">The establishment of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche is difficult but also for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most important reason is the high staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Discontented</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Loud protests in this day there were also many other Fast-Food-Restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The culmination of the protests was an assembly the afternoon before the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including Stadtratsmitglied Jumaane Williams, who said: 'McDonald's, it says sell billion chickens, and yet they are granted not Krankentage, and you will not pay for your work honestly!'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were also of other prominent New York Democrats supports, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that 'we should support the Fast-Food-Mitarbeiter together, so that they receive a fair wages and the economic prosperity, everyone can achieve the New York deserves!'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">According to the New York Times this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the US Fast-Food-Industrie.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, were only a few hundred people on the ground, of which is far from all in the Fast-Food-Branche are employed in New York, in the tens of work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not yet clear whether the spark will mobilise all of these protests masses.</seg>

<seg id="3">Google first presented in the summer in its annual conference in November, a working model was then known that Microsoft had registered a patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In conversation with the head of the Group for interactive 3D-Technologien in Cambridge in Microsoft-Labor Shahram Izadi, is clear that the lens of the scientists of the company was only a Durchgangsstation.</seg>
<seg id="5">It rewards the possibility of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and virtual Freiflächen create.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Beschreiben you please briefly, what research your group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the borders of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">So far largely, humanity is stuck in the phase in which to work with Pixeln Flachbildschirmen which sometimes also be affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, we want vorausblicken 5-10 years and the radical changes of this interaction foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, are the Xbox-Konsole and the Kinect-Sensoren a step forward, and today will no longer be sold without Kinect Xbox, as all for movement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What we are still in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although Kinect the interaction of a physical level, is playing a great deal still on the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The submission of information (the system more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change that are working on genuine three-dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of different technologies, including projections.</seg>
<seg id="15">We must dismiss Computerwelt in our physical world and make it comprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is required, however, that it is not only the users, but also its surroundings, will be recognised.</seg>
<seg id="17">We could then the real world much easier by virtual objects.</seg>
<seg id="18">And first and foremost, we should be rid of these bescheuerten Virtual-Reality-Helme!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about Sprachsteuerung?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is popular, but will they not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- you is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because it raises questions about privacy, because we do not always all others, on its actions and intentions would like to inform.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, any kind of interaction with computers good, however, each in their certain niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, we in the field of governance of objects, in public places in a project in which we have with short and scarce, rather than with sprawling gestures experimentierten.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures not by the Objektkamera, but by a bracelet recorded the movements of the bones and muscles registered.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is still relatively large, could in theory, however, to the size of a wristwatch be narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="26">But as a whole, however, is the future, for example, mixed Steuerungstypen Gestik and language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- We would you ask me, for example, to you this Sprudeldose rich?</seg>
<seg id="29">They say it and to suggest at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Normally I say it simply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- oh, that would be very difficult to see.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">This means that you want to - that the users adapt to it, what a machine can make the relevant time, and what does not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- It is not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that we in the next time, especially in the development of new types of work will need to make it possible reactions of people in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="35">This can be Lasersensoren for example in depth, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- What demands you on the basis of your work with the Xbox Kinect-Sensoren to modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">There is a lack of disintegration, or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of the three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, 8 Megapixel with a rate of 1 000 fps not bad.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">In view of all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of algorithms have more work.</seg>
<seg id="42">It must not only the unraveling along the girl and XY the Y-, but also along the Z-Achse be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="43">The speed and the number of the images per second are important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The movements of people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, are the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a Berührungssensor with a regulierbaren Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1% to 100 of milli-seconds for, with today ’ s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 and 100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For my work I was just such a device, only without Berührungssteuerung and with more images per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- the number of the cameras Müsste not be increased?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- Kinect is currently working with three 'cameras', with one of them actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of this is reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-Kamera.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe.</seg>
<seg id="52">Perhaps more cameras could solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or the problem, because more calculations would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice Kinect-ähnliches a flexible system where we could play with various Kameraneigungen to see how we in the three-dimensional identifying a position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- if I remember correctly, Google, Microsoft in contrast to his glasses not the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens the best prospects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course, it is not always pleasant, on a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: the tollste formula would be a 'rotating' enlarged reality, in which we have a cloud of the impact on the smart phone could tune</seg>
<seg id="58">The lens is a personal 'gadget' and is its strength (private only you can see), but at the same time its weakness, because an enlarged reality through the lens prevented that you, together with others to virtual objects able to work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Let us a moment that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air not only Mr Stark from Iron Man, but also human beings.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem, to the critics often out of this idea: there is no tangible response.</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands of feel nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers to your group on this objection?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures, I often talk of the fact that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the taktilen perception.</seg>
<seg id="65">An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.</seg>
<seg id="66">It takes pressure excellent true!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also actually technologies, which are geared to the 'images in the air' to give something concrete, for example, the collision of some Ultraschallstrahlen addressed in a certain point, where the finger, a sense, but at the moment is so weak, as someone on the Handballen pustete.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bands for the Commission on the nerve endings detect tissue injury in the fingers, that is also a potential direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried to the brain to outflank?</seg>
<seg id="70">It think that it can feel that what it should, if it is just something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- That is a good idea, as we have not yet been tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here lies another task to which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a person physically in a closed area, to believe that it is instead in an open, virtually endless area; we are working on concepts with Laufbändern (other than in Fitnessstudios), mobile platforms and large bullets.</seg>
<seg id="73">So far is only moderately outflank the brain, and we still have many hard work for years.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is precisely this makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researchers thus attractive: many issues we are only at the start.</seg>

<seg id="18">- In an exhibition in Kulturpalast Newskij, in my work were issued.</seg>
<seg id="19">I realised that I must go this way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painters at the time to end, and new and free painter such as I was incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="21">I am on friendly terms with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the 'Gazonewschina'; hence, 'Puschkinskaja 10', and then that was the first conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is me to the theatre, to fashion, music, literature, except to all.</seg>

<seg id="23">- And all the united in your Art-Klinik... - It was important to me, at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best artists should meet.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I have an area in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there to the renovation musikalisch-künstlerischen a club for the Boheme that the House of the Petersburg Boheme.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and, I also remember string with its project 'Ucho Van Goga' go there.</seg>
<seg id="26">String and his friends, simple songs for Play-back close Jersey, and was one of them also of mature composer Igor Wdowin today.</seg>
<seg id="27">As the group, began to live to play, for their 'Leningrad'.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg facilitated many programmes before the time of 'Halli-Galli'.</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began its great careers, but the foundations he learned with us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Also the gallery 'D 137 of the club' or 'Griboedov' have their origin in Art-Klinik.</seg>
<seg id="31">Were to our staff and Stammgäste.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the last century, when culture still something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000 there was a survey in the press, in order to award 'personalities of our town'.</seg>
<seg id="34">I won in the category of 'artists of the year, and so that I was at the peak.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not easy, in new times that old rules to work; I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the present time, it is simply, to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: it can be known, without a cultural contribution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Your work - have a distinctive style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- Many my images are real gems and clearly the topical and acute the idea.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will be an exhibition with the subject of 'The Russian museum as a clown'.</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">I was previously socially, but now it pains and fear, to be the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">In a clown blurred all this, and is losing its tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the grotesque, and I have preposterous ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">We save the world, for example by making that everyone has fully to dress up.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now all respects to the clothing and is based on the Outer and not at the heart of the people.</seg>
<seg id="46">But perhaps we should not give a people, but it should in the face of biting.</seg>
<seg id="47">The deceit disappear by the dress up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Before recently we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - A City of Culture should have a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, if not I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Commercial art - can also be nice?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Commercial art - Nowadays there must be careful, respectful and flattering.</seg>
<seg id="52">We see the disintegration of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Previously, the people: the large groups Bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="54">There is now Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to all.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am no Einhundert-Dollar-Note, which everyone likes.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now you must consider, whom you will have fallen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now everyone has Kultstar roughly 100 supporters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- On the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- On him are abandoned women, there is a role the sexuell-soziale sphere.</seg>
<seg id="60">For cultural reasons are 300 people and not 10 thousand, consequently, there is less management, money, and everything is based.</seg>
<seg id="61">I voted in favour, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy the achievements.</seg>
<seg id="62">In my youth I have painted such images, at a gathering even in a number of the works of, Falk and Larionow.</seg>
<seg id="63">I started with images, which normally only at the end of the career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Nowadays, there is often misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="65">It says: intellectual culture and culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">Consumption has absolutely no culture, that is something quite different.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of the last culture and grew up with artists in poverty and lived in poverty died and refused to raise money.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is the culture, which I am in favour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- the best be cultural experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">It says: servant of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">But not all of them can deal with culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the real tsars it was different, because the tsars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.</seg>
<seg id="75">What we have in St. Petersburg, the experts could, but they will be barred hochrangigerer experts, because it is for the former and properly evaluate them open the way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now is only the own taste.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that it honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore other museums must seek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">- What is for you Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is much more culture and a breeding ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">On our stones can art difficult to grow up.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more than readers and writers, that is not right.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are many, people who visit exhibitions or concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are much less.</seg>
<seg id="84">Art must again be modern, so as to the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="64">Without the Erdanziehung to feel, can the organism the skeleton and muscles not train.</seg>

<seg id="1">NKÚ-Chef: control of the failed Schwarz-Systems by fault of the policy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts on good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, however, is in their application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In conversation for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Mr Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">'A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that this is not the case with us, "Kala comment on the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A similar outcome is also appears to have a common control by Czech and German auditor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As a negative Praxisbeispiel it introduces the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so-called 'Schwarz-System'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS the entrepreneurs not trouble with controls - is the system is now banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="8">'A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then surely cannot simply Regierungsvorsitzende, and this one, whose duty now even the monitoring of compliance with the law is, in its work', is hindering Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the Temporary Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, in the framework of the laws of both countries on public contracts have been compared with each other.</seg>
<seg id="10">What did it because in practical terms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel examination, with which we have started around two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, it is important that the European legislature to establish how to handle public contracts are to build on the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All this, we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet completed, we were extremely interesting differences. In general terms, are the laws we are perhaps even a little 'strict and perfect', the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more precise rules. We must also with the actual application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How can you help the project? what is for you for this project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It is precisely such a common control could help us that we stop constantly to an improvement of the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this is obviously not particularly positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Efficiency means that a matter to a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It is perhaps even so that we in this way the system only with excessive paperwork "burden", and those who seek loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold is higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As is the control system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a similar authority, as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What the authorities is concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ the Federal Audit Office that is built as with us and also on a college, which is only slightly different, will be set up. In principle, however, similar to work both authorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The powers are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, a federal state, i.e. that it is these courts of auditors in the individual Länder - it is different from the German system of our.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The only receives BRH must monitor what is in line with our public funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public resources which are of the counties, and communities are administered, let there be subject to control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What the German legislation is concerned, is the easier than our?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general, I would like this without any definite indications only compare. Nevertheless, Germany, in some ways, often described as a model, but it certainly cannot say that Germany in particular, is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This is perhaps remember that the auditors are better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">This certainly not, however, as I said: comparisons of this kind may I do not particularly like to.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is still be noted that, those countries which are a model for us, also with the problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, is it not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What the Czech legislation, what significance for your authority, the revision of the Vergabegesetzes feel you have any impact?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Given that this new directive is only a short time in force, is it not yet in our assessments.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since our controls afterwards, we must take place here with a degree of delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We have more impact felt in the preparation of future controls - as we have the new control 'identification of risks of inefficiency' introduced and with this almost 14, public contracts examined and analysed - this will, of course, the amendments, because the thresholds change the conditions for certain types of contracts were among the modified</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">You see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">It can, however, the problem, that the rules' strict 'and not be more can be met.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the previous rules are a test unterzogenen people to the agencies (for example, in the event of an operational programme of the Regional Policy, the Regional Council) to be accountable, so that any breach of the Vergabegesetzes a violation of the budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">However, it is then even stricter sense, the law?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not think that in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who attack and to abuse the system, and not penalise those who a formal errors committed to the actual decision-making not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Where is the way out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We say first of all, what is not successful.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called 'Schwarz-Systems' would be helpful, what exactly does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Is the Schwarz-System now banned or permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">A law must, but its application, and if something is forbidden by law, then surely cannot simply Regierungsvorsitzende, and this one, whose duty now even the monitoring of compliance with the law is, in its work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He can say: 'We change the law and allow the matter', but he cannot say that we act as if nothing would be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The procurement law which owes much contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is for the protection of public competition also correct.</seg>
<seg id="52">On the other hand, it is also tragic if the contract with the best offer simply because of Formfehlern is excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is what I believe that we are lacking.</seg>

<seg id="1">On our concerts Šimon Ornest: we want to collect positive energy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about that, in less than a month ago the end of the world should take place?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is one of those Katastrophenmeldungen, on which we so like to people can start up again.</seg>
<seg id="4">With our band The TAP TAP make us more about fun and say that we are the only band of the world, which have sufficient positive energy can gather, in order to prevent or stop the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December, you also achieve a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you imagine our readers closer to the project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung, which we are already two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this, we want to use the Maya-Kalenders Marketingpotenzial, whose end to the 21 December at 11: 10 a.m. is predicted.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before, in other words on 20 December, from 21: 00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and of Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">The end of the concerts is about to be the time, on the Pacific island Kiribati, in a zone of 12 hours before us is the Maya-Kalender ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who is criticising this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally from me, then we have the idea, together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this connection, we would not only to collect sufficient positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to reflect together with the public about the state of the world even our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of the Maya-Kalenders we also have a unique range of shoes, t-shirts, pockets and Schlüsselanhängern against the end of the world, with their purchase on www.e-tap.cz us also support the people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The band The TAP TAP, together with other actors also known as the anthem against the end of the world with the title 'end of the world falls from'.</seg>
<seg id="16">Already today, the anthem on YouTube very popular. It will also on the Benefizkonzerten being proposed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, very finally, provided that everything works and the end of the world is not happening...</seg>
<seg id="18">The anthem of all the actors at all three concerts at the same time be sung.</seg>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, the anthem together in a Direktschaltung by the Czech TV broadcast live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The text of the anthem by Tomáš Hanák, of the main character of Jesus, also plays in Videoclip Xindl X singing with...</seg>
<seg id="21">How are you to the cooperation with both come?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We also cooperate with other figures in the Czech world, which related to it that we have many Benefizveranstaltungen and concerts realise...</seg>
<seg id="23">We are trying to these people in our projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has transpired that the most interest in working with us, and to have fun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What purpose, the proceeds of the concerts benefit against the end of the world?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the establishment of a barrier-free Bildungszentrums Studeo, on which we are already six years, together with the club TAP in Jedlička-Institut work.</seg>
<seg id="27">The students are regularly Jedlička-Instituts of teachers who help them with different leisure activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">As the students themselves do not have the resources to the teachers, quite frankly, we want to help them in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the completion of the Jedlička-Instituts is to create a separate buildings, in which we then with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In any concert are several groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">You have that the criteria selected?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We wanted to put together a programme, which addresses all generations, including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For instance, in Prague, Support Chinaski Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">You know anything further on the website www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"similar" large-scale events are also planned for the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May, we are for the first time in the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing a very interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, we would also like to see in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we then in the United States - this would also like to with appearances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Their Auslandspläne are not just small, so far you are already in Madrid, London, Brussels or in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">The TAP TAP is, however, a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How to address you this travel logistical and organisational?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five of our Members are wheelchair users, i.e. the need to be transported in wheelchairs Gepäckraum. We must also, of course, many Instrumentenkoffer and different luggage mitschleppen...</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, it has always worked, without problems ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared to us that I am sometimes surprised have already partially.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Through your foreign trips you have a comparison, as in the individual countries with accessibility, as they deal with disabled people, etc.</seg>
<seg id="46">As you have seen these things?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, in which everything works better than us, particularly in Russia, we were witnesses that in the East, everything still in its infancy.</seg>
<seg id="48">Moscow to Prague for the disabled is absolutely not. It is still unusually, if someone in a wheelchair is travelling alone in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is there not even, of course, that you have a wheelchair users, for example, in the lift vorlässt.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately, clubs, there are also trying to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in what respect, we need to the more developed countries catch up?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are still many things, in which we are lagging behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">There is still to note that an improvement of the situation also always depends on the efforts of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities self-employed in the public space, go into a museum, toilets can use, etc.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not usual that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social affairs, we are with the band The TAP TAP the West a bit ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if our ranks significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, are the things that really begin to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken figures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The TAP TAP is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: what have you in the year 1998, a bond motivated to set up?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">At that time did I, as carers in Jedlička-Institut, where I met many young people who were interested in, with a little hard.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I am playing Saxofon musicians and, among other things, I, together with a colleague a Musik-AG established.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and with the time is that, as our host, Láďa Angelovič, to say, somewhat out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">It was known the bond but only in recent years, or I am wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers has helped; we have also started actively for us to promote.</seg>
<seg id="64">We are aware that, if something is to the outside world and this is not to see their own performance in a sense, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the EU grant money we can also good teachers, high-quality equipment and operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It was your objective, it with The TAP TAP so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the outset I have the potential felt that we can address the situation is different.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the show business today often copied a the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">That is on its way logical, as anything new taken with caution and only after some considerable time will be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="70">There is only a few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that, TAP TAP is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of the spectators has usually is, of course, compassion; this is only, of course,...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this compassion is totally superfluous, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned beings, which we regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if people with disabilities, something that not only for themselves a step forward, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">It was for this success helpful that you are a strict head, as one of many people listening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If you would like to make something good in many things, we must not compromise and must also demand a certain degree of discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">I believe that this is completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some come with romantic ideas, and then, when they discover that they have tested twice the week, stages and must overcome, sponsoring concert tours spend a lot of time, will cease to the enthusiasm among many quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">So it works but everywhere, in each band, the serious work and wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, The TAP TAP twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were from the outset, in other words since 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one: Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group. The people come and go. This cannot be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="84">Anyone who has the will and the desire on Mitmachen with us, is always welcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Will take place on the day before the end of the world, Thursday the projected 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, Poland was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency - as a Member of this Space zwanzigstes. Poland is so that the second Member State from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was ESA-Mitglied on 12 November 2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began in 1994 a close cooperation with the ESA and participated in the following years in several ESA-Projekten.</seg>
<seg id="4">The path of Poland in the space began, however, much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space sector, which is not always understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would remind you here, for example, the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December in the Warsaw Observatory 1933, in which the author of ideas from its pioneering Kosmonautik 'to' presented.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (another. 1905), the audience, however, cold, and after years, still Šternfeld that only Dr Jan Gadomski interest shown in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld won the year in 1934 Kosmonautik 'for' entrance to the of Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten Prix REP-Hirsch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of Astronomy and space travel.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines published he wrote several hundreds of articles and books to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomskis of internationally recognised contribution to the development of space has been appreciated by, among other things, that one of the crater on the side of the moon erdabgewandten after it has been appointed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925 a Eisenbahn-Draisine has been built in Poland, for which a Raketenantrieb was planned.</seg>
<seg id="13">The author of the text and the details of this project were unfortunately unknown.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even been clarified, whether the missile taking-off or on the brakes on the Draisine should be used.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information on this come exclusively from the contemporary press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933 began with the Polish infantry raketenbetriebenen munitions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research, the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the traditional documents is clear that the research to the stage of practical tests was reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">The research was then, however, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht suspended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, appeared in the press of the originating. Rohoziński message draft fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete, and in the following year, the work 'Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza' of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war were all projects to military use of the suggested by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinated.</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of work, his work, however, the war ended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Other articles appeared after the war on space travel thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">The first mention of this society will take place in 1954 in the Novemberausgabe the magazine Problemy, in the four major article of the space.</seg>
<seg id="26">The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the research of space future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Already in its inception in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft a PTA accession to the 1951 established International Federation for space, and indeed the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956 proper a Member.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space.</seg>
<seg id="30">This office, he had, until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 the PTA participated in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type, the RM-1 has been completed, in 1957, the first start on 10 October in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The missile with a maximum altitude of 1 800 metres around 80 cm was long and weighed not quite 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built, and in the Błędów-Wüste Flugtests 1959 began with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The missile was 1.4 m in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">A further stage should already be able to make real scientific work - the missile RM-34 should an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of Höhenwinden.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 1962, however, was the further development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Successor of the first missiles of the type RM was in the years 1962 to 1965 developed Meteor-1-Rakete.</seg>
<seg id="39">The missile was conceived as Zweistufenrakete their overall length, and the take-off weight 510 cm was 32 500 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Three types of this missile have been developed, and (Meteor-1A -1B -1C), which each other, in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area, with 0.4 litres to be legalised, Meteor-1B on 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C on 0.62 litre.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum altitude, in all three types of 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the years in 1965 until 1968 was developed in the Meteor-2-Rakete Luftfahrtinstitut, whose first Flugtests began in October in 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kilograms and was able to 10 kg applicable in a level of around 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">Then the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 being built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is also worth pointing out the accession of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, on the two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland participated in the framework of the Interkosmos-Programms also in the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second Interkosmonaut.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, the Constitutional Court on the law on voluntary work.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision, in the public, a lively debate.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is certainly interesting, the issue from a wider perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is due to the principle of free trade and of the free and unrestricted movement of private capital with unbridled financial speculation, which goes hand in hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because of the major differences of the value of work (wages), it is to Preisspannungen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept is a state to understand, in which the manufacturer tried, through import cheaper goods in the economic competition, by making the labor force 'competition', to make a greater market share to usurp and to increase its profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">In large measure does this mean for the majority of companies to relocate their production abroad to buy or favourable, or to abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the private sector will be no social responsibility and, therefore, no responsibility for the rising unemployment, it caused is necessarily the government spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">This situation will be strengthened by the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage caused to replace.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics on this point are superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="14">The predatory practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to engage in competition with each other, to the social level of their own population and thus to artificially reduce the country to attract foreign capital.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the governments provide its own population without regard for the social consequences of the private capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">This manifests itself in particular in changes to existing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim of these measures, it is, to force its own population, the dictates of the private capital, especially in terms of to accept.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is happening on the one by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other by the curtailment of workers' rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result, the growing poverty, and ever greater differences between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany there have been for some years, public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people is already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the wake of the increase the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive such a low wages, that the state to increase their income by the subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal has also been in the case of the German Bundestag employed workers exposed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity of practically all EU-Südstaaten will no doubt at the same situation, with the people under the pressure of a disastrous crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as in the nineteenth century was the case), or for a pittance to languish on the fringes of society and hope that eventually private investment will flow into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here is, of course, the question of where this capital?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it from another EU country, is only the poverty of a country to another; or capital is altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This concerns the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state with capital in its own economy must be involved, and that planned economy to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private capital narrow-minded insists on its position that the state has not lenkend must intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">But then we have to ask whether the capital, the policy and therefore the whole state in their own selfish interests or even influenced.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here is the clear answer: yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual benefit, a legislation, in the criminal practically everything, but nothing is a punishable offence.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany is the situation so that a lack of finances Staatsministerium private, with the industry interdependent Rechtsunternehmen with the drafting of legislation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This draft legislation then have to be adopted in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All violence is not more popularly, as the western constitutions, but of strong financial groups, which prefer their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly in a situation, as they Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompeius' describes: 'The State was long since the break-up of, and the posts are occupied with violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">Against bribes, by unlawful fraudulent use of advantages or stone and sword.</seg>
<seg id="39">The corruption wucherte incontinent, and the people with already buy votes to vote '...' people with nature bewarben not for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul '... "It began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is an autocracy, and that a strong man should be chosen'... Appian thought to Pompeius admittedly, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, the democracy permanently by the dictatorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As is apparent, is today's society as well as in ancient times to the reckless preference of the own advantage, without on societal interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private sector is already by its very nature, not in the situation, the advantage for the whole of society to recognise and enforce.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result, today, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, which is not the slightest concern for deeper reforms.</seg>
<seg id="43">The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore, in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="44">The current state of view, the fall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies, be regarded as some pause in the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">Particularly disastrous is the fact that today ’ s elites in future the loss of hundreds of lives, the humanitarian and social catastrophes, we witnessed already today, and the crimes against humanity, as we in the older and more recent history know, in total ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="46">The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution, at least no lasting.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition, will the Czech Republic, also continue to be forced to look for ways to the social level of the population to push down.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore bound.</seg>

<seg id="6">At this point I would like to write about who is not in these recurring waves of killing guilty and who were victims; at the end of today ’ s inhabitants of Israel, including the Selbstverwaltungsgebiete born in the current political situation and have not seen the violence began itself.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am talking about the readers look behind the scenes to open the context of whom the 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November in 1917) in the small spaces country in the Middle East in particular.</seg>
<seg id="8">My thoughts are based in part to accessible historical facts, others are of this nature and go from my own understanding of, who or what the group of people the events of the modern history significant impact on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every era, we can Alexander the Great or Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is less evidently, the question is whether it really always these figures were certain autonomous their steps behind the throne, or whether anyone was, of their actions on a vorbestimmtes objective.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit that we live in a time of the wealth of the world in the hands of fewer of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power is not within the life span of a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Under these astronomical rich families is a particularly, which could be described as head of octopus have (I do not know whether someone is on them, I support this but not from) - the Rothschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Much will not written on it.</seg>
<seg id="15">Understandably.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) was of the Rothschilds already in the 1990s of the nineteenth century, bought the link with its name hochkriminellen action to prevent, in whose background is the consolidation of their power, the reproduction of their assets or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Rothschilds are nearly all the central banks of the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip itself to this (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall Ghaddafis only remained four, with Russia in the meantime, its central bank of the Russian Government has implied).</seg>
<seg id="18">Whoever has sought to face up to this family had to pay with their lives.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused to the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank to renew started during the civil war, their own (read: state) notes and 1865 issue was murdered in a theatre.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kennedy J.F. began to publish their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was murdered in 1963; the honourable Member Mr Mc Fadden in 1936, after he was poisoned the Fed for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929 wanted to sue.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">The global appetite the Rothschilds, 1859 - 1871 in the years to the formulation of a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemasons of the 33rd and highest degree of insight.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war had the aim of the major monarchistischen Staatenwesen of Europe, to eliminate the second war in particular British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is the world's population to approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of their benefits and its luxury and would also not so many resources to create a Universalreligion consume) (of ecumenism here is nothing more than the run-up to), and finally to the adoption of the absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method by which the Group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top is initiating a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (or from chao - order from the chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">But these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Federal Reserve, so that crises such as the of them in 1907 triggered not repeat).</seg>
<seg id="25">After it by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the First World War, destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded Germany ’ s capitulation (for the destruction of the Russian Russian empire, the war was not necessary), then, the dissolution of the Central European superpower Österreich-Ungarns.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the Second World War easier to spark, the bankers by the policy to create a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic Kriegsreparationen documented; that they created the condition of impoverished masses the Germans, so that they only have a sufficiently strong leader unterjubeln the culprits named and simple solutions offered; another factor was the creation of a multi-ethnic state Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which the role of a fifth column should take, and also the Kriegsbrand.</seg>

<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler of the chain broke, on the international bankers had initially thought, or whether it was only after plan is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was founded in 1948, and, as well as through Kriegsreparationen against Germany the ground for the Second World War was preparing, the proclamation of the State of Israel the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War.</seg>

<seg id="34">Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think how strongly the people of supporters and opponents of Israel, to divide).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only wrong in an endless cycle of violence, while at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979 occupied a mob Islamist students demonstrating the US Embassy in Tehran, 52 and diplomats as hostages.</seg>
<seg id="3">For their release they requested the extradition of the ousted Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, after the revolution in the US had fled, which for decades on the regime ’ s policy seems certain to be respected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the American Government, there were no positive outcome from this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah, since this is the confidence of its allies in other countries would have severely damaged.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime has resulted, the release of hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a serious blow for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to retrieve made it even worse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The captured diplomats were finally released for 444 days ago, after negotiations by the Algerian Government had been given.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fate of the hostages to home, a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer sentiments.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film director of the Argo and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, the United States, a small partial victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Immediately before the occupation of the message was six Botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight.</seg>
<seg id="12">This ended after many complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; helped to bring them a flamboyant story to Verdeckung to its true identity - they were travelling with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, the supposedly in the country visited Drehorte for a science-fiction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of Genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The experts' for 'Exfiltration, Tony Méndez, developed plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">So that the camouflage was credible, article published on this film in peer-reviewed journals, press conferences held, and the fictitious Produktionsgesellschaft had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, at the same time, but also a so-called 'Caper Movie', i.e. the history of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean 's Eleven.</seg>
<seg id="20">This change in the film Stimmungsebenen - on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen from Teheran (in the contemporary ikonische be Titelsequenz photographs shown, and also in the Filmfassung the same situations there are no major differences).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easily be taken to its extreme.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there is still the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions - men in suits on Besprechungstisch, on the Amtsfluren, on the telephone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable start of his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">From a belächelten actors is a respectable director, and also as an actor, it is now no longer the aim of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">ARGO is his third movie The after the whodunit No childsplay (Gone baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in the soil Boston of the director.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of the atmosphere was one of the place to the characteristics, which the previous films this film director, the standard Hollywood abhoben.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck proves this sense, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "'will be played.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the Eingangssequenz the storming of the message is in its clarity, and gives very impressive, the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability, if that happens, somewhere the history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong Filmstab in a bazaar in Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much to act in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had also to reflect that the history is not many in the cinema sense exciting scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the little but he is working quite successfully, and the reality sometimes rather nachhilft - then what is not always so elegantly works (the scenes, in the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone call in America is averted, or the chase on the runway, somewhat curious).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of the Argo is too broad spread by the need, too much to act in too many places have to show.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood-Mitarbeiter very charming, their figures but would have more areas deserves, and they are in the film far not alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Afflecks a film is losing traction. It is a film, with some interest and the shaping and to a thriller reminiscent of the 70 years Retro-Stil can approve.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, it inspires enthusiasm difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder to a until today, in some way of living of history and as proof of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, however, he is sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="55">I have also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, the fraud in trade with ease of fuel oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">My candidacy I began with the premise that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty per cent of voters are not at all to the elections, and the, who have left, have often elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, we are only two Independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">People have such a Senatszusammensetzung elected, that changes only be very difficult to implement.</seg>
<seg id="60">Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and Bezirkshauptmänner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about the creation of a own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not yet considered, because I do not have time, the past to check every potential Parteimitglieds, and certainly do not have the money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I still have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent accounts are only 20 000 CZK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">They have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">They are talking about Vermögenserklärungen, what would your?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I appreciate my private wealth to around CZK 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have a property in Prague with a value of 25 million, a home for approximately 10 million, a further for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth approximately 10 million, and a Ashton Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, approximately a million is worth. And then I have a few million to the bank account.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Ashton Martin was a Kindertraum - James Bond liked I have always been in the car, as he went to gallantly, and at the same time, women were fought against the evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">They drive a Ashton Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">They say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you do not want to invest in it.</seg>
<seg id="71">That is not convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">I have to make debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I have already 2.5 million in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my programme is not too much interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to the campaign own means.</seg>
<seg id="77">The costs for the campaign will in fact, covered by my salary as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But the Senatorengehalt I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not the English school finance, the 30 000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I just wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">You will remain so further work as entrepreneurs, in order to have your living?</seg>
<seg id="81">You said that you did not be cut back these activities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But this is not with the level of salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, I have my activities partly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="84">Thus, for example, my deputy director of the travel agents in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">The people want to see me as Samaritans, of the Republic of saving.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I also have to live by something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">Monthly income on which you were used as an entrepreneur?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Around 200 000 and 400 000, and that is still so.</seg>
<seg id="89">As President, I would however, my undertakings.</seg>

<seg id="6">No one is still in a this Old-Style-Bibliotheken voluntarily, or?</seg>

<p>

<seg id="8">The 80.000-Einwohner-Gemeinde, the lowest Bildungsrate the whole of the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to counteract this stupid fact, it was decided a few years, to education and the seven fictitious bridges, on the Euroscheinen, as depicted beautiful bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the pool in borders.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so did the Stadtväter that the only way, the statistics Mr: a library must ago.</seg>

<seg id="13">And while the jury is still intrigued to, and with the 'Transparent zuckte, stapelte the impudent Maas his splendid Mitbringsel to the size of a pyramid and ended his aktionistisch well-founded speech with the words:' My Stadtgemeinde! '</seg>
<seg id="14">It is, therefore, my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive Berg aufgeschüttet.</seg>

<seg id="18">Moreover, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award for 2012.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="19">That is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte which, hitherto, has not had to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly town hall, behind its white facades it would be inclined to suggest a Molkereifabrik a piece of contemporary architecture richer.</seg>
<seg id="20">But above all, Spijkenisse now on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long road to book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is admittedly a lift, through the middle of Bergmassiv, but the real regional and Lesefreuden the tap fußläufigen climbing the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The totally verglaste Innenraum is bright and transparent, gun-shy Klinkerboden and the elegant lights clearly speak the language of a public Stadtplatzes.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban atmosphere is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is already looking for Parkbank, the dog and boys and Mädels playing football.</seg>
<seg id="27">Books and everywhere, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">'We usually the's bookshelves along the façade, and in the centre is a large, dark areas, which mostly uncongenial and impersonal way is,' says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have the classic Raumkonfiguration on its head and the Lesebereich of comfortable inside out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The interior is Bücherbergs shrewdly: in the middle are offices, Internet library is, Schachclub, environment centre and Haustechnikzentrale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A particular pleasure, the black's bookshelves, the times Wandverkleidung, sometimes Brüstung, sometimes Stiegengeländer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Optics, are alien to Haptik and smell.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even die-hard architects and Civil Engineers shake whether of the unknown Baustoffs the head.</seg>
<seg id="34">'We wanted to work here with Recycling-Materialien ", declared Joop Trouborst, in the project manager Stadtgemeinde Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And we are in a friesländischen farms operating in a fitting one day waste from the agriculture.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="36">For many years, we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and in fields as a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies Wurzelunterlage.</seg>

<seg id="45">'You do not believe it would of course, but this House is despite the many Glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology,' says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heated and cooling, geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz is, it seems that the sun, even in sunny days only briefly Interior.</seg>
<seg id="48">The broad Holzleimbinder, the right to be outside glass, serve as Beschattung and begin a large part of the sun.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Raumklima is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">Do the rest fully automated Rollos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptics from the IT sector, dared already the way in the new library.</seg>

<seg id="53">And also the TCM-Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, even as the Boekenberg Spijkenisses' long overdue soul '.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: the opening of a few weeks ago was invited all residents, a book from his personal stock.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is for the time being the optical gaps in the not yet fully bestückten library - currently 70 000 of them - be filled.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept is clear.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are filled by obenhin.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: 'Germans need to make a greater role to play'</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine to abstain.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced Berlin to a narrow diplomatic level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">German wave: the beginning of the week, Germany had first signals that it against the request for observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then abstained Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have not done in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">Germany must now given its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I believe that it was not the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstained when it came to a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Finally, this has been implemented by the NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult to Germany on important international issues a clear position on the subject?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is true.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that it is precisely its foreign policy, surrounded and away from a policy to pay by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are found in other words, between the fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that they are still in its role, but they are on the path to a 'more normal "foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, as France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What does' a normal "foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the willingness to national interests to adopt positions, which are independent of which the US or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy of the economic policy is motivated by the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany ’ s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.</seg>
<seg id="27">That is why it must be careful, the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries not to offend the.</seg>
<seg id="28">This plays a role in any case.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would also the not too much weight to want, that is not wholly unilateral relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it is definitely an important role in German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany has damaged its relations with the US, by abstaining when important decisions, for example, in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, there is great understanding for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">That is why I do not believe that this is such a dramatic rift was, as in the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because it signals but that it will be taken seriously as an international player and its interests should be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe there are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States have been clear for a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Because of the American domestic politics have these differences which exist.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But because of the political situation here, the government can, of course, this position publicly not represented.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real differences are not so great as they always appear.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you turn to the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu Obama is not so upbeat about by Netanyahu ’ s policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It is Germany difficult, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other side?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I believe that this is what makes it difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">It would, of course, a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case today.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they can not part of a broader and foremost, and must instead be things from their own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">That they do precisely with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that in future, Germany will play a leading role, Europe to a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">That was always a sensitive issue.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I believe that the Germans it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Is Germany itself in the role as an important international players - Germany wants to play a major role at all?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or is still difficult for the leadership of Germany?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not accustomed to this is still an unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is the country still difficult to a greater role to play.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we look at us, for example, the euro crisis, because every time, when Germany has a greater role, various anti-deutsche feelings free.</seg>
<seg id="57">This makes it the Germans not easy.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is the old problem: you want not be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">So, Germany is seen in a much more difficult position as the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">There must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and this is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, the EU continually fill the vacuum but not at the moment, who is otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them and they still much less popular, c'est la vie!</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind it is a in China, which officially registered designation, however, nothing has to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless, it enjoys protection, as long as the actual Lord who brought not complain.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then, is not clear whether they are right.</seg>
<seg id="7">'It is always more difficult for foreigners, to protect their brands in China, "says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in the sessional services Taylor Wessing on Schutzrechtsverletzungen specialises in the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week a new case ends up on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The rich Nachahmern is already a few additional letter, so that they register their brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, instead of simply from Gucci Lu-Gucci Prada-Kny Prada, we register.</seg>
<seg id="11">German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturers Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens up a file with registration of the Community Trade Mark in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 14 September 2010, there was a Chinese company the trademarks Zegna DF Puma protect, a somewhat synthetic label, which is also the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Chinese world champion in copying and the injured intellectual property, is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the large cities, there are mehrstöckige department stores, the almost exclusively counterfeiting sell.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his clients is it that Chinese companies from the Trademarks Agency, officially, the right to use a term, the already elsewhere is protected.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call this' bang ', a Beifahrermarke Mingpai.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word is' Dakuan bang '.</seg>
<seg id="19">So that women are meant, the rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">'This is to deprive, we must combat', it calls for Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">'The brand Alleinstellung watered down, which will disappear, the damage to their image is enormous.'</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the litigation costs of the industries affected are in the millions, especially where expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA is China with a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But erased dubious entries in the Markenregister are difficult to achieve and go into the money.</seg>
<seg id="26">Up to nine years, the proceedings drag on, with uncertain results.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch reported of cases in which prompted the court cases, because after the long term the beanstandete name of "reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff must have the misfortune, he even Plagiator pay money, because it violated in China, whose brand Pattloch says.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">2009, Daimler a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, that companies, which recently took the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chinese must therefore use an emblem until today, which resembles the Mercedes-Stern.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Volvo-Käufer Geely used was originally a blau-weißes logo of BMW reminded; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Modehersteller Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous Crocodile look in the other direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Trademarks Agency CTMO in Beijing is true that there is 2010 for personnel and Raumausstattung bottlenecks.</seg>
<seg id="37">Last year was however, of the 'emergency situation in getting returned to normal life'.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals by 22%.</seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57, 000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, still waiting in the office 81.500 objections to carry out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It costs a lot of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for protection of trademarks, almost a third more than 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record and means that China on the tenth time in succession the list of Neuanmeldungen in the world, shares the authority with.</seg>
<seg id="45">This also applies to the existence of all current trademark 5.5 million, as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="46">2011 are 1.8 billion yuan to charges have been taken.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simplified, that means that any notification, on average, or yuan 1280 costs EUR 160.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It is costing many times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Although the Germans, whose illegal manufacture of imitation Kraftfahrzeugteile has been closed down.</seg>
<seg id="51">But secured the counterfeiters continue to the Chinese rights of the brand Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">We have failed to do this, as in Germany family name could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The Trademarks Agency CTMO, the opposition of the Munich because also back.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the next two bodies Freudenberg was right, but the Prozessgegner is fighting to further today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">We must watch your step</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now is the matter before the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confident that the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: 'The procedure is extremely expensive and will cost us much time, money and nerves'.</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs would be difficult to quantify, the Firmenarchiv even have a hundred years old files must go, in order to provide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago was Freudenberg the other side in vain for a 'high six-figure Eurobetrag' to the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">', it is very much reminded us how much is worth,' says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threaten to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Then, if there imitators vulnerable brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">This was a Chinese manufacturers in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">This business, the company, yet he has long since been abandoned the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">'You must watch your step,' says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies, in doing business with China to be very careful.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather the foreigners' everything that somehow is worth protecting, even in China 'register, as Wentzler says.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact: if Freudenberg in the last act of his Markendramas too, then we should probably the other side to pay royalties for the own behalf, declared Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we will be in question from the market segment.</seg>

<seg id="1">AIDS Day and sing help:</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi - and in Swaziland, children orphaned by AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="3">The history of a link, the far more than 8733 kilometres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First the us making all this noise: Cowboystiefel, Basketballschuhe Damenpumps Herrenslipper, and look to the Parkettboden find the pace, it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Eins-zwei-drei-vier.</seg>
<seg id="6">Only then thresholds the voices of the singer slowly - old, utterly, tone and Sopran - press, and pursue betören.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old a conductor, it almost from his Stoffschuhen, if it brings together with his elastic wild gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is on Monday evening, in the Musikraum of the Institute for Medizinische psychology in Heidelberg probt the chorus Imbongi a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the fifty Sängerinnen and singer arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, of the Humangenetikerin until the householder.</seg>
<seg id="10">'Om' Obani 'is not a simple way, every Chorstimme has a different text and this also in a foreign language: ethnic Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Help for self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In the world, there are around 34 million people infected with HIV, the estimates UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations to Bekämfung of AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million people live in southern Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland live 245000 children orphaned by AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than 40% of the population are now HIV-positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 children orphaned by AIDS in the village Esitjeni, the club Voices for Africa godfathers found in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them attend secondary school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 euros per month, we can take a sponsor.</seg>
<seg id="19">It guarantees the child Schuluniform school fees, and every day in the warm meals Gogo-Center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means to ethnic Zulu Geschichtenerzähler or Lobpreiser.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fluid Bantusprache can speak in this area, but no one.</seg>
<seg id="22">For almost ten years, the chorus of songs in this foreign soft language and brings them from time to go back to where they originally come from: in the South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">As the crow flies 8 733 kilometres of Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that the voting power of the German Chores depends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty per cent are infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Approximately 2 000 people live there, some still in simple Lehm- and Strohhütten, a large proportion of whom are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them have no parents more, because these are the HIV resistance.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Esitjeni is reflected in the small, which is suffering from quite Swaziland: high HIV-Infektionsrate, lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.</seg>
<seg id="28">Restrictions on the male Vorhaut, the risk of contagion demonstrably by half, will reduce the population of barely adopted.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty per cent of people in Swaziland bear the Immunschwäche-Virus, with the middle of thirty to die is not uncommon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In a common Afrika-Reise in the spring of 2005, the chorus of the village, but above all saw the Imbongis many children on the roads, which not only to parental responsibility, but simply to all: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">School without qualifications in a poor country has certainly not a chance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros in the year a child to school and to send him a warm meal a day.</seg>
<seg id="33">But was already a year later, the chorus of the club 'Voices for Africa', since almost professional the Aids-Waisen in Esitjeni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts to sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the main sexually-transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">To the bacterial STI, count syphilis chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral STI, HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Filzläuse and Krätze are among the parasite TSIs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen?</seg>
<seg id="40">Tripper syphilis and, above all, in men, the sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert-Koch-Institut assumes that at least four out of five of all in Germany notified Syphilis-Fälle through sexual contact between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the heterosexual adults are Chlamydien-Infektionen, Trichomonaden, Candidose (fungus), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren often occurring sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV is comparatively small adults under heterosexual here, however: around 20% of the new to this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among young people are Chlamydien-Infektionen much more frequent than in other groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">After European surveys relate to three quarters of infections young people between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">Here, also come Humane Pappilomaviren in young people often.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How has the number of infections developed?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of Syphilis-Infektionen, according to the Robert-Koch-Institut of 1697 diseases 3698 diseases in 2001 to more than doubled in the year 2011.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new, since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">2011, there were around 2 700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about a tenth of less than in the year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What symptoms point to a contract?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can ulcers in Genitalbereich, complaints to the, a product, and urinate Unterbauchschmerzen Bläschen or Warzen.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often, however, they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can we protect itself?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion to offer protection, but not a 100%.</seg>
<seg id="58">Because, in part, can cause of sexually transmitted diseases also by Schmierinfektionen and close just be passed on.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore recommend experts in particular often changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups.</seg>
<seg id="60">Early diagnosed STI the majority can be cured and have avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">By godmothers, donations and not least the Gagen, the chorus throughout Germany ersingt, is a great deal together.</seg>
<seg id="62">'All in all, we have already around EUR 200 000 sent after Esitjeni,' says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the associations.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village Zodwa Dlamini even managed, a self-confident and durchsetzungsstarke Mrs, the money from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is also looking to ensure that the orphans, in a particularly good example of the Grandmothers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The Gogos, as the old women on ethnic Zulu CITES are the mainstays of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have up to 14 orphans in, giving them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day to schooling appear on time.</seg>
<seg id="67">Anyone who has more to come into Schutzhaus Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club, as well as the two cooks, every day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Moreover, 'Voices for Africa' a Nähschule launched two Hühnerhäuser built and together with the American health arrangements PSI organised, that many in the village a HIV-Test have.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not a matter of course, because obviously the disease in the whole country is, it remains silent they prefer dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">'AIDS is an absolute taboo Annette Lennartz,' says, 'because it has to do with sexuality.'</seg>
<seg id="72">Strange in a country in which the King officially 14 wives.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch King Mswati III, sub-Saharan Africa, is known for its excessive lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Among other things, it is also due to this state sanctioned way of life that the HIV in the last few decades has spread so quickly.</seg>
<seg id="76">But also the many migrant workers, the virus around the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">There would be free of condoms in every corner, Annette Lennartz says, 'but which are hardly being used.</seg>
<seg id="78">Culture is a different - flesh to flesh '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">In order to promote the cultural exchange, the two, three years Imbongi-Chor all jointly by the South Africa and singing songs of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, the many on the southern bit of the black continent even in times of apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bus full of whites who sing songs in a black language - as much recognition is not only mood and pleasure, but has also been some grim border guards a few tears abgetrotzt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The journey will always lead to Esitjeni, where the singer their godchildren visit.</seg>
<seg id="82">Even though the small village on maps, little will take place in the valley of Ezulweni-Flusses it is more than known.</seg>
<seg id="83">'Is after Esitjeni, as is the light' say the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And if we consider the crow flies 8733 kilometres for Heidelberg return to the stampfenden singers in the Proberaum Bergheimer in the street, then we see it as well.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="50">Our insights into space telescopes the most important:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope 1608 by Hans Lipperhey to be invented - even before Galileo Galilei Sternenbeobachtung a year later on.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes increasing - and the insight that they provide, deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">30 years, namely of 1947 in 1975 was the Hale-Teleskop in San Diego Palomar-Observatorium close to the greatest Fernrohr the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.</seg>

<seg id="59">Nevertheless, it is a diameter of some eleven metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">Detriment of the favourable construction: the telescope is in his Höhenwinkel us - and this in its flexibility.</seg>

<seg id="74">They offer two mirror with an average of 10 metres.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Keck-Teleskope are part of the Mauna-Kea-Observatoriums which, alongside them with the Subaru-Teleskop and the IRTTF looks in the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Also on Mauna KEA a new, huge telescope - with a Spiegel-Durchschnitt of 30 metres.</seg>
<seg id="77">Here it is an illustration to gaze at.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">The most important impressions from space, however, does the Weltraumteleskop Hubble.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since 24 April 1990 it already provides pictures of distant worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, is seeking the Weltraumteleskop Kepler after extrasolaren planet - mainly for such, the inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">On 2 February 2011, from NASA announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn have been identified.</seg>

<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: it is in light of the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume that the South Pole of the ice Mercury has continued to exist.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there is no reliable data, since the messenger far closer to the North Pole for the planet.</seg>

<seg id="10">Everything is green and stiff, one might think that it is in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here, the Caucasian the Talyschen that not much is aware, except that they perfect Persian and Aserisch speaks and very long-lived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Final destination is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">The small city flaunts to greedy wuchtig architecture of Soviet times, which are not in the picturesque Berglandschaft to fit.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists come from Europe, here too onerous is hardly the capital of Azerbaijan Baku.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="18">But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that the stuff Lerik to tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">'Baku was in May with the famous Eurovision-Song-Festival - and in the next year we have here a festival of the oldest people of the world', says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="20">It is the Director of the Museum of longevity, is the only in the world.</seg>

<seg id="27">'1805 when he was born here in the region, in 1973, he died' Fatulayeva explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man is three times have been married and have 23 children, in the age of 136 years he should have created a daughter.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="37">The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the with the special genes Talyschen.</seg>
<seg id="38">Museumsdirektorin Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is in the diet.</seg>
<seg id="39">But that it should be the kalorienreiche Talyschen as healthy diet of the meat, bread and milk products, above all love and many of which daily geschmolzene butter drink a glass, seems from a nutritional point of view it is not plausible.</seg>

<seg id="40">Or is it the original way of life, the young people? in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city, Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.</seg>
<seg id="41">With their 97 years, it is for these regions still relatively young.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, which claims, 143 descendants have to live in a simple Holzhaus, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.</seg>

<seg id="3">The key of the country could do with the local appetite for rather nasty smelling fish have to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">We note a selection überreifer cheese.</seg>
<seg id="5">We in the midst of a crowd platziere it against dirty, more humid.</seg>
<seg id="6">And they leave that a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">Approximately one must the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk imagine that one of the major delicacies Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town Fagernes, almost three hours of Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a spectacular, snow landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which simply is not to disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, the - depending on how stinkend its fish would like - to a year in water ferments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">If in Norway the darkness of the country and the weather is colder will flock Norwegians, to a celebration here in Fagernes that this, now, really very bestechenden speciality is devoted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">'You it eats raw and carries it then, with a glass aquavit down', says Havard Halvarsen, in fact the local fire station is working, but as a so-called 'Rakfisk-General' the festival.</seg>

<seg id="14">'Mansche people may aquavit more than the Rakfisk,' says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The spirit can smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have some pausing to cost.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it avoids setting Rakfisk to bring in Nasennähe, it is not bad, such as sushi, the bus behind a very long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a quite different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no first and fish in the autumn in luftdichten Salzwasserfässern has been watered.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the deepest winter Fermentierung he was then, after a long and - no doubt, by means of alcohol tempered end - eaten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Even before a generation saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and, mainly in the US.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a prosperous labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even from Sweden, the old rival, not that long ago was much richer than Norway, skilled immigrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk will be seen as something important - as an essential, if strict riechender part of the Norwegian history.</seg>
<seg id="24">He belongs to the more expensive courts, which we can buy here.</seg>
<seg id="25">But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich proud costs EUR 10.</seg>

<seg id="28">Instead, we only refers to the 'incident of 22 July'.</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegian find it difficult to accept that someone in its peace-loving country to such brutal murders is capable of.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">The main responsibility for today ’ s wealth of Norway is since the early 1970 ’ s growth of the largest oil and Gasindustrien the world.</seg>

<seg id="34">We are not very angeberisch, we may not have ostentation.</seg>

<seg id="35">Norway is dealt with its oil wealth very careful - a large part of the Branchenerträge will for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.</seg>

<seg id="3">Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even better days ago, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday was a ring of steel, several important routes in the capital absperrt and on the roads for chaos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The aim was not, however, commuters on the way to work to disrupt demonstrators, but to prevent Parliament to achieve.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, Mexico ’ s new President Enrique Pena Nieto the Präsidentenbinde and the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He is facing a complex task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon ’ s, Mexico, to prove economically well, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, in the last six years has cost 60 000 lives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">'My Administration is strongly committed to the violence to reduce Nieto Pena', said at the beginning of this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he was on an equal footing with the US President, was Pena Nieto as Governor of his Heimatstaats Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this densely populated, rambling part of the country's capital city surrounds the opinions are divided on the new head of state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A direct man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the remote small town Valle del bravo remembered, for example, like to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Inhabitants of Urlaubsorts him write the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to achieve the city, you can drive one of the motorways, the Pena Nieto built and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy streets, here again.</seg>
<seg id="17">With his behalf, badges are also outside of a modern Sportzentrums and of an impressive interactive museum on climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">'We expect real and lasting changes', as his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, as Congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular, regarding the safety and economy is concerned, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox.</seg>
<seg id="21">Congressman Olvera is that the Party after 12 years of outside the Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He was a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was a great statesman, above all, but it is also someone who can listen to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the state do not share this view, many people on their former Governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the paved roads of Valle del bravo not be greater.</seg>
<seg id="27">The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the Community are of crucial urban nature.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the beginning of this year the military was involved in the neighbourhoods, in order to combat drug gangs operating, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In a corner of fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill have been in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murders of women.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the term of Governor Pena Nieto in the state of Mexico have been more than 1,000 women murdered - a statistic which even the city of Ciudad Juarez, for their violence and murders of innocent women is notorious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The critics Pena Nietos believe that it is the problem of feminicide, during his term of office, at least not adequately tackled.</seg>
<seg id="33">But his government in the worst case, have their eyes closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a Betonbau, typical of the run-down neighbourhoods, is fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as I think they are photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows.</seg>
<seg id="35">The official version of events, committed suicide Mariana 2010.</seg>
<seg id="36">But their family believes that it was murdered by their partners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">'When I arrived in their home, it seemed as if their bodies have been washed', remembers Senora Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs that they had been beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already begun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While their mother told their history, has a picture of the wall of Mariana down to us. It is in addition to a cross appropriate that a single word: justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">But it is precisely this, as the family, we have until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The authorities have dealt with me, as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.</seg>
<seg id="42">They want their judgment simply accepted and shut up.</seg>
<seg id="43">'But that is not possible, if there were so many errors and omissions,' says it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">If President Pena Nieto on Saturday, he receives the Präsidentenbinde is also a great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Tens of Mexican families were in the last six years of violent crime, and the new President has promised during his term of office, particularly to attend to this problem.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="46">'I hope, as President, it is as it was as Governor,' says the PRI-Kongressabgeordnete Olvera in Valle del bravo.</seg>

<seg id="1">My mexikanisch-amerikanische identity crisis.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Many people are given the lack of opportunities, Mexico forced to leave</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans, the immigrants tend to blame - they call them in difficult times, he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette is the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just the hall running and was reached in the passport, as a dilemma in me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs referred to two queues: one for 'Mexicanos' ('Mexicans'), the other for 'Extranjeros' ('foreigners').</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I was there a few seconds, uncertain, to which I should like to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I am in Zentralkalifornien has been raised and all my life 'Mexicans'.</seg>
<seg id="9">An ethnic acronym - just as my friends in Boston 'Irish' or my friends in New York "Italians'.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, I opted for 'Mexikanisch-Amerikanisch'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the home of my grandfather's there was no need for acronyms or hyphenation.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simply Americans.</seg>
<seg id="14">I am speaking Spanish, at least well enough to me in this language at both ends of interviews to say.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American emphasis I will also not happening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Therefore, I took my American passport and asked me in the queue for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought this week on the moment when the future President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House, in order to meet President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda of all those issues which we expect, if the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that Mexicans today, with just as likely to remain in Mexico, rather than emigrating to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and a North American trading bloc for example of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And he swore Pena Nieto Mexico, the war against the drug cartels to continue, even if he no details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mexico ’ s relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans have probably never waste a single idea that the United States in 1848 invaded in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem rifle forced them to more than half of their territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans in centuries, and not in Minutes think, are memories of this event not to overlook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore, once a US-Regierungsbeamter only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - of complaints, as the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children Montezumas is leaving for the war-path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet is the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inclination, resentment to speak?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio live, is that on a point in our family tree of a person - perhaps a parents' associations or Großelternteil - no chance in Mexico needed, and towards North immigrated.</seg>
<seg id="32">And in most cases this person was a profile - brown-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are the offspring of these people, and our allegiance to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And although we now live perhaps the American dream, good schools have visited and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is clearly the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, we are aware that many Members of the Mexican ruling class may not.</seg>
<seg id="39">This is based on reciprocity.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a monument a humiliating defeat and look to us, because we are not mexikanisch enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never good enough, our relations with Mexico never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">Their opinion, is a symbol of the failure of our existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If not our families in Mexico, they would not have failed.</seg>
<seg id="44">And then we would not now caught behind the Seidenvorhang see - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child einwanderte legally in the United States, I am reminded that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take it for them.</seg>
<seg id="46">While it is American citizen, it feels as part of two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">But many Mexican Americans, who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the Mexican bond Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen song come.</seg>
<seg id="49">It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we will be seen as the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">As I should learn during my trip, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: some of the Mexican leaders and parts of the Bildungsbürgertums wish to resume their links to the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to Mexican Americans as a provisional 'ambassador' for Mexico, their interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American colleagues of them as to how great a visit this country is, and pressure on the political leadership, to intensify their ties with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Now.</seg>
<seg id="56">This will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many wounded feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And in view of the unfair distribution of incomes, the rampant corruption and the Drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I fear that, alone with their cronies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">That is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans not yet ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico and a half centuries, they must also accept that some of the Mexican Americans have a resentment for their family members, as only not so long ago have been treated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are 'Mexican', as I thought.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Old battles, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be unexpected cornerstone for the peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Is it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the midst of the usual blame countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and killed six Israelis - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli city in Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But, while the Israelis and Palestinians trapped in their historic conflict seems, is changing the Middle East around them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are reasons to believe that the lethal stalemate could at last find its end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war that is not yet lost</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, optimism, given the current situation anything other than appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the on 21 November agreed cease-fire lasts, the week's fighting the tough-minded on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement, which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis to have reduced, even though his group has even large losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although some of the leaders and killed 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel until now, have not managed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, the Hamas in the West Bank, which of the rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah is controlled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that the time they have on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">So, as Islamists in the Arab world to have influence, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends can draw on their side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, the once as Israel ’ s closest Muslim ally has taken for Hamas Party - like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheerful Hamas-Anhänger believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power on Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren stamp before the Stürzung Bashar ’ s, to Jordan, where Hamas-Verbündete the King.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - far and away the einwohnerstärksten and most important Arab country - from the southern flank of Israel has greatly altered the balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the secular tyrant, Egypt, until his fall 2011 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders more dependent on Volksansichten.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic negotiations could prove to be the Hamas as a player, even by Israel and the United States are not excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Israeli hardliners, however, let the opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">In military terms, Hamas is no risk more.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome ', has to prove and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">At least for a while Israel will can sleep more easily.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in its position. Many European countries have the Hamas Gewalteskalationen made responsible for the latest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Israel is there in recent years is good, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, of the peace process has largely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although rockets from Gaza since 2004, around 30 Israelis have killed, is the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the security wall has, in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. This protect hineinverlaufen the Jewish settlements, which is to have been declared illegal under international law, but always be developed further.</seg>
<seg id="31">Netanyahu is good because. His Likud Party has in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, with a more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, allied kämpferischeren group.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why these hinterlistigen Palestinians and a nanny state of their own devices?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they actually the control of the West Bank, they would then have not just as their allies in Gaza also firing of rockets?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, it is better to have them behind the wall at bay and punish, they should dare to the heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps it will be able to enforce the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could offer them a case of.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists, who now in Egypt and in other countries are little for Israel, they will begin with the difficulties in their own country.</seg>
<seg id="37">The taken by Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="38">A war with the local superpower the new Arab governments will hardly help in the restoration of their economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust to achieve a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Even Israelis should long-term thinking.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which is undoubtedly one day in the Israeli occupied territories will explode, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv to explode.</seg>
<seg id="42">The repression undermines already the democracy of the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bloody missions for the eradication of the Hamas in Gaza over the years of increasingly its diplomatic toll.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a boost from outside</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The right answer is that which the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two states, in which Israel's security areas.</seg>
<seg id="46">The small - for the near future - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar stop the flow of arms in the Gaza Strip and is better placed than ever before, the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a common Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Outsiders Arab nations should also the Hamas and Fatah move to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="49">That would be more to the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the forthcoming request for UN-Beobachterstatus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Obama must also play its part, Israel to negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term of office, he failed to the presentation of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is as a participation reluctant.</seg>
<seg id="53">But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States have a major interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is good, also to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours in the airport, as our aircraft operated by mechanical problems and we have had to wait another aviators.</seg>
<seg id="3">I therefore had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I do not lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait, is quite nervtötend - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, steuerfreies shopping) are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But still more academics and boredom Kindesentwicklungsexperten lead as something positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">If they are concerned, it is for us - and our children - well, sometimes to be bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the brain, be forced to lose in interesting line of reasoning, which may the creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because the majority of us today, almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, are the benefits of boredom not more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The boredom we should therefore welcome with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">I will come back again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">How many people also, I am always assumed that boredom a relatively recent phenomenon that is with growing leisure has developed.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, Mr Peter Toohey, Professor for Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of 'Boredom: a Lively History' (Yale University Press 2011), it is not so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'In fact the boredom a very long history', he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Hauswände Pompejis ziert a Latin graffiti on boredom, on the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">John D. Eastwood associated, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that, defined and boredom in many ways been discussed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After long reading Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of almost 100 people were Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, 'a satisfactory activity, but that does not want to be able to define'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person concerned is not, however, this would like to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Schlüsselerfahrung the boredom, he says, in a "disturbance of Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time only slowly passes'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Thus boredom can almost as to listen to such as depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions are bored people could see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we believe that we have is dull, even if we merely difficulties, we have to focus.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its study 'The Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention - German, for example:' The inert minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention ', which in September in the journal' Perspectives on psychological Science 'appeared, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment with the participants a bond listen to which a person a Magazinartikel read.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard a resounding channel from the neighbouring area, which nothing to do with the content. Others had heard it at the lower volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group these noises not heard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Those who gave barely recognisable television echoes of boredom, more than the other two groups - to feel they have had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If an attempt at a difficult or arduous task, the disruption to focus attention on boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated Professor for neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">However, if you a dreary work - 'as the search for defective products on a Fabrikförderband can distract, music and help, not to feel bored'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even combat by people can remain physically more attentively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">'studies have shown that children who herumhampeln, must learn more and more information than those who keep stillsitzen be forced to', as Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">All of us will eventually boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender, loudspeakers particularly ermüdender film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people bore more easily than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">In order to measure these differences, advanced researchers in the 1980 ’ s a 'scale to Langeweileanfälligkeit'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On the scale are statements such as' For many things that I have to do and are repeating monotonously 'and' I have many interests, that I do not have enough time for all '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Through these scales, researchers found that more girls than boys boring, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, what the need for more and a greater diversity of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general are teenagers a fairly abgespannter bunch.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager kontaktierte.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and to do the homework were bored, whereas 23% said that to be bored, if they were not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">But only 3% of the parents gave, bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson say today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increase or decrease.</seg>
<seg id="44">He was sure, however, that 'the young people is seen as particularly boring, mainly because children and teenagers no great influence on their Alltagsablauf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Back then to my Ursprungsfrage: is boredom healthy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it brings people extreme physical risks and the gambling or drugs, in order to alleviate them - the studies have shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and authors of the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, the issue for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">'With the boredom wants the brain a say that we should do something else, Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain do not know what it is always the best should do.</seg>
<seg id="50">If a boring and these energy is used to play and Gitarre to cook, will be happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">But in the short term for Glücksgefühle television can ensure that these fizzle but again in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">His bored child who is therefore an iPad, can be diverted from boredom. It has not learned however, in order to maintain or to control, says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And he adds: 'self-regulation is transferred from a situation on the other'.</seg>
<seg id="54">The baby learns not only to maintain, but is also in other areas more self-regulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">We should also see it not be too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead, our aim should be to us and outside of the permanent Aktivitäts- Technologieberieselung at ease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">'It is so often, as we should be boring. But boredom, the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful', he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">He believes that the people in reality only after a way forward, and less so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">'In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to deal with it, even if the noise is dead.'</seg>

<seg id="1">In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new Marihuanagesetz</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The 19-jährige Community College-Student and footballers Anthony Orozco is in the south-east Colorados for a crime to justice in this state, which soon will be legally: the possession of some less Marihuanabrocken and a tune with which he these rauchte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Orozco, he and some friends in a Septembertag with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas, as they were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officers marijuana, was found in the car Orozco for the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien appear - Kavaliersdelikte, each with a fine of $100 is - and has received a court hearing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">'We are being treated like criminals', so Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is also a?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities of marijuana to legalise the case, the answer depends in hundreds of smaller takes less by law, as the site.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of minor in marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the similar measures approved, has already dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police authorities pursue 21 years no longer for property in a small scale. This is legally permitted, once the new laws in the next few weeks to come into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced, existing Marihuanadelikte people are still pursuing and quote in court.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, several cities vote in favour of the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains, and new, state licensed Marihuanageschäfte to the opening in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">'This situation is developing so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next,' says Mr J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, the East of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Regulators and also in the state of Washington scratch are perplexed at the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are waiting for a guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of drugs - and we have a deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Washington is one of the view that Colorado in any case, the majority of States is what the regulation of marijuana. There was the drug only for medical purposes, and then Eigenkonsum legalised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore good for the orientation', says Mr E. Smith, the spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for spirits in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Smith also that there is no place or system can do more, as in terms of gross guide to serve.</seg>
<seg id="18">'We have no real precedent, which we can follow', he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law called I-502, on 6 December in force and is thus also the conclusion of a grey area in which the State licensing system is not yet exist, but the possession has legalised.</seg>
<seg id="20">And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be clarified - in this time around, as the state imposition of a 'fair access' lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften around 300 metres in schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">'nowhere more difficult, it will be a location for to find a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in Seattle Ballungsgebiet', says Ben Livingston, the spokesperson for the 'Center for Legal cannabis', a group of scholars recently formed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21 November, Chief Oates his staff in Aurora an e-mail he said that the public prosecutor would smaller Marihuanadelikte in people no longer follow on 21 years, and that the police 'immediately' not identified for these crimes will strive for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates added that the police to urban guidelines for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana will prevail and drug traffickers continue to be pursued.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">In the north County Weld Colorados represents Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken buck a stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he gave to his authority would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly in order to persuade consumers to the withdrawal.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">'Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements, where the crime was' Tatzeitpunkt buck, in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana-Initiative ambivalent.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of Landkreises shows adults, for the possession of small quantities no longer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Bezirksstaatsanwalt Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided to add, however, not all outstanding Besitzverfahren fall.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">'I do not believe that I think that wastes time, to enforce the law, to change', he says.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="32">While 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure was already clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the contradictory reactions in the whole state encouraged by local officials a fundamental dilemma with regard to the big green experiment.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the Justice Ministry is going to give in.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas the Federal Government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to the majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik-Berater the Obama administration is the view that law are probably no doors, in order to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but presumably resist that, under the new legislation legal, publicly regulated Marihuana-Geschäfte to tolerate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Many towns in Colorado not wait for the fact that the federal authorities act.</seg>

<seg id="3">It was always been my greatest dream, a place at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had those university, I once for the largest Wissenstempel the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance -.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">Yet, within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College the end of the 1980s - there I had intended to study, history - I had my suitcase again tackled and so the first scandal of my life.</seg>

<seg id="14">I was only for one reason being harassed - a reason, in this supposed cradle of enlightenment in order to narrow and cruel seemed: my now late father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advisers of Margaret Thatcher, and I advocate of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why do I mention this now?</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, according to recent reports is suffering a new generation of students of the moderate rights under similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The organised and rising hatred on Tory-Studenten in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz last week, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent screened documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right ', the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">It has been demonstrated, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the conservative student Association of Oxford University, in a Rolls-Royce and with silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock protzte.</seg>

<seg id="26">'This is a threat to the intellectual debate and for the well-being of Members', it says.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">In my first weeks in Oxford, I was one such a minority.</seg>

<seg id="1">The cause of a death because AIDS is today a late diagnosis</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Mr Fabrizio was 21 years old, when he was confirmed the outcome: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">'It was as if a bomb hit', he says about the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible sign of success' tried to '.</seg>
<seg id="4">He hidden it before his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to itself to his illness and has begun to take care to be informed; and this with such commitment that he has just celebrated its 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV-Einheit of the hospital patients of the Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after many struggles in 1994.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mr Fabrizio live with the humane Immundefizienz-Virus (HIV) for 22 years, which initially of the 1990s, as it was difficult to imagine many doubts, few treatment and more stigmas.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time avoiding even the director of a clinic of IMSS to adopt, because 'it in a dead end.'</seg>
<seg id="9">At that time was synonymous with AIDS death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today, it is possible, this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, still many people in the hospital, who know nothing of their illness and in which the virus has already damage and their immune system has exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases' means of the great success today that the survival of the treatment of patients, in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same ', said the head of the HCG HIV-Einheit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information in April this year by a reputable scientific publication has been based.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the year 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence is that, but the years of the survival and the quality of life by the degree of prejudice to the immune system of the people at the beginning of the treatment, and that those who depended have greater opportunities, which are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a sort of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a sort of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, the above, mean that anyone in the age of 25 years the diagnosis are HIV-positive, in this sense, "can be easily 75 years old, as long as he is under control ', said this expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to correct this progress must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today, on average, 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS by 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in the year 2011 (annual ONUSIDA)), it is nevertheless true that since the appearance of the AIDS 60% of the national database that patients have died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until the month of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, rest assured that it, since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral medicines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- Why are therefore still people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- In my opinion, is not the problem of access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the past 12 years ago we had no problems in the case of medicines. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their Infektionszustand, i.e. in a very late stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He makes a resounding statement: 'Nine of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection in order to be able to influence global mortality two diagnoses are needed, which is why all people, where necessary, must be offered screening tests'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This proposal are the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state Committee to AIDS-Vermeidung in Jalisco) and the patients as Mr Fabrizio to its test in a private laboratory has carried out, and this for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite its young age was already in the AIDS-Phase and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything has changed, if you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and would like to hear anything.</seg>
<seg id="26">'If I have to die, then we would rather burst' three times, we say in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The amendment was to towards improvement, I am that drives ernähre, sport and take note of the medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">His parents know today that he had only cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, as everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="30">'I am much, I have an active, but good sex lives, I respect to my health and the other person', is Mr Fabrizio to the agreed to his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco, in order to share with his testimony to encourage those who, today in the framework of global AIDS-Tages fear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">They should make the test, if they are vulnerable. The sooner they know whether they are positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live as all the people responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens, there are great holes, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV has adopted.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the most important thing is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">In this specific places', the distribution of condoms actually increased; previously they were issued individually, now give us packages with a hundred piece of what is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom ', he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">To the Risikopersonen for new infections include the young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">'What need you?' is a widespread Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal in schools, social workers, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, the young people are not want to suspend, assured the correspondent.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested that these inefficient distribution of condoms to orient; the new should not only behind the counter, but in Ausgabegeräten in public toilets of institutions, often of young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not the promiscuity be encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="41">They are not the beer and Motel be paid, as the governor Emilio González on the question of whether, under his administration condoms would be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="42">'sexuality is not enough; it is the best use of condoms, to bring it closer to those already in a sexual activity', he brought it to the point.</seg>

<seg id="13">And then, I am with the championship in 1981, the year of Debüts of Jerome Mincy in BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From then took 'Cuco' Ortiz, a very good administrator was, 'says Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I remember that genes Bartow me here, as a trainer worked and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big players.</seg>
<seg id="16">You do unto him? '</seg>
<seg id="17">And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, Puerto Rico has ever had.</seg>
<seg id="18">Subsequently the recommended Bartow Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, and go through naturalisation Werfer was one of our best.</seg>
<seg id="19">I know, as he said that if a championship Mincy for Bayamon, Gausse for a further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">With the championship the Vaqueros Gausse he was granted, but from a distance in 1988, because it already at the top of the Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">At this time, he drew its application and the of Mincy to enjoy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when the first time, we in the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the US won.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the World Cup in 1990, the fourth place in which we showed what actually bronze ought to be, if not the Canadian referee of us would have been the last Spielzug the second time, said Reyes repeated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This group of the World Cup was in 1990, the best national team, which you have ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is one of the best, as well as those which, in the 2004 Olympics against the dream team won.</seg>
<seg id="26">My favourite is but the team of panamerikanischen Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we gold and the team of the US won a battle, as then, as they are against us in the World Cup bronze won.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Robert Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz) once again, but also the young players (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the Brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, the 1990, for a Knieverletzung not been able to be present.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team, which perhaps in terms of figures was not the best, but with which we won a gold medal us great pleasure and the country, was that of the 1995 in Neuquén vorolympischen tournament ’ s, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players such as' Canito 'Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blockage of players because of the events in the Panamerikanischen Games in Mar del Plata, any prediction, we got to the gold medal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best players of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level so as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this without his career in the various leagues into account, in which he has played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a difficult issue.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a number of good coach as Julio Toro, flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of the boys like the work of Leo Arill well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What is the best glaubst you what you have achieved in the Association of?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 until 1995, which initially BSN the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What remains for you to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">The boys in Ponce for example only play in their territory and only in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today, the children needlessly many visits and Games.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least, I see the result of the prescribed and training courses for coach, Tisch-Offizielle and referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">I am proud of.</seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id="48">I hear music, like to see my time in videos of music enjoy my grandchildren and YouTube, and I am a Basketballspiel.</seg>
