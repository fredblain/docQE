After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the group of Vitro, which has been achieved by a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a sinister precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country, which has payment problems.
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements have no validity.
In practice on 15 June recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale on the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas, the Mexican companies are subject to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, the door to call for three inconsistencies of the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge of the matter that lenders must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, says the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, first, that the is the main proceedings for the trade in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in the event of companies with trans-national profile is not known.
In fact, was created to this end, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, with the American law Institute was used as a mediator.
Secondly, the ruling determined that without the votes of the companies for recognition of the in the bankrupt estate the branches of Vitro, with its parent company, the majority needed for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have achieved.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies) were confirmed by.
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the voices of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had, would not have a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, there is Vitro debt for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the economic crisis in the United States, which has been in the country.
For this reason, the family González Sada before the same court of appeal, so that the vote takes place in the house, by all the judges, because only three of them.
It is not the, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious in this case is that the court had a document, which was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura an amicus curiae (friend of the court), where the procedure by Vitro is described in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, and that is pointed out that it had to the agreement signed by both countries to respond to Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It is also pointed out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, that the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantees equality of debtors and creditors.
