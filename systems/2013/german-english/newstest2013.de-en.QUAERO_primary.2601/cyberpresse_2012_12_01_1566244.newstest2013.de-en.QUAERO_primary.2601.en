The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the possible discovery of the has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that the boson is nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And, finally, it is the last of the standard model particle whose existence - our best or the least wrong "explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - has been observed, but not predicted by.
But for physicists, it is not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the standard model Higgs boson.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data yet to be completely secure.
We assume that it is indeed the Higgs is wrong, because apparently only a small risk to, and let us look at what is at stake.
There is an inevitable law that in this world that can be two objects at the same time, in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not to, because you are hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles can occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same quantum state "," and "on the whole, consists of some of its properties.
The physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are referred to as and the Pauli principles.
And in the other the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, whom nothing is sacred, not in any case, this principle, which means that they can indeed be at the same time, at the same place.
These bosons are divided according to the website the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Mesonen, which we will not deal with here and the "," the great forces of nature and the Higgs boson, which would be.
It must be stressed, however, that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the photon, or light particles, "the" messenger "of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electric charge accelerates or change the direction of, the electromagnetic field is in this place "disrupted" like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
In this "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "of the force."
More stable field
The same is true for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, must be "disrupted" Higgs field, so that the boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface could be a very large rocks spall.
That is why a giant particle accelerator is - as CERN's Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - In order to achieve the kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
It is not, in fact, all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - for example, a piece of paper would never in the refrigerator.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the other (such as the photon) have no mass.
What all this research can be "good", asks Mrs Plamondon?
For the science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the to.
There are many physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference to open a door to a "new physics" and could fill some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings, there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (again ups!).
However, the CERN such deviations were not found until now.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and even in 1962, the first (were the first gepulst) - has already said that the laser at the beginning, rather than a "laboratory gimmick".
Imagine...
In addition, there are also from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in optics, has developed a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose of the sensor is now all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...
