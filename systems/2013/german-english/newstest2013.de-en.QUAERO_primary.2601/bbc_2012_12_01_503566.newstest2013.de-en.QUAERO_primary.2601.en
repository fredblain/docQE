Rakfisk from Norway: is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe, but around the world.
Could the secret to the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
It is in the middle of a pile of dirty, humid sports clothing.
And leave it there for a week.
So you have to think about the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you would have stinky fish would like - up to a year in water is fermented.
If the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really.
"You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk general" also organized the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take large quantities of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Harvard.
The Spirituose can crowd out the smell.
I eat a.
If it avoids the Rakfisk in, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling and fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In the deepest winter, he was taken out after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol.
A generation ago thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who not long ago was far richer than Norway, are immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive meals, which you can buy here.
But here, it is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that.
Here you hate it still, to name Anders Breivik - those racist right-wing extremist, who last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in the country.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien since the early 1970s, the growth of the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are so good," says Anna, our waitress, with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes, the round trays with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are, as they say, prudent people.
Her English is just like that of most people here.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry for the benefit of future generations is invested in a special fund.
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis all threw money around, that they do not have anything, Norway closed its wallet.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk eat," she adds with easy laughter.
I am standing in the snow and ask for another court, I have had enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is something else. The juicy meat mundet me.
But in the evening, on the menu.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several locations that, which can organise a Rakfisk Dinner, where guests for the best - or perhaps the sense of smell the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit with a fly to show master, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor Jürgen?"
"Are our points,."
Applause and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish.
