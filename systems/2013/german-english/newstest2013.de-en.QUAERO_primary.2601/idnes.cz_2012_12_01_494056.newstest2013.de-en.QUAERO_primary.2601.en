The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional court of the law on charitable work.
That decision in a lively discussion in the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free, free movement of private capital, with rampant financial speculation goes hand in hand.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions.
Under this concept is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper goods in economic competition, "in order to grab a larger market share by the competition" and to increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Private capital is no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rise in unemployment caused, the government spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that, the men are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are here.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words: governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
This is done through economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by the rights of workers.
The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are for several years, public food distribution for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people who are already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive such low wages that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of the German Bundestag auxiliary staff employed in the.
The austerity measures of practically all eu southern states will be on the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate, under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels (as in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society, and to hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here is the question of where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam, that the state should not be capital in its own economy, and that a planned economy will lead to economic disaster.
The private capital is on his position that the state should not interfere with in the economy.
Then you have to wonder whether or not the private capital, the policy, and the entire state in its own selfish sense or even.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual unmistakably, practically everything in the legislation, but nothing is punishable by law.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department for lack of finance private, dense with industry of with the development of law.
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag.
All the violence is no longer from the people, as the western nations, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies have been in a situation that the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and ': "the state has long been in decay, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, illegal bequiles of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption has grown, and the people with already bought votes went to the polls... "" people with character not applied for as a result of this decline for eight months, so that the state had no consul... "" you really began to talk about it, that is the only medicine an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man... "Appian thought to be elected, but the strong man was, democracy permanently replaced by the.
As it turns out, today's society is based, as well as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, not paying attention to the interests.
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to see the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are, not in the slightest for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we must in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The current state of affairs, the of these regimes can be seen as a certain pause in favor of liberal democracies, in the next round.
The is the fact that today's elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution, at least not lasting.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the level of social security of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in the company in favour of the state.
