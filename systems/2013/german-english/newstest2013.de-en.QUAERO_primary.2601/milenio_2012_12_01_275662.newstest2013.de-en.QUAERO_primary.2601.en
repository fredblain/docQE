The cause of death due to AIDS is now too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to go to his illness and began to inform, and this with such dedication that He has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s was difficult to see how many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, it avoided even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
But many people in the clinic, who know nothing about their illness and the virus has already caused damage and has exhausted her immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 inferred that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life the degree of impairment of the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that would have greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that, at the age of 25 years who gets diagnosed HIV positive, in that sense, "can easily be 75 years old, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS, from cases in 2007 to in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), it is true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of of the patients have died in the national database.
In the year 2011 255 people died in Jalisco, and the month of May this year there are 187 deaths since 2005, but assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- Why so people are still dying?
- In my opinion, is not the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of drugs. The problem is that the people in an advanced state, because they do not know their infection, in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a powerful statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, and that is why all the people, where it is massive screening tests must be offered."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (national committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio, who was already carry out its test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age in the AIDS stage, and even the Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and do not want to hear.
"If I have to die, then it is three times burst," said, in my case.
The change was to improve, I ernähre well, and take the medication.
Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I am a lot, I have an active, but responsible, I am to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio, which agreed to share intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, to encourage those who have with his testimony today in the context of the global AIDS day.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
"In certain places, the distribution of condoms was actually increased;, they were, now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The risk for new infections among young people.
"What do you need?" Is a widespread derision question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to expose the correspondent.
He proposed to this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but output devices in public toilet facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not enough; it is the best way to bring the closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 and 1,317 HIV).
The state is seen in 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, 6% of the blood and 2%.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are for every registered case 4 or 5 people who do not know It.
