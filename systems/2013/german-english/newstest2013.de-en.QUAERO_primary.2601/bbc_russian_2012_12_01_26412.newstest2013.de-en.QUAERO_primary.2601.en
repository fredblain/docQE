In the past few days, there have been the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to, or whether they are out of the again soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-profit organizations.
In addition to the increase In the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday in the United States took place, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to Handgemengen.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targets individuals with people of low and.
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores is, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees on the work.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart, one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say Walmart can sell the goods are often so cheaply, because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of serious conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution to the health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns 9.5 dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That is about 1.1% more than they now pay.
If Walmart, the wage increases would pass on to customers, each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
They compared to this would be a year for additional spending of just 12.39 dollars.
Advocates of Walmart note with satisfaction that it was only in nine states to protests and no losses to the company.
The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
All in all, the on "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington post that a "less than five" Walmart employees work, and the protest is only "another PR stunt," the union, which organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests this week in New York, where their does not, however, Walmart stores (which are not in this progressive city, and that is why so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billions of chickens, and yet you granted no sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is in accordance with federal and New York legislation 7.25 dollars an hour.
The minimum wage will be increased gradually in fast food restaurants, but not too much, and on average, get their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars an hour.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's stood behind the counter, but the young people were living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw this as the main source of income, or planned to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's, people who complain that they have to feed this wage and sometimes even their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper the Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you didn't know how to eat.
The participants in the protests, which on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks from fast food restaurants a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits the to stand in the way of this objective and union members to admonish or.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
The protests on this day, there were many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon before the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including city Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billions of chickens, and yet you granted no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast food workers so that they can achieve a fair wage and economic prosperity every New Yorker!."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, which is far from all of them are employed in the fast-food industry, in the work in New York tens of thousands.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole mass.
