"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activist, the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals are already with fake certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to make money for the upkeep of the remaining families in the home.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every migrant labor, a test of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing and retail.
But the tests are to be over time, according to the migration authority for all migrant workers in the future.
It is not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must be established for the preservation and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
There are Also exempt from this law, people who have received their training certificates and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, and the protection of the rights issue
The whole of the will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of people, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants will be able to take the tests in all cities; now, have already opened more than 160 such centers were in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the federal immigration authorities.
Civil rights activist, on the whole thing, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press, the following question: what does it actually mean?
What changes to the, language skills, both for the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, spokesman for the migration authority, it is to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representation of the federal immigration authorities in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights, however, must be protected before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment to 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.
On the problems migrants without jobs, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably encounter people with bad intentions, which is under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he met with dozens of his peers months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day.
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you one thing, and on arrival, you have been cheated In their passports and do not receive the promised wages," the head of the labour migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
It is not, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, too, that they do not know not only the language of the country, but also in their own language to express in writing.
Of course, that is not so much their fault, but rather the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can only afford a sound basic education.
In their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy decent clothes, shoes and school.
As a teenager, these children then immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills,".
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists say the following important aspect of the law.
The test only migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "forbidden access to banned"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, The linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalisation of costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents and we are not registered, and then to cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Spare no expense for false papers."
On the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some counterfeit certificates, the completion of the language tests, have already been by members of the federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant, who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a three thousand rubles.
That is the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates can be bought, both officials and civil rights activist.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers, who are covered by the test for the first time, that you get time for a language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills will be offered in areas where no active communication with people.
