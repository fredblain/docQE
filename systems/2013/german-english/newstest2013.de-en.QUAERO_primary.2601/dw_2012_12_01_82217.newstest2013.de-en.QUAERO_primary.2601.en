Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, with Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Germany now has to be careful, however, because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it came to set up a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, enforced by NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
That is because it is from his foreign policy, away from a policy that were managed by the United States, a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are in the.
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think of their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different from those of the other major powers, to a certain extent, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have an impact on the in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful not to alienate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, which plays a role.
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by the important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic collapse, as in the Libyan issue.
Maybe Germany will even some respect.
Because it signals that it must be taken into account as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States have called for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of American domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can not represent this position publicly, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all, are we talking about Netanyahu's policies.
It is difficult to Germany, its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side?
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and have instead things from their own position.
They are with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a leading role?
Germany is still the lead or?
Germany is still not used to it, that is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time Germany takes on a greater role in various anti-German feelings.
That does not make it easy for the Germans.
This is the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics, not the EU fills the vacuum at the moment but who is?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like them, it is unpleasant, and it is Even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
