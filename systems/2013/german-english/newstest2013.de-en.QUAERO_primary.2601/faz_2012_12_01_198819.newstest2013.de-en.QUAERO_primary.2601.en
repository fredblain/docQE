"Brand protection" in China: If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original company.
However, as long as it is protection, such as the real name donors do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they get right.
"It will become more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas in the law firm Taylor Wessing,, a lawyer who specializes in patent rights abuses in the Far East.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
The are already a few extra letters, so that they can register their brands.
It is from Gucci, Prada is simply Lu Gucci, Prada.
German companies are legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Standoff hole opens a folder with entries of the Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protecting the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art, a name that the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in the copying and the injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are more-floor department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
, however, there are different: on behalf of its clients, it is the fact that Chinese companies receive officially by the Trademark Office for the right to use a term that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call The "bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This means that women are fish rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
"It is, we must fight it," calls for the.
"The brand is, the position disappears, the damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA is China, with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the register of are hard to reach and go into the money.
The process can drag on for Up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Reports of cases in which the court rejected, because after the long duration of the name of the "market reality."
If the plaintiff have bad luck, he would have to pay the Plagiator even money because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases involving graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction equipment manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker.
The Chinese must use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo, which recalled BMW; the dispute has been resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
The Trademark Office in Beijing CTMO is that there have been 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
But Last year was one of the "emergency position in the workflow returned to normal."
The fallen by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, in the office still 81,500 objections to completion.
On the other hand, to address costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and meant that China, for the 10th time in the list of applications around the world, with the authority.
This also applies to the stock of all the valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million units.
In 2011, has taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
This means that any application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, to address costs many times, as the case of the German company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans were able to achieve its illegal Fabrikation imitation of motor vehicle parts has been.
But the the Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
You have failed, because in Germany could not be protected, "said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the process.
We need to watch
Now, the matter is pending before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and is costing us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could not quantify the company, even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, in a "high six-figure euro amount" on the other side of the settlement.
"You can see how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East, even in Europe.
Then, if there territory.What Doubles vulnerable brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This business, but the company has a long time, he was able to avert the registration.
"You have to watch it," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer advising German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, the foreigners "everything is somehow, in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg In the last act of his trademark drama, then you would have to pay the other side of fees for their own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
