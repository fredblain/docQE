The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head by the example of Spijkenisse, and the mountain - 2 photos
"I find the building fun, it looks futuristic, and finally, there is something interesting to see again," said Lisette Verhaig, a Passantin at the.
And Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby wholesale company, says: "But it is nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is still voluntarily in one of these old style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little town on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is outlandish record holder.
The has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid thing, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to the general education and the seven fictional bridges that are on the euro, as a reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way to the statistics: a library.
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared to the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked nonplussed, and his exquisite souvenirs of the size of the cheeky Maas, a pyramid and ended his speech with the words: "Love."
This is it, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros is expensive.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground car park, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the books with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
It is the faceless city retort, which until now had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, the white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural's in the history of its existence.
The long road to The book
The first impression: books under glass.
There is a lift, through the hills, but the real and reading room at the nearby climbing the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the and the elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and is in the middle of a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have the classic room configuration on the head and the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and.
A special pleasure is the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall panelling,,.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and engineers shake of the unknown building.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen agricultural operation on a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a as root.
That is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two seasons, then it is ready for The rubbish bins.
For the library was pressed the fleece - for the first time in this to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, material, which smells a little for new cars and a little after.
After 105 stages has reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also rewarded with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in literature.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," says.
It Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the book mountain is under a glass of, the sun shines, even on sunny days only briefly in the interior.
The broad, on the glass facade, and a large part of the sun.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Do the rest fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already the way to the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg Spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: The opening of a few weeks ago, everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces - This is to be filled.
The concept is.
The shelves are filled up.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
And if it is only.
This is a MVRDV discipline was called in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
So young and uneducated they may be.
This is a starting point for identity.
