A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center for, the latter is a myth, and that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The attorneys for the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States,, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the united states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, has announced new laws to make it difficult for the procedures for the registration or.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which the new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws that require voters to present photo identification and proof of citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the period for early voting, the to register as voters on election day, and denied citizens the right to vote, for which a court.
Before the elections of 2006, no US state has asked voters to present photo identification.
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in the year 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.
Over the last two years, to in 34 states, which forced the voters to produce photo identification.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to do not unlike Quebec on a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, 21 million people no photo identification issued by a governmental authority of their state.
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to get the required identification.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected low-income young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification.
This goes further.
The students who are seen as voters increasingly cast their votes for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo id issued by The establishment.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs, which is On the Republican side, to the cards issued by these clubs to use for elections.
Before 2004, no state has asked for proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first federal state, who introduced such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly, to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states laws, with the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the voter registration in the 2004 general election to register some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws, which aim to shorten the period for early voting.
For example, in the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance, African-Americans, even though they represent only 13% of voters in the state.
The same is true of the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the White, 76% of the voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
The Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the 2012 key states.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, which make up 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college, in order to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
