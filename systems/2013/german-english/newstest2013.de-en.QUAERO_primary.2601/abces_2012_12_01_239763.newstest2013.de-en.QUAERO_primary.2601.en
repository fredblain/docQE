The most difficult job in the world: the human Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they are 70 kilogram of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day he has to get down on the floor of the crater, where the earth, sulphurous gas in contact with the air.
He stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths made of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, the balance and they must put their steps carefully, so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen volcano.
The Kawah Ijen mine workers earn 5 cents for each kilogram of sulphur, which.
At the top, they pave the path between the tourists like circus monkeys and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (rather) is exploiting its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
They then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life, and is used for the production of woods, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"We are usually 70 kg, we get around 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," explains to us Anto, which makes three routes on the day.
For each track that he needed three hours, according to which he is completely, at the end of the day, but it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day, and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is in Banyuwangi, a village nearby, returned with his family, and for a reason, which is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, often a coughing fit and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto puts his life at the Kawah Ijen volcano for three years on the, whose sulfur already left the first traces of him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, often a coughing fit and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here two years ago, because I open a shop or to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but young man life overregulated could work as a tourist guides, waiters or working on the reception desk of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, and every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur applying at night, where his distinctive yellow color shines in the darkness.
The shadow challenging, in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money into the crater.
About 400 winners are on the crater floor baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has mechanized the sulphur reduction in order to save costs, and the work on their own account and are paid according to weight, no equipment.
You also get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, as well as the of this nature parks, together with the entrance fee of rupees (1.2 euros) demand from the tourists who come to the shooting of the volcano and human.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protested Madrusin, a sturdy, which operates three decades since leaving the school at the Kawah Ijen volcano.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, "as long as it is," because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and eyes, when the wind suddenly and can become trapped mine workers in the thick pillars rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... of course, the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back is Unainik with his 53 years, only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are carried by three trucks on a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
From his five children, the oldest working with his 30 years as sulphur.
Time passes, but the poverty keeps generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who work as human load donkey on the Kawah Ijen volcano.
