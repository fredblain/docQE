Daily drink butter - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year old are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.

A search in the country where 97-year old are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumpelt on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think, would be in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
The Caucasian ethnic group of the, which is not much known, except that it perfectly and Azeri speaks and is very durable.
Last stop is Lerik.
The small town of flaunts to architecture from Soviet times, which does not want in the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists from Europe did not come here is too onerous, the from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 miles you need eight hours, because the road is only one.
The fabulous wealth of the country's oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only one in the world.
The is documented in the area of about eight dozen Talyschen older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years of a child
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, which is expected to be 168 years old.
A birth certificate, but does not exist.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is still a daughter.
It Has Şirali Müslümov at his age for a couple of decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard from the very elderly - in Central Asia.
"A striking number of hochaltrige people is also available in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "live in Sardinia, huge numbers of very old men."
However, due to the lack of documents is no scientific proof of age, especially.
Every day becherweise melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why live in the south so many people?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains with the particular genes of Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is a matter of the other.
But that the high-calorie diet of Talyschen should be healthy meat, bread and milk products, in particular, love, and many of those daily drink a glass of melted butter, from a point of view does not seem plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years for this, it is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the floor with a butter barrel they tirelessly and herrollt.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents.
Two small children.
In the kitchen preparing tea, which is served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu glasses for the guests.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect, hidden under her headscarf, long, dark blonde braids, her son proudly unveiled in front of us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, they never went out and retained their color.
"I have never used," says Mirzayeva shampoo.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always eaten what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food.
It tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyew took over.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva per month as a pension, an amount that you can live well for local conditions, it is possible.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long ergrauter son right: "The old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared for and are happy.
If that is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive
