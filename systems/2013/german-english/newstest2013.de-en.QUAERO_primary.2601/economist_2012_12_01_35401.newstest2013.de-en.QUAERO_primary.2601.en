The Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
There will be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such a hope in The bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations countless buildings were in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation is anything but.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, have strengthened the this week's fighting the on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, to say that the Israelis have pushed back, although his group even suffered heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and corners of the planet, Israel has so far, not to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders might come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a, regional power, which was once known as Israel's closest Muslim ally, Hamas has taken party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren embossing before St√ºrzung Bashar Assad could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And, in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot, who ruled Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be as a player that can't, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
The Israeli hardliners, however, an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is not a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep.
In diplomatic terms, the United States hold their position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has been largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the, which in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements that have been of international law, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with a group.
Why is this cunning Palestinians and left to their own state?
If they had control of the West Bank, in fact, they would not like their colleagues in Gaza, fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish you, they should dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to, But the Arab spring could make them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will focus on the problems in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair its economy.
This pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
The Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg, which will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand increasingly over the years, its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The right answer is that the one of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states, where Israel is for security purposes.
The for the near future small - hope is that the cease-fire gives outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.
Egypt must stop now, together with Turkey and Qatar arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas to the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by the of and a common Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for un observer status.
Obama also needs to do its part to push Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also to participation.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
