Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life."
The organization of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, who was connected to the for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a great intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, was Rexes part of this sport for 6 years, as a player and manager in the lower classes, players of the first national League, agent BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of basketball Association.
"My whole life I have many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, managing director of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and almost all of them.
Bayamón in the heart
The emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the centre of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as a manager or of the club.
"These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a managing director, has been further or coach.
There were many rewarding years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy BSN.
From then took over, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "said Reyes.
I know that I am Gene Bartow, who was here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow recommended that the free throw Proffesionals Raymond Gausse, and was one of our best shooter.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had made a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but even from a distance, because he was already 1988 at the top of the association.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, in which we the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if not the Canadian referee had been the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
This group was the 1990 World Cup, the best national team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who the that won 2004 Olympics against the Dream team.
My favorite is the team the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and the team of the United States offered a fight, as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities, not the best, but we won a gold medal and was a great pleasure to those of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won against all the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
There was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking account of his career in the various leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We have had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the best, What you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in one season.
What remains to be done to you?
There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and only in the national playoffs teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children of many unnecessary trips and games.
At least I can see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches, officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you do?
I like to listen to music, watch videos, music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
