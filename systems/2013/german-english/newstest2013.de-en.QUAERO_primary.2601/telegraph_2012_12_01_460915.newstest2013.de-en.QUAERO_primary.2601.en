Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am Tory
Not only university students today are being attacked for her views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought was the largest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance -.
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College at the end of the - I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I would have had a problem with fellow students in the adjacent room had sex.
The author of A N Wilson said, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had harassed me for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment: my late father now Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to latest reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week, the same equal protection of gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College, they are often actively isolated because of their political views "personally attacked and declared undesirable."
They are calling for a place in the equality of their college, in order to ensure that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Joe Cooke, a former president of the conservative student association has been shown, among other things, It was of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls Royce and with silver suit and.
At other universities say conservative students, they are as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative Students of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing tendency to universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon club, without us to at all. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the conservative student association of Oxford says she watched with, members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was part of a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I had arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the Last year, the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student - as a result of cuts in higher education to give title.
The atmosphere would have been even Stalinists.
In the first days of the week, get to know the new students and tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors mockery of Tory students not only tolerated, but even with joy.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English. What should have been, I was not taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are you just stupid?" He asked me.
The other students.
In my eyes wallten tears.
"I suggest that you take a few French hours in your free time, if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned with h√§ngendem head in my room.
On this evening, I sat alone in the college at the dinner when someone typed me slightly on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being a Tory,.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse For you.
Most Tory, to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I later tried to distract me.
I insisted that I was not entirely agree with Mrs Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A number of new entrants in philosophy, politics and economy, which had visited as a conservative force, ironically, the Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"As the Tories have sex?" Asked me one.
The beat each other, right?
I felt so as homosexuals had to have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States.
I Would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
I would like to meet like-minded people only after nightfall?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me, I extended to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who as a Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
It was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he said.
I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
This is something like that they would never do in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners.
Tarnished his moist eyes.
A chance.
I am sure you neckt.
It would break my heart if you were walking.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, in which claimed another history tutor seriously, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly in shame, I admitted that my parents to a "brainwashing" and called them "old sucker."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who was the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave my persecutors.
As they went, I was a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weinerlichen wimp.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And it is tragic that it was an university of Oxford, who did not only 14 Tory prime Minister, but until now hidden behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
