Other officials of the road Administration have admitted that they were, by the bills artificially with false additional services by 30-40%.

On the basis of a 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak simulacrum of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, according to what he would change nothing in the situation: "as long as the election campaign spending will not be strictly limited, black money in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public contracts and the financing of the parties: "we cannot fall deeper; to the things with courage, we can build the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
