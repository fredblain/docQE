Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was as a member of the European Space Agency at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which took place on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994 close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and took part in the following years several ESA projects.
The path of Poland into space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War Polish space in the space, and they do not always met with understanding.
I would remind you of the lecture by A. Šternfeld 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, for example, in which the author thought from his pioneering work "entrance to the Outer Space Exploration."
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905), the audience cold, and after years ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the Outer Space Exploration" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been by, among other things, that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
In the year 1925 in Poland, a railway trolley was built, a rocket was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or the brakes of the trolley.
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with.
The research, the Institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear From the documents show that the research was to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, appeared in the press of the draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, the "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology from the scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work by his work was the beginning of the war.
Another article on space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrt (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in which four major articles devoted to the space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains The proposal to set up a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.
At its inception in 1956, the PTA Polish aerospace company founded in 1951 to join the International Federation for space, and indeed, in the autumn of 1956, the PTA was already.
In the following year became the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
The office he held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA took part in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built, and 1959 in the bledowska desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should be able to provide real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and come for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, but the development has been.
Successor to the first missiles of the type RM was developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and The weight was 32.5 kg.
This has developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which are from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area with 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude of all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg, at a height of about 60 km.
The versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, after two years later, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in the space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second.
