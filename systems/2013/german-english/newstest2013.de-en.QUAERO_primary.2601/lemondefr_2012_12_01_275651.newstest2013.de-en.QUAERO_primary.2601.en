"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have a new deal with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players.
Every day I am on their side.
The technical staff gave me a lot.
These factors spur me every day to improve my game.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football, everything is going very quickly.
But I must stop in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my game time at Saint Etienne I have always made gradual progress.
They make the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.
The new entrants this summer are used to make a very high levels.
They also know that every training session.
This means that a player like me, the forehead and wants to give his best.
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my game.
It is supported by other such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti breathes all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches In Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
The trust that he has put in me, it is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season for PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the us.
We are in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the World Cup in this way.
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our say, a very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the First of our group in Porto, so that we can deliver the return leg of the final home game.
The PSG can become a major European club in the short term?
He has already in the budget for it...
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win the title and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financial resources, so that this project is taking shape.
It would be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really important to us, the of This title.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested, and the players we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
If we win, with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us, that is frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game plan.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, fails to qualify for the final, and also has made huge spending.
In terms of the sums invested was believed to break with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season of this new PSG were good, "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better that you speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals.
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This inspires others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is also one of the world's best defenders, allowing everyone to make progress.
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was to take part in this European championship.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from being able to some game time.
I saw things that I am stronger.
Today, I will be able to achieve good games in the national team.
This was my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and to the victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved its goal, he had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps, the "Bleus" will lead to Brazil.
The forced draw on 16 October in Spain (1: 1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
