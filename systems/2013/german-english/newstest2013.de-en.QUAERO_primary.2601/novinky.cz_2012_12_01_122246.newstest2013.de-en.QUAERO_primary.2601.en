Guidelines for the balloons, bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the oddest of bank charges, this year, has decided to hold the "most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"This idea brought us the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are objectively less of a risk for the insurance companies.
"More incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol belongs to fuel, which is in its aftermath, the ban on the mercury thermometer, just because they a relatively small amount of this, or the directive on size of chicken cages, because of the eggs this year were much more expensive.
The criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm
The EU machine, often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in the rule of one or more member countries in Brussels (Czech Republic is currently trying example, to do with veto threat to the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind it, that bananas of the highest trade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and no "of."
The European Commission defended with the argument that it is only the fragmented national standards that would impede trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries already have been softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, which according to balloons in the sale must be with that children under eight years of the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU, citing an American study, which are in accordance with balloons in the is the leading cause of children.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious incursions at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that the European officials - anyone who has an official role in the EU,, which use the name Macedonia, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez faire nominated in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, in the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU has set the maximum volume of food supplies, which is on the day of our accession to the EU membership in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic, for example, exceeded The volume of canned mushrooms, for which threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them that they do not have a sea, or from the idea to provide funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, however, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will be asking for a refund from the EU, "said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
The argument that the grain harvest was very high, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded government camps.
The Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay according to Palas hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered communities the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically for the establishment of aid money should be funding requests to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
The target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, hence, effectiveness and the development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, more recognition in the member States.
A serious problem, according to these experts are more EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in with the deepening of European integration, which were in the budget negotiations by individual member states.
Emotions that the fact that the Czech Republic must fight like other member countries in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win in this country.
The Czech Republic could to after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the local rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us in the 19th century, but had to change our manufacturers, "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU in the company of the feta cheese, Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham biscuits, carp from Pohořelice and and now, or even the Žatec hops.
With an can boast the gingerbread or Hořicer roles.
