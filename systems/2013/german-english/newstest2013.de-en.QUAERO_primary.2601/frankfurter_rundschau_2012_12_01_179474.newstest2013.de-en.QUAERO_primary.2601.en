Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is to be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water there, as well as from three studies published on Thursday in the in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence of the fact that there is an ice in the region of the planet permanently in the shadow.
This is supposed to be at least 30 cm and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that are on The Mercury.
No one put the discovery of ice, but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to resolve such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the world's citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small in.
The image comes from a camera, the German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.

Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope will have been invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei began a year later to star observation.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescopes ever greater, and the insights they provide deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It can gaze into space on two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror is to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, it has a diameter of 11 metres.
As part of the: the telescope is in his elevation angle - and thus limited in his mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is, after all, despite relatively small mirror diameter - in the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) the for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can help every computer owner by computing power.
Look at the Observatory of European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name.
With its four mirrors the telescope can also be the medium-sized infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its main mirror is a whopping 42 metres - and nearly 1000 mirror elements.
But can be expected until 2018.
2007 the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea was seen as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the summit of Mauna Kea Observatory, which is next to them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF into the sky.
Also on the summit of Mauna Kea is intended to create a new giant telescope with a mirror average of thirty meters.
It is an illustration.
The main impressions from space, However, the Hubble space telescope.
Since the April 24, 1990, it provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, was by the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture are the final launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be at least until at least 2018 on board a.
The primary mirror of The Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that at the South Pole ice.
However, there are no reliable data, the Messenger far closer to the North Pole revolves around the planet.
Radar measurements for decades, have pointed out that there is on the ice.
The 2004 launched Messenger probe - the first revolves around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
