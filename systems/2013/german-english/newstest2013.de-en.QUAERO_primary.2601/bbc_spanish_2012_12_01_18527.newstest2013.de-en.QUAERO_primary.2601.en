Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapurer lay the blame for the fact that they have no children, the career, the stress and the cost of housing and education.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our civic duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons yet, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore, a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as "," bao "(loaf) in the oven to start worrying about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company, which shot the video, preserves the hope that the advert funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their "national duty."
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it is an issue we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of speed Dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, to compose a rap?
1.2 children
If you do not take this lightly, is the government of Singapore.
Each year, they are US dollars for political action to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government grants for married couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, in southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of the national population authority, says that this was a "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has enabled people to marry and to form a family more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she says.
These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the higher number of people living alone, and delaying marriage and births, the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that led to a drastic increase in the to counter the reduction of the population, resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely masked xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for the low wages and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is seen as one of the reasons for the fact that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the impact on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the cost of health care and immigration policy, the example shows Singapore unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are to be built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and cannot be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the people living alone, and that they discourage construction companies to build large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company El Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" to sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, is the discussions with the Singapurern working in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, so it is by many," says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
"It is important for me, to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons for the fact that they have no children.
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to children, because the government can do so much.
