In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court, which in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few chunk of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia -, each with a penalty of US $100 - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But it is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends less on hundreds of minor drug on the law, on the site.
Hundreds of, which revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures have already dropped.
The police authorities are adults over 21 years longer for possession of small. This is allowed by law, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts Colorados have announced to follow existing marijuana offenses, and people are still in court.
At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains on new, to prevent a state licensed marijuana shops in the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, which is located east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington, scratch on the.
They are waiting for a guide to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that in any case, most states of Colorado, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. There was only legalized the drug for medical purposes and then for private consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Orientation of the state is," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and the end of a grey area in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but it is legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practice questions need to be addressed at this time - for example, as the government of a "reasonable access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities to be agreed.
"Nowhere is it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group.
On 21 November sent Chief Oates an email to his employees in Aurora, in which he said that the prosecutor would not pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years longer, and that the police "" will not for these offences.
The police Chief Oates added that will continue to enforce the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and urban targets would continue to pursue drug traffickers.
In Weld County In northern Colorado represents County prosecutor Ken Buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, even though many have been charged for other offenses.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations, in which it to the point of the offence," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, shows adults for the possession of small amounts of not longer.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but not all outstanding possession proceedings.
"I do not think that I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound dilemma among local officials, the big green experiment.
In a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, the defendants standing trial for marijuana crimes, and as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for it, that they can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an age of legal, they are also nervous wait on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice.

Several cities in Colorado, not just wait for the fact that the federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although this could open in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this legislation.
We have done this for the community, not, for what the state decided.
There are still many questions unanswered.
