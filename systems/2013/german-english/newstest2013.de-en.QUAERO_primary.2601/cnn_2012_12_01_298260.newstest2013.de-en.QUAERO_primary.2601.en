My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Due to the lack of opportunities, Many people are forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times in the memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control as disturbing to me.
Signs pointed to two queues, one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("aliens").
I stood there for a few seconds long, uncertain, which I should go.
I grew up in central California and has been all my life, "Mexicans."
An ethnic symbol - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."
Later, I opted for "Mexican". "
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to talk in this language on both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not go well.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues that, if the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans remain today, with a high probability in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc after the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even though he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single idea that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun forced to leave them more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans, who in centuries, not in minutes, are not the memories of this event.
, as soon as a U.S. government official only mildest criticism in Mexico - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans, the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of on the war path.
And yet the biggest challenge in Mexico is in fact, in the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for whom it does not do this.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - no chance in Mexico, and in the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may have to live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred, perhaps, but when it comes to our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is certainly in the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never strong enough.
They say that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If not our families in Mexico have failed, they would not have gone.
And then we would not be caught behind the silk curtain now - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally as a child in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them.
While it is a US citizen, sees herself as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, who I know, on the not on the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in any one of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education and to to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unequal income distribution, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid you alone, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they must also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members were not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.
