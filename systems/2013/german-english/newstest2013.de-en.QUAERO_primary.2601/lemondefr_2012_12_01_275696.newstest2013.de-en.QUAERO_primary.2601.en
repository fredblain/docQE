With Bitcoin payments and selling without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, from bank, leads to financial crises.
In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as convertible, a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network has already been about 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or payment.
After the price of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to 2 dollars, before he recovered to about ten dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the global trade of real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "," which are used to make progress in a video game by winning games or buy (and sometimes).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and managed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin are all at the same time, money network nodes repositories of the accounting book, auditors, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the accounting book in the entire network of public accounts are available.
The crucial step is to sign this new deal in this book.
This is a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add This additional line.
It is a carving up the file, i.e., the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer, "" the new transaction and add a number of before the whole thing "."
The goal is to find the that number, which is a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without a link, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer, which has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but up to one hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre....
In addition, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The weakness is not the," Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering by means of this anonymous service.
But also cash these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blog platform WordPress, they will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins in circulation.
In November, a "" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coin Abul, Bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner managed its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with them, and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs.
They simply need to an address, photographed and identified by a telephone "can be," Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in the hierarchical systems for in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time to Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, by the way today as a highly regarded risks in the event of a success of this currency.
