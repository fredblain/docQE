My own taste of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt, the project "Petersburg avant-garde," which is dedicated to city dwellers, who are the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the list already landed high-ranking representatives of the art scene, whose successes beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without having to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, dressed in red at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden,, or at openings.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are always issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg philosophical artist, the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the streets and a smile to the faces of his fellow citizens with them for a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg barrel organ player, as it is for this difficult role in terms of its, its philosophy and its image finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and turquoise or yellow, for example, in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In the society of, which differs from the norm, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want my provocations with the people.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know that you have to become a painter?
- In an exhibition in the Palace of Culture, in my work.
I realised that I have to go down this path.
Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter at the time, and new and free painters as I was incomprehensible.
I am with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was a "Pushkinskaya 10," and then once was.
It takes me to the theatre, fashion, music, to everything, except the literature.
- And all the united in your kind clinic... - it was important to me to be at the heart of the culture, where the best creative artists should meet.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovation a club for the Boheme, the house of the.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember how cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and was one of the composer Igor Wdowin today.
When the group began to play live, was from the "Leningrad".
Mountain moderated many programs before the era of "Halli Galli."
We gave them, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics.
Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the hospital.
Our employees and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there was a survey in the press, "people of our city."
"I won in the category of" artist of the year, and so I had arrived at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times, according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
- Your work has a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and make clear the timeliness and sharpness of thought.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as a clown."
Clowns are timeless.
I was socially, but now it hurts and is to be so.
In a clown obliterated everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
For example, we save the world by stipulating that everyone has to dress up.
Now everyone is the clothes and is based on the outside and not on the inside of the people.
But perhaps we should not be a human hand, but he should spit in the face.
The deception disappears through The.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A cultural city should have a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Commercial art can be beautiful?
- Commercial art must be careful, thoughtful and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Large groups of people In the past: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a one-hundred-dollar note each.
Now you have to think about whom you will like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- Come to the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand!
- Women abandoned him, the social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I have painted these pictures, which hung with a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- What is missing Kirill Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real tsars, it was different, because the tsars did not a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what might be the experts, but they will be the way, as it requires hochrangigerer experts is that the former correctly assess and pave the way for them.
Now, only their own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must find other museums.
- What is for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural Capital in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones art is difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
