The word of human rights "is missing in the Constitution."
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future Constitution with Sharia law as The basis is controversial.
The Egyptian president not sparing with pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all, the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because all of them, so far, hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He has said almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the powers of the constitutional court temporarily and its competences, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
In fact, the 234 articles of the constituent assembly in a, were pushed through, in part, worrying.
As in previous constitutions, in the draft, the case law based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
That was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least a new article: in all matters concerning the Sharia law must be given to the Al-Azhar university, the country's main Islamic institution with great clout in the of the entire Sunni Islam.
This is not, but it may mean that the the legislation, which would be the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
In the Verfassunsgsentwurf is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military justice is to be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule for the repression of.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The state should also, as stated in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" to protect "and promote its morals and values."
This is legally so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even could control the content of film, art and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
In fact, no article expressly stipulates equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to or slander.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
As is the wording of the "insulting people" should be banned.
There is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a Leader?
Interpretation, like so much in the draft, which is to be Morsi, and in his to, "very soon" for the referendum will be presented to the Egyptians.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter, before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter MB) of The presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said, belong to the draft constitution "on the scrapheap of history."
Via text messaging service Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters, "a" coup against democracy.
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and him," said the opposition persuade Yasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not to supervise the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, to, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Apollonopolis before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the took part, "the people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "Säubere the country!" And protested: "the Koran is our constitution."
A battle for control of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably have created civil affairs.
Did not want to risk of Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood, both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights, is not even"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would have until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because of the human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now is not the word of human rights in the new constitution," he complained in the interview with the Welt am Sonntag ".
Morsi power extension to all three branches in the state of the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game, and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of civil society, the president de facto," complained Saeda.
But without civil society organisations could not work a democracy.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which considers the ideological struggle on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
A protester in Tahrir warns: "you gebährt a monster, you can no longer control."
