Šimon Ornest: on our concerts, we want to collect positive energy gain
What do you think about it, that is to take place in less than a month of the world?
This is one of those, which we humans are so keen to start.
With our band the Tap Tap we are more fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which can collect enough positive energy in order to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you also have a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine the project to our readers?
It is a national fundraising event, which we have been planning two years ago.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is projected for 21 December at 11: 10 am in the end of the.
The day before, that is, on 20 December, from 21: 00 at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends.
Who is from this idea?
Originally from me, then we have developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we would not only to collect enough positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to consider, together with the public about the state of the world to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters of the world, with its purchase of can also support the people.
The band the Tap Tap has, together with other performers, the so-called anthem against the world, with the title "of the world."
The anthem is very popular on YouTube. It will resound to the charity concerts?
Of course, in the end, provided that everything works and the end Of the world does not take place.
The anthem should be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems are in a direct circuit broadcast live by Czech television.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, which is to the fact that We realize many charity events and concerts.
We are trying to integrate these people in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in cooperating with us, and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts at the end of the world?
For the establishment of the education center Studeo, in which we are already six years with the club in the Jedlička Institute.
The students of The Jedlička Institute are cared for by editors who help them with different leisure activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to go to the editors, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is intended to create a separate building in which we with this project.
At every concert, several groups and performers.
What criteria do you have chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "big events" are planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
We also want to be like Next year in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their overseas plans are not small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. We must also, of course, many instruments suitcase and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems, SA and British Airways were always been very well prepared for us, that I have been surprised sometimes.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By your foreign travel you have a settlement in the various countries with accessibility, as there are people with disabilities, etc.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were in Russia, that is still in its early days in the East.
In Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, it is still unusual, if someone is in a wheelchair in the city centre.
It is not obvious that It is in a wheelchair user, for example, of course, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are clubs try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things on which we are...
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities independently in the public space, go to the museum, you can use toilets etc.
But it is not usual for a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social activities, we are with the band the Tap Tap the West a little ahead.
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but it is only one of our ranks meaning athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really begin to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly determined personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: what motivated in 1998 to create a band?
I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people, who were interested in dealing with.
And since I am a musician And saxophone playing, among other things, along with a colleague, I have a music AG.
Oh, and at the time, as our, Láa Angelovi, likes to say, a little out of control (laughs).
The band became known, but only in the last few years, I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us, and we have also started to advertise for us.
We are aware that if you are and that it is not to the outside world, its own performance in a certain sense, does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also be good editors, and quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to get there with The Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning I felt the potential that we can do things differently.
In the show business often copied to the other.
This is logical in its own way, as new with caution and will be accepted only after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap.
The first impression that The audience is, of course, it is only natural.
But this compassion is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature, we would have to regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities can do something, not just for them, it is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a tough boss, as we hear from many people?
If you want to make something good, there is no compromises on many things, and also need to a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they that they have twice a week, prepared phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the enthusiasm quickly extinguished.
How it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap twenty members.
How many of them were from the outset, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go, That you can prevent.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.
