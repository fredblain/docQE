A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily divided the unlimited power of more than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket.
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly on its final version, the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work to the House.
Egypt is based now for almost two years on a temporary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has a for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president in his "autocratic delirium" is "by breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the side of his supporters are assured that it is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which is forcing the brothers to give up their project, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest raging across the country.
In an interview with the American Wochenschau Time seems to have to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution is supposed to end.
85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent assembly approved the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the has not complied with the request.
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have, because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views.
Representatives from human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
To achieve the quorum yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members added.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... the time has come for the prayer, because some members of the panel were of the opinion that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not.
The text, which was last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all the attention, after all, identical to that of the 1971 constitution states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped, "the principles" by "the rules," which would have made a stricter application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed, a proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" of the liberals, who see it as propaganda.
According to the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items.
They are particularly Article 220 in the eye of the Al-Azhar University, which awards an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people who are being asked to, have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals also fed by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no Ulema, but academics, who have been trained in the French system, "appeased Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity may be, because the terms of the religious vocabulary.
It is in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of civilian judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday sharply because of the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that these are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will be submitted to Parliament, but a national defence council.
There will be no ban on civil trial in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their concerns with regard to the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, underscores Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
They say that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president last night had to say on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march Saturday.
