Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not?
The test, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to a greater reluctance of men already undecided for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret the data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher if no screening was carried out.
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk For men African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer was identified.
There are cancers that, the aggressive and others, they are indolent.
The patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer by pointed out the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate cancer, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and will be in this case for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, in which the cancer detected no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
It is an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and those who do not.
I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests.
The most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be done or not.
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

To prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eating well and would move enough.
"If there is no more smoking, this would rise at least to 50%," says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It greatly damages the health of the people.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to have the risk of breast, colon, rectal,,, and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer during the entire life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In, it increases the risk of a Grimm or rectal cancer.
Sausages should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
At present, but Their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
While a study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also has not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu, how important it is to talk with his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
