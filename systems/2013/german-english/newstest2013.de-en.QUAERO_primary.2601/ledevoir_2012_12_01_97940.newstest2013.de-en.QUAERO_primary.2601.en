Palliative care - the best way to die.
With its Committee on "death With dignity," Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of the end of life.
The debate has to be in The near future, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this.
A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which it aufzehrte, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, it is not can be prepared," he says.
The disease makes his work: a huge weakness prevents him from going to the toilet and even to eat.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned, agrees with the help.
He even manages to smile and speak with strangers who are around him, give him his medication, and a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that My diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this.
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of.
In return, the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept a retrograde step, he says.
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, big events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are by the doctors and nurses who care for them, with a so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89, is the worst fear, to die, "and by suffocation."
But by the disease, I have my children really.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no longer in life," she says, before she accepts that she wears a mask that helps her breathe.
It expects in the next few days, despite a recent visit to her son, who is from Italy.
In the home Victor Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance In food intake.
The palliative care is used if there are no other options.
In order to make the deaths.
In Quebec, a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little, given that we will all die one day.
The life in the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying wishes, according to an oral care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics to control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Last night Mr X, we have a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son will drink beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike," says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor Gadbois is different every day.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, the last family gathering in the courtyard and is supported by his pillow, while his honor, a young man of 36 years, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive.
"For six months are three to five beds with cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel worries.
53% of patients admitted to the home Victor Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, to a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of and the society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is this major shortcomings in the care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which has been signed by prominent figures of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec the health system is not enough to ensure that all of the right to have a high-quality palliative care before accepting move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, with its has taken measures to alleviate.
I am afraid that the patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions hard until the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has broken off a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I will break the treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told them.
However, she had told me that I was at the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff, that it is not granted this wish, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that the palliative care in pain treatment is not.
After Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care of the society of domestic palliative care of Montreal 8% of patients do not speak to a pain treatment.
At the very end the life of the doctors rely so often terminal sedation, which the patients either sporadically or permanently to the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if We do not perceive this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will have the opportunity to the terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want to put me," but "I want to see my pain."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian health research Institute.
