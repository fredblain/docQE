<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to counter the Obama re-election</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policy with the need to combat election fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Brennan center the latter as a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States as the number of people killed by lightning strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is for sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike Canada, the United States responsible for the conduct of the elections in the various member states.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this sense, the majority of American governments announced new laws since 2009, the procedures for the registration or ballot.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 seen new Republican representatives in 26 states.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, 180 Bills introduced in 2011 alone, which limit the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require that voters present a photograph ID and proof of US citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, these laws also shortened the time frames for the early vote, declared the right to register as voters on election day, and citizens are denied the right to vote, for which a court acts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">before the 2006 elections has no US-state of the electorate, a photograph card show.</seg>
<seg id="14">INDIANA was the first federal state, has made such a request.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law in Indiana in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities rushed this practice extended to other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the last two years, they promoted bills in 34 states, where voters are forced into a photograph card show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of the citizens of the United States, say that 21 million voters who do not photograph card issued by a government authority of their state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, are often more than a hundred dollars to obtain the necessary card to pay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions are disproportionately affects young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary light picture card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This goes further.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, are seen as voters, their vote more for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photograph card issued by its establishment.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, allow the same States members of Angel- or hunting clubs, choose the more on the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2004, a federal state in which to choose a proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state to make such a request.</seg>
<seg id="29">since 2011, a dozen states have laws adopted by the voters demand that they prove their US citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly aimed to limit the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters to the Democratic Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, Republican legislators in eight states laws in 2011, which was abolished the registration of voters on election day.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups, to help those voters who want to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, the campaigns have contributed to voter registration for the general elections in 2004, approximately 10 million citizens to register.</seg>
<seg id="36">The measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, in the general elections in 2008 were 33% of the electorate in Florida, have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they account for only 13% of the voters of the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same applies to the Hispanic population.</seg>
<seg id="40">The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens have chosen in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast, the white, 76% of the voters, only 46% of the electorate, in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws, which restrict the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several Bills have been blocked by the veto, the democratic governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The advocate-General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">They were able to limit some of the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the displayed a photograph card.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The Democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the outcome in key states for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Brennan centre of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, 171 men represent the 270 votes in the electoral body are needed in order to win the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">This leads to more hesitation is already helping men for the implementation of screening tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">The test should be made or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have sought the opinion of two doctors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The studies conducted in the United States, many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study has also shown that the likelihood of education in an observation after 12 years of metastases is between 30% and 40% higher if no screening was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="9">I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years if a direct relatives, was already ill with prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is also a higher risk in men Afro-American origin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are cancers that are aggressive and indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer, the possible options which prostate crabs can remain untouched if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases tend to opt for an active monitoring of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, many of the men, where cancer has seen no treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">It proposes you a active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">With increasing accuracy determines the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, I therefore recommend the implementation of the tests.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not it should be carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In cooperation with the international society for Urologie, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA tests.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21">prevention of the disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy way of life is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian cancer society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is expected that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several remain unresolved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">for the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It damages the health of the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">encouraging data: Ten years after the elimination of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also the outbreak of disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">It seems the risk for breast cancer, Grimmdarm- Mastdarm- to increase SpeiseröHren- BauchspeicheldrüSen- and cervical cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colorectal cancer, fairy tale" throughout the lives, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The food</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">in large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm- or rectum.</seg>
<seg id="41">sausages should also be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between cancer and vitamin supplements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">its investigations but are not conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Canadian cancer society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While the study found by the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, showed another rather an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D to cancer was not yet clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu, stresses how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family to speak to burden.</seg>
<seg id="51">"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs-Boson analysed</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Bosons has a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">In fact, we believe that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">and it is the last particle whose existence of the standard model, our best or 'least wrong' explanation of nature and behaviour of the matter, predicted, but has not yet been observed empirically.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">for physicists, however, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the standard model Higgs-Boson much resembles.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data this week have been presented at a major physics Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data in order to be completely safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">But we assume that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently there is only a low risk to deceive, and we look at what it is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this world, there is a crucial law, which means that two objects cannot be at the same place at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not possible to violate this rule-and try not to, because they will hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for such a law, they also applies: the Pauli exclusion principle established, the states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" and the "State" by and large, consists of some of its properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">On this basis, the physicists share the particles in two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In one corner are good citizens, are referred to as the Fermi one and just obey the principle of Pauli.</seg>
<seg id="14">and in the other the Bosonen, a nasty bunch of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, in any case, not this principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same place at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These Bosonen links, according to the website the particle adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen, we will not deal with, and "force particles", by which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson somehow would be used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Here, it must be emphasised, however, that not all these Bosonen exotic creatures, such as one might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you are able to read this story, then it is only thanks to a Bosons by exceptional banality: the Photon, or "light particles, the" messenger "of the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">If a particle with an electrical load will be speeded up or change the direction, "disrupted" the electromagnetic field in this place, as a pebble in a pond was thrown out.</seg>
<seg id="19">This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the Bosonen "sources of power."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">more stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that a different field, "disrupted" the Higgs field, must be, so that this Boson.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus needs to achieve a very high energies, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rock Zerfurcht.</seg>
<seg id="23">A huge particle accelerator as CERN is therefore needed-the large hadron collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km, in order to achieve such energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Once again, the analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, a piece of paper would never think of themselves on the fridge.</seg>
<seg id="27">and equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the other (as is the photon) do not have mass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">for what all this research can now "be good," Mrs Plamondon asks?</seg>
<seg id="29">for the Science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists all deviations between the observations and to look closely at the predictions of the SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are, in fact, many physicists eagerly hope that such derogations to be found, as the slightest difference open a door to a "new physics" and could fill some of the holes in the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must say that the latter is still major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (UPS) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">However, the CERN such derogations which, until now, has not been found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.</seg>
<seg id="35">In fact, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first permanent line were the first laser (Gepulst)-said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a "gimmick" laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="38">imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition, applications can also surrounded from all the instruments, the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">Willard Boyle again during his work in the optics in 1969, for example, has developed a small light sensor.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras in the world today serves as "an eye and has brought him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the Lhc will change our lives, but it means that you really never know...</seg>

<p>

<seg id="3">The debate needs to be resumed in the near future, although a Bill is being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, in this important area, much remains to be done.</seg>
<seg id="5">le devoir has tried to look into this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago, Mr l. still lived alone in his apartment in the MontéRéGie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate cancer, Aufzehrte, had left him a period of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years," he said half-hearted in his bed in the home for palliative care, Victor-Gadbois in beloeil, in which he reached the previous day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"However, it is always a shock to one cannot be prepared," he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from, only to go to the toilet and even to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">table a delicious lunch, do help he resigned, to eat.</seg>
<seg id="12">He even manages to smile bravely and to speak with strangers, which employs around him, his medicines, and offer him a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">the courage of ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea heals, since this is humiliating," he shares.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man in Pinkelt ', told Pierre Victor-Gadbois Brodeur, a psychologist in homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">In return the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"It depends on the person's ability" to take a step backwards, he notes.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to several people who work in the palliative care, big events in the midst of this backward steps take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-trained Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">At this stage, the doctors and nurses to look after them, no longer with so-called "curative care."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For example, 89 years, the worst fear, "aware and dying of suffocation".</seg>
<seg id="24">But I really got to know my children from the disease.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children," she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have no more hope in life," she says, before they accepted that a mask on, helps her breathe.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are expected in the next few days still a last visit their son, comes from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">homes Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of voluntary body care and assistance in the food.</seg>
<seg id="29">The palliative care will be used if there are no other options.</seg>
<seg id="30">to make the die comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec, a bed on state residents for palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is very little, if one takes into account that one day we will all die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">continued here will live under the best possible conditions, said Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the homes.</seg>
<seg id="34">both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="35">it granted the dying wish of a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi.</seg>
<seg id="36">the diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.</seg>
<seg id="37">and death is part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening, we have X a beer is served, who died in the course of the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">This morning, his son from drinking the beer at the feet of the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help families and patients alike," reported care Director Nathalie Savard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">homes Victor Gadbois is no day-as the other.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition to an old man of 93 years, the last family meeting in court and well supported by his pillow, while its official opening, a young man dies of his parents, his wife of 36 years, which is surrounded and his two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"for six months, three to five beds are always subject to cancer patients in less than 45 years of age", Dr Christiane shares Martel worries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the home Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their residential site, 47% come from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, in other words a care to alleviate the suffering of patients if they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">and several organisations, such as the victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">This is the great flaw in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors rule for the adoption of a law on euthanasia and Assistiertem suicide with concerns.</seg>
<seg id="49">For the month of October is a manifesto in the circulation of prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe signed in order to express their opposition to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">Dr Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not strong enough to ensure that all have the right to a high-quality palliative care before it is accepted, move on to euthanasia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room without that it has taken measures to alleviate.</seg>
<seg id="52">I am afraid that the only reason why the patients want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.</seg>
<seg id="53">At the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions stubbornly until the last day.</seg>
<seg id="54">The chances of survival of HéLèNe Richard were already minimal when it broke off a difficult chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I Onko login has been told that I will stop the treatment, they replied that they regret that I told the fight, please.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, she had told me that I was in the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No Omni strong care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients, who have asked to die, to thank the staff, that it has not granted this wish, after their pain was eased by a team of palliative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">But it must be made clear that the palliative care of the pain treatment is not omnipotent.</seg>
<seg id="60">Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care society the domestic palliative care to the greater MONTREAL 8% of patients not on the treatment of pain.</seg>
<seg id="61">at the very end of life so the doctors often resort to the Terminale Sedierung, which amounts to the patients either sporadic or permanently by the time of his death EinzuschläFern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity on this Terminale Sedierung.</seg>
<seg id="64">patients whose pain is not be relieved, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season, with PSG, you have taken on a new dimension.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">it from a personal point of view, but also can be explained by the new dimension of the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">great players arrived.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day I am on your side.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff has given me too much.</seg>
<seg id="8">These elements spur me to improve my play every day.</seg>
<seg id="9">and in a game, this is easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football everything very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I must stop not enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Claire Fontaine to my game time in Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">They are thus the competition advantage introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">The newcomers are accustomed to this summer's Games very high levels.</seg>
<seg id="15">They also know that any training unit is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">This means that a player as I stand up to, and wants to give his best.</seg>
<seg id="17">It gives me Carlo Ancelotti position much in terms of my game.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Ancelotti is the right person for the job?</seg>
<seg id="20">of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti instills all technicians respect.</seg>
<seg id="22">At present, there is no comparable in the Ligue 1 person and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He had contact with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that he will win another title in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">I had just recovered from an injury series.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of Spitzenreiters.</seg>
<seg id="31">But we lurk in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: We have qualified for the eighth final in this way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the objective of the Association in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to get as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, we have very good European teams say.</seg>
<seg id="37">First of all, we want the first of our group Porto, so that we can fight the return leg of the eighth finales than home game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can the PSG in the short term, a major European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">He has said the budget...</seg>
<seg id="40">In order to be a great European club must win Paris title and make a name in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is not the case today.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially, the PSG the resources so that the project taking shape.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">It would be a great failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">of course, this would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year, it is really close to my heart, this title cream off.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season we were close.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough for the victory.</seg>
<seg id="48">We have finished the season with a very strong performance.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have concluded with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">should normally be master with 79 points...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">I believe that this year is the right thing to do.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux in title fight, I believe that we have the stuff to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">In the light of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">We fully accept that.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, if we win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you can still find something, what you accuse us, something is certainly frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what people expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We could never win every weekend with 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not of the FC Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="61">We are trying to set up a game concept.</seg>
<seg id="62">Building a team with the time.</seg>
<seg id="63">in the Champions League we have shown strength.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons fails to qualify for the eighth final, and also has a huge expenditure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In terms of the sums invested believed one lead you to time out with 15 points.</seg>
<seg id="66">This would mean that our opponents and ignored the French Cup.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new PSG "Geboostet."</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems completely have to be dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</seg>
<seg id="71">so much the better, that speaks of a "Zlatan Ibrahimovic dependence".</seg>
<seg id="72">In other words, that have strong and firing many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">that is why he came, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">wherever he has played, he has eyes that he is a great player and a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">within the team, we respect both the player and the person.</seg>
<seg id="76">it also respects the people who surrounded him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is really extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="78">This encourages others to improve their play.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, allows all other also to make progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How have you seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">It was very important to me to participate in this championships.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately, my injury has prevented from having some game time.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw things there, from which I am stronger.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, I am unable to achieve good games in the national team.</seg>
<seg id="86">This was the "Bleus" my hope for my baptism.</seg>
<seg id="87">What has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">what you think of the first few months of Didier Deschamps, head of the "Bleus"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He has achieved promising results.</seg>
<seg id="90">We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">The national coach is strict, is close to the players and to the victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">As Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I have no comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had achieved its aim, had qualified for the European Championships.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" after Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">On 16 October in Spain is forced undecided (1: 1) a start game?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game has given us confidence.</seg>

<seg id="4">In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented a virtual currency Bitcoin both (convertible into dollars, euros, etc) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange of such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With 15,000 computers in the network have been around 200,000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin as donation or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">In June 2011, after the course of Bitcoin had reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) to $2, he fell five months later today, before it recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website Bitcoincharts.Com).</seg>
<seg id="8">nothing particularly impressive in comparison with the real world trade currencies or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown.</seg>
<seg id="10">It describes Bitcoin virtual currency as "the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro," and "similar to the traditional currencies."</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to make progress in a video game, you play by winning or buy (and sometimes can also exchange).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, trade is controlled by a Central Authority each time and processed.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, with Bitcoin all network nodes, auditors, trustee of the paper money-issuers and buyers and sellers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">In reality, any transaction between two users will take place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">with the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A series of associated with this transaction data electronically through a double encryption system will be signed.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins account book in the whole network of public accounts are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The crucial step is to register this new transaction in the book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is done through a mathematical task on the computers will be launched, with the winners of a kind of preliminary central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a fragment of the file, the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The aim is to find that number, a special fingerprint (many Noughts at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">If this figure has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is permanently linked with the chain of all other transactions and any modification would change the fingerprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user to cheat two time very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money would want to pay, only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains, without a link, because both have different fingerprints.</seg>

<seg id="35">"The weakness is not the actual minutes used", Pierre Noizat, has just introduced Paymium assures us that a company is to pay with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, cash also contains these shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="38">major players, such as Wikipedia refuse donations.</seg>
<seg id="39">others such as the blog platform Wordpress will accept them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analysed by the Weizmann Institute in Israel the account book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins in circulation.</seg>

<seg id="1">A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a new game of poker from President Mohammed Mursi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt in terms of the constitutional declaration, it temporarily, more divided than ever, given the unlimited power he has decided to put everything on a card.</seg>
<seg id="4">To the surprise of all, the next day he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will adopt its final version.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week ago, the head of this house an additional two months to complete its work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Egypt now for almost two years, is based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative has only provided for a further division of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">for his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium", he continues, "breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the part of his supporters can rest assured that there is a way to bring an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, and to speed up the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">A referendum should be held within 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="11">a very short period, forcing the brothers on their projects, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.</seg>
<seg id="12">for the president, it is also a way to rediscover his public and democratic legitimacy, during the protest in the raging throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">In an interview with the American week after contrary perspective time Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Given that the Egyptian people with this resort on a hasty vote an ultimatum: 'Is it for my draft or I will reserve the unlimited power ", the latter should be an end to the alleged after the adoption of the constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">85 largely Islamist members of the constituent assembly have adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the liberals is not complied with the request.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the eve of the constitutional declaration they have averted in mid-November, because they believe that they are not in the situation, to assert their views.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities and civil society have acted similarly.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to achieve the quorum yesterday morning were members of 11 people in a rush, deputy added.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Generally, it is not surprising that the article were adopted unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, the commentators found it amusing that the only disagreement was expressed for the prayer of the day... in the time is, as some Members of the Board were of the opinion that the shuttle at the constituent assembly was not exactly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2, all the attention has, finally, identical with that of the constitution of 1971, and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi Islamic parties for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, the hope, "to replace the principles" by "the rules", which would have made it possible to have a stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">for the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of its good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"hypocrisy," say the Liberals, who see this only as a propaganda blow.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to them, the Islamisation of the constitution on other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">They have, in particular, Article 220, the Al-Azhar University placed a consultative role, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people who are called upon to give an opinion, not elected and any democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">you can see the first signs of a theocracy. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the Liberals will also be fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university will be far less moderate than the present.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At present, no specific religious commitment.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.</seg>
<seg id="35">most of the lawyers, who have worked on this text, are not Ulema, but academics, was trained in the French system, "soothed Alexis Blouet, writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitution transition.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, he acknowledges that "there may be some ambiguity in relation to Article 220, because terms borrowed from the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">It relates in particular to the "Fiqh '[Islamic law], Anm. that red.</seg>
<seg id="38">and in the future could be raised the question of whether civil judges are competent to decide. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">in addition to its religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday strongly criticised because of the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another point of contention: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">in accordance with the wishes of the military review of the defence budget will not be presented to the parliament, but a National Defence Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">There will also be a ban on civil procedure in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text with the tradesmen, as freedom.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, no longer article refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">your opinion is the only positive point of the ban on torture by Article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not included in the previous constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president had to comment on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="50">The supporters of the head of state will be Saturday on marching.</seg>

<seg id="2">While members and human rights activists to discuss the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminal act already with counterfeit certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Every year 13 million guest workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">their only aim is to remaining families to earn money for the maintenance of the home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A law came into force on 1 December, according to which any working immigrant must take a test, the knowledge of the Russian language,.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this Regulation applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, the local housing and retail.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, should the tests with the time, according to the Federal Migration authority for all migrant workers on duty in the future.</seg>
<seg id="9">We must not only in Russian history and language tests, but also tests the foundations of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">language, both for the preservation, as well as the extension of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">The only exceptions apply to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">People are also excluded from the scope of this law, the training certificates and diplomas received before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The point, the problem and the protection of rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The examination will be under the aegis of the Pushkin-Institute for the Russian language, the Russian People's Friendship University, Moscow State University, of the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian high schools.</seg>
<seg id="15">The migrants can take the tests in all cities; similar centres in Russia more than 160 have already been opened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, human rights activists said several times before the entry into force of the law in the press the following question: What does the whole?</seg>
<seg id="18">The legislation, to produce what changes, both for the Russians and for guest workers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular, say the migration authority spokesman, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.</seg>
<seg id="21">their rights must be protected but before their departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only an organised recruitment will be 90% foreign workers to solve the problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">encounter problems immigrants without work, education, language skills and medical observation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably meet people with evil intentions, which, under the pretext of aid it in a dark, close cabin, where he stay with dozens of his same months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day toil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">We get many complaints from our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In the home will have a promised and, upon arrival, they cheated, confiscated their passports and do not receive the promised pay ', the head of the main administration for migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">not shout, boss!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia not only want their money, that they do not speak the language of the country of destination, but also can hardly express in writing in their own language.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is your fault, not so much as the evil: only a few of the Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only a sound basic education.</seg>
<seg id="30">because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them a decent clothing, shoes and school matters.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a teenager, these children will be the first opportunity to earn money immediately.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It is difficult without language," they give.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You FüHlst humiliated and degraded."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Human rights activists say the law following important aspect.</seg>
<seg id="35">The test must only migrants with legal status.</seg>
<seg id="36">They do not have this status, so there is no test and therefore no official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">'warm welcome' or 'entry prohibited for unauthorised'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">many migrants to confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason, of course, bureaucratic hurdles and the linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">it also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Most of the staff of the Russian police know that our documents forged and we are not registered, and it then cases of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="44">"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"just to spare no expense for false papers'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants may be falsified.</seg>
<seg id="47">some counterfeit certificates, the completion of the language tests certify by staff of the Federal Migration Service have been hijacked.</seg>
<seg id="48">The fraudulent documents were printed with a normal color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">of course, the new owners have received this not for nothing: every migrant, hoped to spare as the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is more than twice as much as the cost for the official test: This costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, it cannot simply be bought the certificates, both officials and human rights activists agree.</seg>
<seg id="52">For the moment, the public authorities can guest workers who fall through the test for the first time, that it is time for a language course.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition, the new arrivals will be offered without knowledge in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every fourth American young people sitting behind the pay of Mc Donald 's</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the last few days there was everywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Wal Mart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell and Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Still, no one can predict whether the protests will further increase or the air soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit-making organisations.</seg>
<seg id="6">in addition to the increase of modest salaries of simple Walmart- and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents in a year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called black Friday, the sales in the United States, the millions of customers Anlockten, which sometimes led to Handgemengen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To this day, some Wal-Mart, with workers, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and Bestreikten branches of the chain, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, whose target people of low and middle-income.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Wal Mart, ranging from nappies on hunting guns and car batteries, all products sold to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The goods in the Wal Mart branches is between 8% and 27% more on average than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Why buy many of the low-paid Wal Mart employees only on their own work.</seg>
<seg id="14">the prices and the variety made Wal Mart to one of the largest companies in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics, Wal Mart can sell the goods are often so favourable, because the workers are poorly paid.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter complaints about hard work conditions, for example the lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the operation of their own health insurance has risen from $30 to $100 a month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Wal-Mart, with workers, $9.5 deserves the time, could not afford the increase, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley, show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Wal Mart 3.2 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="20">The approximately 1.1% more than they now pay donations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Wal Mart would pass the increases on customers, every purchase you only 46 cents more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">per year would be for you today compared to more spending of only 12,39 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">supporters of Wal Mart note with satisfaction that it only came to protests in nine states and the companies gave no losses.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Black Friday took in his shop Thursday evening from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period Wal Mart sold approximately 5,000 articles per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Overall, Wal Mart-funds on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post, that "less than five" Wal Mart-staff laid down the work and the protest only "another PR Stunt," the trade union, the protests have been organised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free cash!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests this week in New York, where their goal but not Wal Mart branches (which are not wanted in this progressive city and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and others were cheap restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says the company sell billion chickens, and yet you provides no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">New York City Council member Jumaane Williams</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour under federal and New York legislation.</seg>
<seg id="32">in fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage and increased, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8,90 US dollar an hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Nobody in this expensive city less than they deserve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">as it is possible, in New York, with so little money, is beyond me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's was behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">hardly anyone saw is the main source of income or had to stay there longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">now meet me in interviews with staff of McDonald's always people who complain that they do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper, the author points out, it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how to feed them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants in the protests, which at 6.00 a.m. before the McDonald's on Thursday began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanding that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.</seg>
<seg id="40">They called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The US law prohibits it to stand in the way of corporate governance, this objective and trade unionists Abzumahnen or redundant.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the business leaders are not simply.</seg>
<seg id="43">the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is difficult but also for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">The main reason is the high staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">unhappy</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">On this day, vocal protests, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The height of the protests was a house on at the McDonald's in Times Square, with some local Democrats languages, including city council member Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's says it sell billion chickens, and yet you provides no sick days, and will not pay for your honest work."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, said that "we should work together to support the fast-food workers, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, the all New Yorkers deserve."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, of which by far not all in the fast-food industry, working in the tens of thousands in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The brain is so far only moderately on lists'</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">supporters of modern technology purveyors of the recently enlarged reality will usually seen through the lens of a special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">first Google at its annual conference in the summer presented a working model in November was then aware that Microsoft had filed for a patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.</seg>
<seg id="5">It fascinates the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands and to create virtual free land.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- you briefly describe what research group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to expand the borders of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">So far, the largely stuck in the phase in which mankind with Pixeln worked on flat screens, sometimes will also be affected.</seg>
<seg id="9">But we want to look ahead of 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors sold a progress, and these days, no more Xbox Kinect, as all for widespread interest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">what awaits us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although Kinect has brought the interaction on a physical level, plays a great deal still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the spending has not yet decisive.</seg>
<seg id="14">We are trying to change, work on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.</seg>
<seg id="15">We need the computer world in our physical world and make it comprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is, however, essential that not only the users, but also its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="17">then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.</seg>
<seg id="18">First and foremost we should Bescheuerten virtual-reality helmets Los!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- what do you think about management?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is popular, but it is not overvalued?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- it is certainly not the end solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because not all would like to inform others about his actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, every kind of interaction with computers, but each in their specific niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, we were in the field of the management of objects on a project in which we in public places with short and narrow, with Ausladenden gestures-face.</seg>
<seg id="24">The gestures were not the object of a bracelet, which recorded the movements of the camera, but registered bone and muscle.</seg>
<seg id="25">Still, it is relatively large, but could in theory be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But, on the whole, however, the future joint management types, for example Gestik and language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">We would ask me, for example, this Sprudel Tin you rich?</seg>
<seg id="29">They say it and, at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">normally i say it simply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- this means they want the users adapt to the what can make a machine at the time and what is not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the next time, I think that we must be especially to work on the development of new types of sensor, which enable more reactions from people.</seg>
<seg id="35">This can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good break in the deep, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The demands on the basis of their work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">There is a lack of dissolution, deep or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">of course, 8 megapixel with a speed of 1000 FPS is not bad.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the main thing is not the mega pixel itself, but the quality and the depth of the Matrix.</seg>
<seg id="41">All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, as the designer of the algorithms have more work.</seg>
<seg id="42">It must not only along the dissolution of the X-, Y-, but also along the Z-axis will be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="43">The speed and the number of images per second are also important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 FPS, especially for gestures to little.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes contact in our laboratory in Redmond developed a sensor with a Regulierbaren processing delay between 1 to 100 milli-seconds, with today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).</seg>
<seg id="46">not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">I needed for my work as a device, only without contact management and with more images per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- the number of cameras should not be increased?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", with one of them, in fact, an infrared channels and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">and the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-camera.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not intended to calculate the object deep.</seg>
<seg id="52">More cameras may solve the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">or increase the problem, since more calculations would be needed.</seg>
<seg id="54">It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with various camera orientation, to see how the in three-dimensional identifying a position helps us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Microsoft presented-if I remember rightly, in contrast to Google's glasses were not to the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens has the best prospects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- of course it is not pleasant, travelling to keep a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: Tollste variant would be a "rotating" enhanced reality, we have a cloud of the glasses on the smart next May.</seg>
<seg id="58">the lens is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private only you can see), but also its weakness, because a larger reality by means of glasses, that they can work together with other virtual objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of the virtual Hologramme in the air not only Tony stark is accessible from iron, but also human beings.</seg>
<seg id="60">This idea, there is a problem, the critics often say: there is no tangible response.</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands feel nothing at all!</seg>
<seg id="62">What answers to their group at this point?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- in my lectures, I often talk that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I believe the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of Taktilen perception.</seg>
<seg id="65">An interesting method is the use of a second hand rather unusual projection document.</seg>
<seg id="66">It takes pressure very true!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that are really aimed at "images in the air" something concrete, for example, the collision of some targeted ultrasound radiation in a certain point where the finger, but a feeling at the moment is still so fragile, as Pustete somebody on the hand ball.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bands for the Commission on the nerve endings detect in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Have you tried to outsmart the brain?</seg>
<seg id="70">We think that it is, what it should feel if it sees something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- it is a good idea, so we have not tried.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here lies another task, we will still have to fight for a long time, namely a person is physically in a closed space, to believe he was instead in an open, virtually infinite space here; we are working on concepts with course bands (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large bullets.</seg>
<seg id="73">So far, the brain only moderately on lists, and we still have many busy years.</seg>
<seg id="74">that makes the work so attractive for researchers in the field of virtual reality: on many issues, we are only at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="12">I chose the colour red than fashion designer, the deals with the optics and image.</seg>
<seg id="13">in this world is red the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">The society calls for everything from the grey standard, aggression and bad behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do want my provocations come into contact with the people.</seg>
<seg id="16">any of my last provocation was an invitation to talks.</seg>

<seg id="20">Then there was the time the old free, but not officially recognized painter to the end, and new and free painters such as I were incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="21">I so friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was "Pushkin kaja 10" and then was only once.</seg>
<seg id="22">i prefer it to the theatre, to fashion, music, everything except the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">in your way-- and all the United Hospital...-it was important to me, in the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I occupied a space in the Pushkin kaja 10, and there was a musical-artistic Club by the renovation work for the Boheme, the house of Petersburg Boheme.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Nkú Chief: control of the black-system failed due to the fault of the policy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but back in their application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the conversation for AktuáLně.Cz says the Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší Kontrolní úřAd Nkú), Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly-and I think that this is not the case with us," Kala comment on the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A similar result also appears to have a common control by Czech and German examiners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He leads a negative practice example the attitude of Prime Minister Petr NečAs for the so-called "black-system."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS entrepreneurs would not trouble with controls-so the system is now banned or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"A law must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, but is not simply the government chairman, and the control, whose duty is to hamper the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work", Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">They spoke at the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Chamber of Deputies about a joint Czech-German project, under which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.</seg>
<seg id="10">So what was it exactly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">there is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, it is a question that the European legislation, as public contracts to manage and build the national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">all of this, we have compared with each other, and, although the investigation is not finished yet, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, perhaps even "with US laws are strict and perfect ', but the actual application is better in Germany in some of the parameters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This confirms that it is not enough, always new and more precise rules. We must also deal with the actual application of the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How can you help the project? What is for them from this project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">just such a common control could help that we stop constantly perfecting the laws in order to try and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this evidently not particularly positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">efficiency means one thing to a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the lowering of the threshold values for contracts does not guarantee that we are achieving this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps it is that the system in this way only with excessive 'paperwork', and those seeking loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, remained higher than if the threshold values.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">you talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech law.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the system work in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a similar authority as our Nkú, or the system works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As far as the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent to Nkú the federal court that is built, and also has a college that is slightly different in principle both authorities to be formed, but similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The skills are comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, in other words that there is this federal courts in the individual countries, the German system is different from our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Brh can only control federal funds, consistent with our national resources.</seg>
<seg id="26">public funds, which will be managed by the counties and municipalities, under the control of the country's courts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What the German legislation is easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In general I would compare without specific information only reluctantly. Nevertheless, Germany is often described as a model in some ways, but it is certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This is perhaps because the auditors are better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Certainly not, but as I said, such comparisons may I do not particularly like.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, also have problems to contend with.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise you would have nothing of the cooperation with our authority, not true?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What the Czech legislation, which was important for their authority to review the procurement law, feel they have any impact?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In view of the fact that this amendment is, in force for only a short time, it is not in our tests so far.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since our controls take place, we must here with some delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We feel effects have so far been rather controls in the preparatory phase of the future-we have introduced the new instrument of control "identification of risks of waste," and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed-This will effect the changes, of course, since the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified and others</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this adoption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The problem, however, is that the rules can be "strict" and can no longer be met.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the previous rules are a test Unterzogenen persons against the winner (for example, in the event of the operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) accountable, that any failure of the procurement law is tantamount to a breach of discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But it is useful to make the law more stringent?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">I do not think this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those who attack and want to abuse the system, and not penalise those who have committed a mistake, not the actual decision-making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Where is the way out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We say, first of all, what is not successful.</seg>
<seg id="47">The prime minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs would not bother with control of the so-called "black-system '- What exactly does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">The black-system is now banned or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">A Bill must have valid, and if something is banned by law, but it is not just the Government can control, whose duty is the chairman, and the monitoring of compliance with the law, in its activities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He can say: "we need to change the law and allow the cause", but he can'T say that we act as if nothing had happened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions-and this is for the protection of the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">On the other hand, but it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer simply because of procedural irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly-and I think that is what we are lacking.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally from me, then we have the idea together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">We would like not only sufficient positive energy, in order to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to consider, together with the public, the state in which we give our children about this world.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have a unique Kollektion of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters of the developed world, with their purchase on Www.E-Tap.Cz people can also support us.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">of course, and in the end, provided that all the work and the world does not take place...</seg>
<seg id="18">The national anthem should be sung by all actors at all three concerts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the anthems in a direct line from the Czech television broadcast live.</seg>

<seg id="23">We are trying to integrate these people involved in our projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has shown that the most interested in working with us, and have fun.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">for the establishment of a barrier-free education centre Studeo we already six years working together with the club tap JedličKa Institute.</seg>
<seg id="27">the pupils of the JedličKa Institute are regularly cared for by teachers, to help them in various leisure activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">As the pupils themselves do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the framework of the completion of the JedličKa Institute is a separate building in which we then with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Each concert, several groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what criteria they have selected?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We wanted to put together a programme that addresses all the generations including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">For example, China in Prague ski, Support Lesbiens illu stratosphere with Dan BáRta, the tap tap, MariáN Bango and Jiří Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">they know everything further on the website Www.Kpks.Cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">similar "big events" are planned for the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We are for the first time in May at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year, we would also like the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States-then this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">their overseas plans are not just small, yet they are already in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="39">However, the tap tap is composed of a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">as you travel this logistical and organisational?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="42">five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage area. We must also, of course, many instruments towing suitcases and other luggage...</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, čSa and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I sometimes even surprised me.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we were, there were no problems recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Through their travel abroad, they have a comparison, how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how we deal with disabled people, etc.</seg>
<seg id="46">How have you seen these things so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than us, especially in Russia, we witnessed that is still in its infancy in the East.</seg>
<seg id="48">Moscow is absolutely not accessible to Prague. It is still unusual, if someone is travelling alone in a wheelchair in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is not even there, of course, that a wheelchair users, for example, in the lift.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately there clubs, too, trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">and in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many things on which we depend on...</seg>
<seg id="53">note, however, that an improvement in the situation is also always depends on the efforts of the parties concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">in London and Madrid, it is common for people with severe disabilities itself constantly in the public area can move into a museum, toilets etc.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not just that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events with the band the tap tap slightly ahead of the West.</seg>
<seg id="56">public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if significant from our ranks athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers, are things really begin to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far, only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The tap tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years: What has motivated in 1998, to set up a band?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I then began as carers in JedličKa Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in to deal with something hard.</seg>
<seg id="60">Among other things, and because I am a musician and Saxofon Games, along with a colleague, I have established a music company.</seg>
<seg id="61">and with time, as our host, LáďA Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">But the band was known only in the last few years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us; we have also started to promote active for us.</seg>
<seg id="64">we realised that if you are doing something and not to see this outwardly, their own performance, in a sense, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to EU funding, we can also make good teachers, high-quality equipment and etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It was their goal to bring it with the tap tap so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">from the beginning, I felt the potential that we can tackle the things differently.</seg>
<seg id="68">Often the other copies in show business today.</seg>
<seg id="69">in its own way, it is only logical, because everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after some time.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are few really unique things and, I would venture to say that it includes tap tap.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of the spectators usually has, naturally, is, of course, with suffering; this is just...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and deserted nature, which we regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people living a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if people with disabilities something, this is a step forward not only for themselves, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">It was for this success, it is also helpful that a strict head, how many people are you listening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If you want to make something good, in many things, we must not compromise and must also demand a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">But I think this is quite normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they discover that they have twice the week test preparation must go and spend a lot of time to travel on concert stages, then quickly extinguished the enthusiasm among many.</seg>
<seg id="79">But it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, the tap tap has 20 members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were, from the outset, since 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">only one: LáďA Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group. The people come and go, we cannot prevent.</seg>
<seg id="84">who has the will and the desire to participate, we always welcome.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Poland was last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA as twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member state from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began in 1994 with a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the way the space in Poland began much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">before the Second World War workers Polish Cosmos fans with the space, and they are not always understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I refer for example to the presentation of A. šTernfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, the idea of the author from his pioneering work 'entrance to Kosmonautik'.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (1905), the audience to users, but cold and after years reminded šTernfeld that only Dr Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the year 1934 šTernfeld won for "entrance to Kosmonautik" by Robert Esnault-Prix reps-donated Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Hirsch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was later an important supporter of the astronomy and space.</seg>
<seg id="10">He wrote hundreds of articles and several books published in Polish newspapers to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomskis recognised worldwide contribution to the development of space, inter alia, that the Krater Erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">already in the year 1925 a rail Draisine was built in Poland, was planned for the missile propulsion.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, the author of the text and the details of this project, remained unknown.</seg>
<seg id="14">it is not even clear whether the missile should be used to start or stop the Draisine.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information come solely from the contemporary press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish infantry started to deal with rocket-powered bullets.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research led Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke KomóRka tech Niki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with the Institute and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is clear from the traditional documents that the research into the stage of practical tests was reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the research was then suspended by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937, appeared in the press of the draft a photo from ing. RohozińSki electric rocket, and in the following year, the hunting "raki ETA Torpeda Powietrzna I Rakietobomba Lotnicza 'the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the eve of the war, all the projects on the military use of missile technology from temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-coordinated Naukowy).</seg>
<seg id="23">The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of work was completed its work, however, by the beginning of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another appeared to space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (polskie Towarzystwo Astro Nautyczne) in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">The first mention of this society in the November edition of the magazine problemy in 1954 in the four major articles of the space.</seg>
<seg id="26">The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal of establishing a space company.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time there were already the first projects for satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space future would have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">already in its inception in 1956, the Polish space society PTA to accede to the 1951-based International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA was already 1956 due in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="29">The following year, was the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.</seg>
<seg id="30">In this post he had held until his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">since 1956, the PTA in the forefront of the development of the very successful meteorological rocket (raki ETA Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start was on 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built in 1959 and began in the BłęDóW desert flight tests of the two-stage missile RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed around 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">A further development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work-RM-34 rocket should reach a height of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of high winds.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 1962, however, was the further development.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">RM, the successor to the first missiles of the type Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years from 1962 to 1965.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length of fraud 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">This missile were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), from differences in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport area with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 per litre and Meteor-1C 0,62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum height in all three types of fraud 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the years 1965-1968 was in the aviation institute developed the meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was in a position to make a useful weight of 10 kg in an amount of approximately 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">then the versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is also worth noting the accession of Poland to the cospar (Committee for space research) in 1960, and two years later was followed by the creation of a national COS par-Committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland also participated in the context of the cosmos-programme with Soviet satellites in space research, and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski, after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second international kosmonaut.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not the solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week, the constitutional court the law on voluntary work.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision caused a lively debate in the public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions.</seg>
<seg id="9">To understand this concept is a condition in which the manufacturers trying to import cheaper goods in economic competition, by undercutting the competition "', in order to seize a larger market share and to increase their profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">on a large scale, this means for most companies to transfer their manufacturing abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the private capital is not social responsibility and also bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, are necessarily the spending increase.</seg>
<seg id="12">This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage caused by them.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies will create a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">This manifests itself in particular amendments to existing laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim of these measures is to force its own people, to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is an economic force in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of workers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">for several years in Germany, there are public food distribution to the poor, which are no longer in a position to feed, through their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">in the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly given to cases in which workers such a low salary, that the state must increase their income until the subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">such a scandal was also in the case of workers exposed in the German Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures of practically all EU-Southern States will undoubtedly be in the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a disastrous crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance, on the fringes of society to languish, and I hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is naturally the question of where this capital?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it comes from another EU country, moves the poverty of; or the capital remains the same from one country to another, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt and Africa at work for a fraction of the salaries of the employees.</seg>
<seg id="27">This concerns the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">ad nauseam Liberal theories and the media claim that the state must not involved with capital in its own economy and that economy could lead to economic disaster.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private, parochial, insists on its position that the state should not intervene directly in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">then, however, we must ask whether the private policy and therefore the whole state influenced or even in their own selfish interests.</seg>
<seg id="31">The clear answer is: yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all member states.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation in the field of legislation, the corruption, the mutual benefit, virtually everything is criminally punishable, but nothing.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department lack of finances private, closely interdependent with the industry law firms charged with the preparation of draft legislation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The draft law will be then passed in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">all the violence is no longer, as the western constitutions, but from the people of strong financial groups with their own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Obviously the liberal democracies soon in a situation at the moment, as you APP Ian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic when Caesar and Pompeius' describes: "The state was long in the break, and the offices were filled with violence.</seg>
<seg id="38">bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.</seg>
<seg id="39">corruption has grown incontinent, and people with already buy votes on election "..." people with character applied for not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul "..." we already really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this serious situation was a dictatorship, and that a strong man... should be chosen "APP Ian thought although Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As it turns out, based on today's society as well as in ancient times on the ruthless preference to their own advantage, without overall interests of society.</seg>
<seg id="41">private capital is by its very nature, is not in a position to see the benefit of the whole of society.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result, now as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, not in the slightest for deeper reforms.</seg>
<seg id="43">The reason for the rise of fascism and communism in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economy, we must therefore find systems in the 19th and 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="44">from today's situation, can be regarded as certain break the fall of this regime for the liberal democracies, already in the next round.</seg>
<seg id="45">particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the social and humanitarian disasters, we have already witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know from the history of older and newer, in complete ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="46">The lifting of the law on voluntary work here is not the solution, or at least not lasting.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the level of social security of the population.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore bound.</seg>
<seg id="49">The only solution targeted political and social reforms, the capital increase the state participation in the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the Government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.</seg>

<seg id="22">The first war was aimed to remove the large monarchists States nature of Europe, by the second war should be broken the colonial rule of Britain, in particular, and the third war should reduce the world's population on about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would ensure their comforts and luxury and would not create so many resources), a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the run-up) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order the chaos from Chao-order).</seg>
<seg id="24">But these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed, so that crises such as the one you not repeat triggered in 1907).</seg>
<seg id="25">After you managed by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering the First World War, destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution, the Bolsheviks.</seg>
<seg id="26">The first world war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist, the war was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European power was Austria-Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">In order to be able to make easier the second world war, the bankers by the policy a latent conflict situation by Germany with huge war reparations documented; it created to impoverished masses, so that they had to cheer the German only a sufficiently strong leaders, offered simple solutions, named the guilty and Czechoslovakia; another factor was the creation of the group with a strong German minority, should play the role of a fifth column and also, to the war fire.</seg>

<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in a branch of the establishment of a state for the Jews: JudäAs with Jerusalem as its capital, if possible, at the historic area (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">the Balfour Declaration, mentioned earlier created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first clashes with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">there were terrorist attacks on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke the chain of the international bankers had initially thought, or if everything went according to plan, it is hard to assess, in any case, the plight of European Jews in concentration camps created the basis for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the war reparations was against Germany to prepare the ground for the second world war, the declaration of the state of Israel is the creation of the one point for the third world war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If the international bankers will be able to unlock this war, the Jewish people as the victims in the front line in the fight in the second world war, this time with the Arab and Muslim people of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only within the country itself, but also international (just think of how strongly people into supporters and opponents of Israel).</seg>
<seg id="35">who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where wrong just wrong in an endless spiral of violence, and at the beginning of the greed of the individual and their quest for global power?</seg>

<seg id="36">We must distinguish between the citizens of Israel and its leaders here, but the international bankers, in Israel as well as we, the people, exclusively their own candidates for the election.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current prime minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of a vulnerable, the international bankers fascism loyal politician, of which is doing in order to provoke a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), a global conflict could spread quickly, and with Iran, because of the control on just 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, could come to a destruction of the world economy.</seg>

<seg id="1">The film Argo: if it's the worst Hollywood call</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979 demonstrate a mob of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">for their release, they were asking for the extradition of the deposed shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">There was no positive outcome from this situation for the American government, they could not afford, to throw out the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to retrieve made things even worse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The director and actor Ben Affleck's Argo film describes an episode of this history, gave the United States a small part of the victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">immediately before the occupation of the embassy managed six embassy staff fled.</seg>
<seg id="12">This came after numerous complications in the residence of Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; helping them a flamboyant story on the cover of their true identity-they travelled with Canadian passports allegedly turn in the country disguised as members of a film at the places visited for a science-fiction movie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The combination of genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The plan developed by experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also made the necessary cooperation of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="16">The cover was credible, article published in journals, conferences have been held on this film project and the fictitious production society had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Afflecks film is a particular combination of film genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called 'caper movie "-- the story of a successful Husaren piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.</seg>
<seg id="20">This change in the documentary film the mood levels, on the one side (in the title sequence Ikonische contemporary photographs showed scenes from Tehran, and in the film version of the same situations, there are no great differences).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and easily taken.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions-men in suits at the meeting table, in the official Gallery, on the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck, this film is a remarkable revival of his career.</seg>
<seg id="24">A BeläChelten actor has become a respectable Director, as well as actors, it is now no longer the target of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">argo is his third game film for the thriller not easy (gone baby gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time it is Afflecks first film not in the local Boston director.</seg>
<seg id="27">The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood contrasted with the more general.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran "played" by Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have taken place-the first sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity and feeling yet Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability that comes when moving somewhere the history.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff in a bazaar in Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">too much action in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director also had to face up to the fact that history really does not offer many exciting scenes in cinema sense.</seg>
<seg id="33">with the few working but quite successfully, it helps sometimes, the reality-was not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the impending crisis is averted by a telephone call at the airport in Tehran in America, or the persecution of hunting on the runway, something curious).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is too broad distribution, which is determined by the need to act too much in too many places to show.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman in their roles as Hollywood workers are very charming, but their characters could have more space and they are not alone in the film by far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Afflecks film that loses traction. It is a film, with some interest and the design and the retro-style, reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years Goutieren.</seg>
<seg id="37">He inspires enthusiasm, however difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">Today, in some way as a reminder of a living piece of history and, as proof, such as excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services, but it is enough.</seg>

<seg id="1">directives for bubbles of balloons, for bananas and for the circus</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The server Www.Bankovnipoplatky.Com, the annual survey on the oddest of bank charges, has decided that the competition this year, "most absurd regulation or idea-workshop" from the EU.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"This idea has brought us the plan put forward by the EU, a 40% quota of recently introduced in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, cares about the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the meantime, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they pose a lower risk for insurance companies objectively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Another incredible cases from the workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">One of the controversial EU regulations including the binding mixture of Bioethanol fuel in its wake, nature is harmful to the ban on the reliable contain mercury thermometers, only because this is a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on cages, but because of the size of chicken eggs this year were much more expensive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">criticism has in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "proliferation" or even the sales ban traditional light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">bananas must be 14 cm long</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The EU machine decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in Brussels the rule of one or more member countries (for example, currently Czech Republic is trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks also veto-threat).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">also lobbying interests were behind that bananas from the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and curvature anomaly "must not '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European Commission defended with the argument that it is only the fragmented national standards would impede trade Harmonisiere.</seg>
<seg id="14">The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries have already been softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to the balloons in the sale must be labelled with the suggestion that children under eight years the air balloon without the supervision of an adult to bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU stood on a US study, according to the balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation of children.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restrictions already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of the JahrmarktströTen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">There is also the strange thoughts at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">relatively absurd is also a directive, which concerns the European officials itself-each, an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece must not use the name Macedonia and must instead FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server BankovníPoplatky.Com nominee in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire, in addition to the above-mentioned also the absurdities of the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a member country.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU, the highest volume of food stocks, on the day of our accession to the EU was located on the territory of the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic exceeded the volume of canned mushroom, which we set out, for example, then a large fine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money, but that they have no sea or from the idea of funding requests for aid.</seg>
<seg id="24">But these ideas came not from Brussels, but from Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are at a disadvantage that we have no sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">in the EU, we will apply for reimbursement, "he declared, in the autumn of 2004 the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (čSsd).</seg>
<seg id="27">The argument he gave was that the grain harvest was very high and the state were overcrowded camps as a result of the intervention purchases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Another way because the Czech Republic to the ports, according to Palas, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.</seg>
<seg id="29">Finally, the European Commission, the Czech Republic so far forward that they organised a contract on the purchase of grain from countries, which have no access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">requests for financial aid provided the communities under the auspices of the Ministry of regional development minister Pavel NěMec (US-DEU), it has to be means for the establishment of were requests to Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: bizarre regulations are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">regulations in the member countries are easy targets for criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation and also to effectiveness and development for the whole of the European Union, deserves more recognition according to some experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">These experts believe are a serious problem for the EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations have been imposed by individual member states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">emotions calls here also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight not always wins.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Czech Republic has been following a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the name "Olomoucké TvarůžKy 'defend the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename" TuzemáK ".</seg>
<seg id="36">The name rum must only be used for products from sugar cane distil at, not for products from sugar beet.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">It is not about me, Senator or president.</seg>
<seg id="4">If everything would work without problems in our country, I would get nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">But I can no longer see the Republic being plundered for 20 years, as thieves are walking around freely, while people's taxes and increasing the retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="6">I had no ambitions to be politicians.</seg>
<seg id="7">But if I see something I do not like to propose a solution, then I try to change this.</seg>
<seg id="8">And since I am over 40, independent and party, I have no other opportunity to influence things than to run for Senator or the President.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the Senate, they have managed and then on the road to the castle.</seg>
<seg id="10">Let it not your voters?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">I have said all the time that I will take the fight to the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections in.</seg>
<seg id="12">later clarified this and I said that I will run for the office of the President, if I am elected senator.</seg>
<seg id="13">My aim is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realise my vision.</seg>
<seg id="14">For this, I need as much influence as possible and as a strong mandate.</seg>
<seg id="15">But the problem is not only that we as a people in the pub and the television rant, but any order, want to change something.</seg>
<seg id="16">the media want to deprive the honour and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was claimed, for example, that journalists would bribe, or that I was Jiří Paroubek advisers.</seg>

<seg id="19">The fight to have the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability and with retrospective assets declarations by politicians over 20 million kroner.</seg>
<seg id="20">You will have to change laws.</seg>
<seg id="21">As President, you have no powers in this regard, and the Senate as a whole only legislative proposals.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">as ordinary citizens, I argued that the tour guide is a free trade, and this could be enforced.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is the small-minded policy-if someone from the right or the left is a good proposal is rejected, this deliberately, and considers the people only.</seg>
<seg id="25">as an independent party-I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in parliament.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage is that I think without drawers and dogmas of each party can take what is best for our country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">do they see themselves as man in politics, more to the right or left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">I am from the Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people see more to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">But for me this right-left think is totally unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me, it is important that we can make progress.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is not a question of whether someone to the left or to the right-wing camp; I would unite the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">I support publicly any good solution approach, even if this always comes from the KsčM or of the ODS, and I will oppose bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It is not you, if someone described them as populists.</seg>
<seg id="34">But they did not confirm what you have just said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If you have a business plan in a company, then you are an ideal target and a vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">and they want to be closer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Can I call it populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, functioning in the world already, or they have been discussed by important experts.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">But without support in parliament they just slogans.</seg>
<seg id="39">and they are in politics not far in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="40">or do you believe that you, when you talk only long enough with the people, we will be able, for example, the material and criminal liability?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other option.</seg>
<seg id="42">to convince politicians, journalists and the general public and to try to get them on our side, to achieve these objectives.</seg>
<seg id="43">As President, it would be no problem for me, to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law.</seg>
<seg id="44">and the raised would then say why they may reject it.</seg>
<seg id="45">a strong personality, refers to maladministration can put pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">You only need to look at the direct election of the president, which was a credit to the public pressure.</seg>

<seg id="47">I would like to make it quite clear that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.</seg>
<seg id="49">I have only just started with the policy and attempts to find the support of the majority, for my programme.</seg>
<seg id="50">I always try to do things for themselves to judge; and if it does not work, then I am back in the private sector in six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The Czech Republic should save sounds a little, as if Okamura.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am not a savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that I am hitting alone; I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether or not you want to run for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I have, for example, with Radim JančUra, but rejected because of overwork.</seg>
<seg id="55">I also support the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which exposed the fraud in the trade with easy fuel oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">my candidacy, I started with the premise that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty per cent of the electorate, have not gone to the elections have mostly gone, and the elected representatives of the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">We are only two independent in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people who have elected Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.</seg>
<seg id="60">Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and district main men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">do you think about the creation of a separate party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I have not thought about, because I have no time to review the past any potential party member, and certainly not the money.</seg>
<seg id="63">I have not time money for the presidential campaign; at my transparent account only 20,000 Czk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">They have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">They speak of assets declarations, as would their?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I appreciate my private assets to about 60 million Czk.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a housing for about 10 million, a further 8 million, an art collection, which is worth around 10 million and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and šKodu superb, worth around one million, and then I have a few million to the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Aston Martin was a child's dream-James Bond always liked me, as it was in the car, Galant on women and, at the same time, fought against the evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">They drive an Aston Martin have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for her campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">They say that they want to change the Republic, but you do not want to invest your own money.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have no 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Should I make about debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my programme is not too much interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">and I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign will be basically covered by my salary as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But the senators content I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not to finance the English school, the cost of 30,000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I only wanted money, I would stand for nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">They are further work as entrepreneurs, in order to have their livelihoods?</seg>
<seg id="81">They said that they will drive back these activities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But this is not with the level of salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, I cut my activities in part.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, my deputy director of travel agencies in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="85">People want to see me as Good Samaritans, saving the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I must also bit of life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">You were used as entrepreneurs in which monthly income?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Around 200,000 to 400,000 and that is still the case.</seg>

<seg id="8">The 80,000 residents, community education has the lowest rate in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">in order to counteract this stupid situation, we decided a few years ago, contributing to the general and the seven fictional bridges to emulate the euro notes are presented as nicely Bepinselte reinforced concrete Miniaturen.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the offensive was limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">and so, the city fathers, recognized that there is only one way, should the statistics: a library.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The Rotterdam architecture office Mvrdv Winy Maas, a master of foolhardy beam charts and producer of Witzigen, often cynical buildings, took up the cause with his usual calm and appeared for the competition-hearing in 2003 with five books at the poor and a grin on your face.</seg>
<seg id="13">and while the jury looked Verdutzt and with the Achseln Zuckte Stapelte the impudent maas his splendid Mitbringsel ended according to the size of a pyramid and its Aktionistisch founded speech with the words: "Love city community!"</seg>
<seg id="14">It is, therefore, my proposal for the books mountain of spijkenisse, for the so-called Boeke Mountain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive mountain excavated sites.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is also part of a revitalization project, to the underground car park, supermarket, post office, and a few neighboring residential and row houses with a total of 50 homes.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November, the books Mountain with the second prize was awarded "Best library of NL 2012 '.</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is also nominated for the Dutch national wood award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The faceless town is a test-tube, yet had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, whose white facades would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture richer.</seg>
<seg id="20">But above all spijkenisse now has on the first public culture construction in the history of his existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Long Road to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: books El Dorado under glass.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is a lift to the middle through mountain massive, but the real space open and read delights the foot gap to climb the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The fully Verglaste Atrium is bright and clear, the gun Klinker soil and the elegant city lights clearly speak the language of a public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban atmosphere is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">It has already looking for parking, dog and football-playing boys and bank MäDels.</seg>
<seg id="27">and books, books, books everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally the books shelves along the façade, and in the middle is a large, dark space usually get unpleasant and impersonal way," says Winy maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have read the classic room configuration to the head and the field of Interior externally imposed.</seg>
<seg id="30">The mountain is shrewdly: Home of the books in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environment technology centre and house key.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A particular pleasure, the black book shelves, the time BrüStung wall window dressing, time, time rose close countries.</seg>
<seg id="32">optics Haptik and smell are foreign.</seg>
<seg id="33">even die-hard shake architects and construction engineers whether the unknown building substance the head.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the city municipality spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">and we are in a FriesläNdischen agricultural company a day on an appropriate waste product from agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years in the Netherlands used in greenhouses and fields a fraction of thin plastic fleece a source document.</seg>
<seg id="37">The time is cheap and efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">The slender textile considers two Saisonen, then it is ready for the non-proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="39">The library was the fleece-for the first time in these quantities pressed four-inch thick plates.</seg>
<seg id="40">under heat exposure and pressure VerfäRbt the so-called Landbouwplastic (Klp) to a dark, homogenous, burden-material, Bissl sport shoe after new cars and a Bissl smell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 stages is reached at the summit.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the nearly 500 metres long travels in literature café will not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also with Dutch Kroketten and Eingetopften rewarded ficus trees.</seg>
<seg id="43">They ensure atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literature in the mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">donations for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"It would be not to believe, but this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says despite the many glass land Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">There will be heated and cooled with geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the books under a glass mountain fall, the Sun even on sunny days only briefly to home.</seg>
<seg id="48">The broad wood glue binder across the glass façade, serve as Beschattung and catch a large part of the Sun.</seg>
<seg id="49">The room climate is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The rest fully automated Rollos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon dared, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already leading the way in the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Lisette because the Haig was already.</seg>
<seg id="53">and also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde, Boeke mountain even Spijkenisses "long overdue soul."</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: to open a few weeks ago, any residents invited to donate a book from his personal stock.</seg>
<seg id="55">should start the optical gaps in the still not fully-stocked library-currently 70 piece-filled.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept is deployed.</seg>
<seg id="57">the shelves are filled to the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think now, thanks to our invitation to all inhabitants of a certain relationship with this new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.</seg>
<seg id="61">and if it is only to grace.</seg>
<seg id="62">In doing so, Mvrdv those accepted managed, in the jargon called identity.</seg>
<seg id="63">spijkenisse wrote literary history.</seg>
<seg id="64">They may be so young and uneducated.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is high time that this is a starting point for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "German must play greater role '</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany, which abstained in the vote on the opening of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced Berlin on a fine diplomatic line.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">German wave: the beginning of the week, Germany had first indicated that it opposed the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then the Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="8">now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel must be cautious, however.</seg>
<seg id="9">But, at the same time, I believe that it is also not supported the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">This has finally been enforced by the NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Germany is finding it difficult to adopt a clear position on important international issues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, that is true.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is due to the fact that surrounded his foreign policy and away from a policy was pay, so to speak, of the United States, to a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans find themselves between the fronts.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is expected that a more independent role, but they are not used.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think you buttons to their role, but they are on the path to a more "normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, like France or Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What is a 'normal' foreign policy, specifically from a German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the willingness, in positions of national interests, which are independent from those of the United States or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and why Germany must protect its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be careful to the public, but also the elites, not to offend in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">It plays a role in any case.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would also not want to attach much weight to, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">In any case, but it plays an important role in German thinking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany has its relations with the United States damaged by it has abstained from voting on important decisions, such as on the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">I do not think, therefore, that this was such a dramatic collapse, as in the Libyan issue.</seg>
<seg id="34">maybe Germany will play even a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">because it signals that it must be taken into account as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">There are different views in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States, on the other hand have been clear for a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are differences between the United States and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">because the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the Obama administration has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But because of the political situation here, the government can not represented this position publicly, of course.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real differences are not so great as they seem.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then it is Obama, not so upbeat of Netanyahu's policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Germany is finding it difficult, his close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other side?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="47">so you can not be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">that they do so with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future, to press Europe to a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">This has always been a sensitive issue.</seg>
<seg id="52">I believe, however, that the German, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Germany to see itself in the role as an important international players-Germany wants to play a major role?</seg>
<seg id="54">or is the lead Germany still difficult?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country, to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">For example, if we look at the Euro crisis, every time when Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="57">that makes it the German is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is, in fact, the old problem: you do not be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">So Germany is in a more difficult position than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy continues, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who remains otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you do not like it is inconvenient for them and they will be much less popular, c'Est la vie.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">an Armani is also a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is an Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">behind it is a very officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the companies.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, it enjoys protection, as long as the actual name donors did not complain.</seg>
<seg id="6">and even then, it is not clear whether they are right.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It will be increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the firm Taylor Wessing, specialising in protection of rights violations in the far east.</seg>
<seg id="8">Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">the clones are a few extra letters so that they can register their trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="10">So Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, Prada, Prada-Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">German companies will also be legally copied in this way, the sports goods manufacturers Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">stalemate hole opens up a raft of registering the trademarks Bureau in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company that protect trademarks Zegna DF puma, an art, and also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Chinese world champion injured in copy and intellectual property, is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the big cities there is MehrstöCkige department stores sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the stalemate hole cases are different: on behalf of his client, it is that Chinese companies are the trademarks Agency officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call the "bang Ming Pai, a passenger brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">Based on the floor "bang Dakuan."</seg>
<seg id="19">So are women, rich men angling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"It is bad for business, it must combat 'calls for stalemate hole.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand will be watered down, the position alone, the damage is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The cost of financial losses and the process of the industries affected are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market research society CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third largest market for luxury goods and is the fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But erased dubious entries in the register trademarks are difficult to achieve and go into money.</seg>
<seg id="26">up to nine years, the process can drag on, with uncertain results.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch reported cases in which the court authorities because, after the long duration of the reported name to "market had become reality."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff misfortune, must pay the Plagiator even money because he injured, says stalemate hole its brand in China.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">famous cases relate to graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company, which recently took over the German concrete pump Bauer putzmeister.</seg>
<seg id="32">To date, the Chinese must therefore use a symbol that resembles the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Volvo-buyer Geely, originally used a blue and white logo, BMW recalled; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Lacoste fashion manufacturers lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.</seg>
<seg id="36">the trademarks agency Ctmo in Beijing is that there are bottlenecks 2010 due to lower personnel and facilities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Last year, however, one of the "emergency situation in business returned to normal life."</seg>
<seg id="38">So is the Unbearbeiteter appeals procedure was about 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">57, 000 such cases have been completed, almost 75 per cent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, still 81.500 appeals in the office waiting for execution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It costs a lot</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last year the Ctmo more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record and China means that for the tenth consecutive year, the list of new applications in all the world, shares the authority.</seg>
<seg id="45">that also applies to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million head.</seg>
<seg id="46">In 2011, had been taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">On average, means that any registration simplified 1280 yuan or costs EUR 160.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">It costs a lot, as the case of the German family company freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="49">for more than seven years, the company has been struggling against a Chinese Plagiator.</seg>
<seg id="50">Although the German could achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitation of motor vehicle parts was unearthed.</seg>
<seg id="51">But secured the freudenberg followers continue the Chinese rights to the brand.</seg>
<seg id="52">We have failed in this, as in Germany, family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">the trademarks agency Ctmo rejected the objection of the Munich back.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the next two bodies, freudenberg, opponents of the law, but the process is continuing until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">You must watch your step</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs could hardly figures the company archives have even one hundred years old need to look through files in order to provide evidence.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago, freudenberg offered the opposition a "high six-digit code amounts" to settlement in vain.</seg>
<seg id="61">"That shows how much we value," says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers in the Far East to places even after Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">that is, if there imitators vulnerable brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">It was a Chinese manufacturers in Germany the name freudenberg for shoes and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, this business has abandoned the company long, he could avert the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"You must watch your step," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the lawyer Pattloch rates German companies to be very careful in doing business with China.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, much more should the foreigners "somehow everything is worth protecting, also registered in China," as Wentzler says.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, can be much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact, if freudenberg in the last act of his trademark drama is governed, then it is the other side pay royalties on their own behalf, Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">or, in the segment in question, we will be squeezed out of the market.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="50">Our insights into space: The main Teleskope</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope will be Hans Lipperhey invented 1608-even before Galileo Galilei began to observe stars on it a year later.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirror of the optical Teleskope increasing-and the insight they provide deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, the Hale telescope at the palomar observatory near San Diego was the world's largest long-distance pipe.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">in Arizona, the United States, the large binocular telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">It can look into space on two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">the inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge-alone the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">the mirror of the southern African large telescope in southern Africa is segmented-in order to save costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless it has a diameter of about 11 metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">The disadvantage of good design: the telescope is in his corner of here-and so in limited his mobility.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is in view.</seg>
<seg id="62">its characteristic: the high light collection force.</seg>
<seg id="63">This is despite comparatively low mirror diameter, to the world's largest mirror Teleskope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the help of a radio telescope at arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers all aliens signals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.</seg>
<seg id="66">In the "search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti) anyone can help by computer owners he would available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Look at the Observatory of European Sternwarte (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here is the very large telescope-worthy of its name.</seg>
<seg id="69">with its four lights from the distance pipe can also reflect the medium-sized infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory will be the European extremely large telescope.</seg>
<seg id="71">Its main mirror will include hefty 42 metres-and almost a thousand mirror elements.</seg>
<seg id="72">But with images is 2018 at the earliest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">By 2007, were the two Keck-Teleskope in the Hawaiian root volcano Mauna Kea, as the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">They offer two levels, with an average of 10 metres.</seg>
<seg id="75">the Keck-Teleskope are part of Mauna Kea Observatory, among them with the Subaru telescope and the Irttf looking towards the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope-- an average of 30 metres with a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is an illustration to gaze at.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">However, the most important impressions from the provides all the space telescope Hubble.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since the 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler is looking for extra-solar planet-mainly in the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="81">On 2 February 2011 was announced by NASA that identified 1235 planet candidates since the mission began.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the picture are the last start preparations on the space telescope Kepler documented.</seg>

<seg id="84">The space infrared telescope's primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: it should seek the light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume that also exists on the south pole of the Mercury ice.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there is no reliable data, because underpins the messenger far closer to the North Pole for the planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">For decades, have radar measurements suggest that the Mercury ice.</seg>
<seg id="89">By 2004, Messenger-tube-launched the first, which underpins the mercury-the scientists have now certainty.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rakfisk from Norway: is this the üBelriechendste fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards-and not only in Europe but throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">The secret of the success of the country could have something to do with the local appetite for quite evil smelling fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">take a selection on mature cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">Platziere you in the midst of a crowd of dirty, more humid sports clothing.</seg>
<seg id="6">and leave it there for a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">that we must imagine the NasenbetäUbenden smell of Rak Fisk, one of the most delicate of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is snow, spectacular landscapes-and this persistent smell in the air, simply will not disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is best reute trout with salt-depending on how Stinkend his fish would like-to up to a year in water ferments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">When the darkness in Norway about the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians to a celebration here in fagernes, this now really very Bestechenden speciality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"you eat it raw and SpüLt it down with a glass of Aquavit, 'says Havard Halv arsenic, working in the local fire station, but as the so-called" Rak Fisk-General', also held the festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">small fish eat people around us and decided to take large quantities of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"It was people like the Aquavit more than the Rak Fisk," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The spirit can crowd out the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I tried some chunks.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it avoids the Rak Fisk in general vicinity, it is not bad-such as sushi, which has a long bus ride.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rak Fisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cold and wet fish in the air dense salt water barrels in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="19">in deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and subdued end-- no doubt with the help of alcohol consumed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians on the forced to leave their country in search of work and decreased mainly in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Today, the population is growing rapidly-more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not too long ago was much richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is seen as something important-as a vital, if strictly Riechender part of Norwegian history.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is one of the more expensive courts, which you can buy here.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, everything here is really expensive-a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs EUR 10 proud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not often in the press, and the most people seems not to interfere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Still, Anders Breivik hates it name-the racist right-wing extremists last year 77 men, women and children shot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, refers only to the "incident on 22 July."</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in their peace-loving country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">the main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970's, growth is one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the only reason why we are so well off," says Anna, our waitresses, the round Tabletts mature Rak Fisk, distributed and enthuse people with her long blond hair, and embodies the Stechend blue eyes of the Nordic ideal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are, as they say, sensible people.</seg>
<seg id="33">their English is exactly as the most people here impeccable.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are not very Angeberisch, we may not boasting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway is very careful with its oil wealth-a large part of the industry profits will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">in the years leading up to the world economic crisis, all with money raised, that they had not considered Norway closed its purse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we can go go go skiing in winter and in summer, we are happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"and, of course, RAK Fisk to eat," she adds with Unbeschwertem laugh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I am in the snow and am I have enough for another court-Rak Fisk.</seg>
<seg id="40">In any case, so an Elk Burger is something else. enjoy the juicy meat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But the evening is the Stinke fish on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel, in the event I Logiere is one of several places a Rakfisk organise dinner where guests for the best-- or perhaps the most challenging fish smell sense can vote.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a live-TV line to a fly shirted Showmaster, surrounded by tables with RAK Fisk.</seg>
<seg id="44">The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What marks you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"here are our points, Havard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We note and laughs.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man is overwhelmed by his seat, possibly of Aquavit.</seg>

<seg id="8">Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico can prove economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has claimed 60,000 lives in the past six years.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="19">In particular, with regard to the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He was a man of very direct, very committed and have great plans for the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">Above all, he was a great statesman, but it also is someone who can listen.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza to the paved roads of Valle del Bravo, the contrast could not be greater.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="44">If President Pena Nieto receives the President cement on Saturday, he is also a great responsibility.</seg>

<seg id="7">In a cross-examination Mannings during a court hearing in ft. Meade, Maryland said Maj. Ashden Fein, documents to weekly visit, prison officials had made at Mannings nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">A day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request from the defence to reject the charge-manning is the hard prison time had already been punished enough-manning testified that he had considered suicide in prison.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The US army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of during his tenure in Iraq of thousands of confidential documents stolen.</seg>
<seg id="10">The material was then published on the Internet by Wikileaks.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At the hearing on Friday was fine with manning the forms by the officials after their meeting with manning during his detention at Quantico military prison, where he had filled from July 2010 to April 2011, increased detention had sat.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">Officials said Manning wrote questions and his answers.</seg>
<seg id="14">as Sinn Fein questioned him Friday to the forms, he was manning that the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole had assessed as "very professional".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The forms, so beautiful, contained no complaints about ill treatment, even though officials had asked manning directly on his treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Manning said he had concerns expressed orally and the officials have discussed this with him and, to deal with this, but they had not been recorded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"They wrote 'no problems' (after meeting the concerns), and not necessarily meant that I said nothing," Manning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The judge, Col. Denise Lind, manning also asked why he had not complained about his treatment, in January 2011, when he met with a committee of the suicide idea mentioned by him a few months earlier, on a form should investigate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Manning said his intention during this meeting have insisted that his observation status for "prevention of injury" downgrading.</seg>
<seg id="20">The military said it had him this status-a stage under the restrictive suicide risk-on his and the protection of others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"I wanted to convince people that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status on the prevention of injury (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.</seg>

<seg id="26">I thought I would die in this cage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">When he was transferred to Quantico, manning spent most of his days in a small cell-at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours-and without society.</seg>
<seg id="28">We have him only a mattress and a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.</seg>
<seg id="29">Manning said he tried to stay on the move, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even on the ground.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">He had always sleep with light, the outside his cell.</seg>
<seg id="31">If he turned at night and see could not see his face, it was well-versed him so that he can turn back the clock.</seg>

<seg id="8">I grew up in central California, and my life has been called "Mexicans."</seg>
<seg id="9">An ethnic acronym-just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, I opted for "between Mexico-American."</seg>

<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">and in the home in my grandfather's day, there was no need for acronyms or Hyphenation.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just Americans.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish well enough, at least for me in this language at both ends of the interviews.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the vocabulary of a mother spoke Lers and my American accent I will also not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda of all those issues which are expected when the heads of the two countries, immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today with the same likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc model of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">and Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war in Mexico against the drug cartels, although he gave no details in this regard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans are probably never a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country, perhaps gun, forced to leave more than half its territory to them.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans in centuries and are not in minutes, memories of this event not to overlook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Therefore, once a US government officials only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country's complaints about how the Americans press their neighbouring country's sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="26">monte cripple Zuma and the children are on the war path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Yet, in truth, is the biggest challenge of Mexico in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inclination to talk about resentment?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has winners and losers. People, provide opportunities for the country, and others, for which it does not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree of life a person-a parents' or grandparents' part, perhaps no chance offered in Mexico and in the north.</seg>
<seg id="32">and in most cases, this person is a profile-dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to you.</seg>
<seg id="34">not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">and though we might now live the American dream have visited, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, we live-not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">our identity is sometimes blurred, but perhaps what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is clearly the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leaders may not.</seg>
<seg id="39">This is based on reciprocity.</seg>
<seg id="40">they see us as a monument of a humiliating defeat and looking down on us, because we are not between Mexico and enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">In their view, our very existence is a symbol of the failure.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="43">If our families not failed, then they would not have gone in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="44">and then we would not see trapped behind the silk curtain-with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">my wife was born in Guadalajara and went to the United States legally as a child, I am reminded that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, also have a clearer idea of who they are, because Mexicans and Mexican Americans taking this evil.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the US-American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">But many Mexican Americans, I know, have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the Mexican band los tigres del norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">and we will be seen as Mexicans in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">as I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complex: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">You want Mexican Americans as a provisional 'ambassador' for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American colleagues of how great a visit to this country and to exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">now.</seg>
<seg id="56">that will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">many wounded feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">and given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I am afraid, because you alone, Amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">that is only fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready for dealing with Mexico, the United States awarded to one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members have been dealt with until not so long ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are 'Mexican' as I thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">old wars, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected pillars for peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">can it ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest bloody events seem such a hope to nip in the bud.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the midst of the usual recriminations countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find their end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war lost or gained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">at first glance seems optimistic in view of the current situation is anything but.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group had even large losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desolate and most densely populated corners of the planet will be loaded, it is Israel which, until now, has not managed to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Indeed, the Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">and Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a revival, regional power, which was once known as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas party-as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.</seg>
<seg id="19">Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that an Islamic crescent-Israel from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, Syria, where rebels an increasingly more Islamist-style StüRzung Bashar Assad's face, to Jordan, where Hamas allies could threaten the King.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">President Muhammad Mursi and, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the inhabitants of most and most important Arab country-on Israel's southern flank has changed the balance of the region sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="21">The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had only a little time left for Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast, the Brotherhood VerschwäGert with Hamas and their leaders are more dependent on people's views.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic negotiations could prove the Hamas as an actor, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Israeli hardliners, however, let the opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">Militarily speaking, Hamas is no longer dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli anti-missile system, "iron dome" can prove its worth and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Israel will not be able to sleep more easily for at least a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic terms, the United States remain firm in its position, many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Israel, have fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed 30 Israelis, since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the non-proliferation of the plants in the West Bank and that into the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. To protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared illegal, however, continue to be developed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Netanyahu is good. his Likud party in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, Avigdor Lieberman has allied with a more combative group.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why this nanny behind wily Palestinians and leave them in a state of their own?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you really have the control over the West Bank, would you then do not exactly as their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip, firing missiles?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and to punish them if they dare to raise the heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">It may be that the hardliners prevail, but the Arab spring could make you a line by the court.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in their own country.</seg>
<seg id="37">Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="38">A war with the local super power the new Arab governments will hardly help repair their economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">that the pragmatic president Mursi with Barack Obama, together, in order to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign-and perhaps represent the beginning of a new era.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">The Israelis should also think long-term.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination, a powder keg, which no doubt one day will explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, as well as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.</seg>
<seg id="42">the repression now is undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.</seg>
<seg id="43">bloody missions for the eradication of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be increasing its diplomatic toll over the years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">both sides need a boost from foreign</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">the right answer is those by the representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and more will be represented by this newspaper: two states where Israel for security purposes, areas with its tail between its legs.</seg>
<seg id="46">The small-- for the near future hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.</seg>
<seg id="47">together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt must now stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and to convince a shared Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">outsiders, Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="49">that would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Obama must also play its part to induce Israel to negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">far away in the White House, it seems as if he is as a participation.</seg>
<seg id="53">But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States have a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">and it includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging in Australia entered into force, so that will brand logos and colours are replaced by neutral Oliv green lid, moreover, with drastic use images, which show health body parts and cigarette smoke sick babies and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Apart from the different health warnings and pictures from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs in the brand name are printed in identical, small letters.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australia leads the world's strictest rules on tobacco packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">the Australian Federal Government to divert young people from smoking by the GlamouröSe picture of tobacco consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government of studies that have shown that people with 26 have not started to smoke, with 99% of disabled likely will not start after.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We can already see in young children age that you understand the message, the tobacco companies trying to compete with their brand image," Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoted studies have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, and the changes have little impact on the profits of the multinationals, other countries already are considering similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">the tobacco lobby fought hard against the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="11">So it was with the laws would trade on the black market, which will lead to cheaper cigarettes and easily accessible.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The legislation will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Others, however, say that the laws have driven their business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses Etuis, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicone Cap to cover the intolerable packaging, has grown enormously since the companies, British American Tobacco, Britain's imperial tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco Australia two months ago, the supreme court challenge to the legislation failed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesale business and await new stocks.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is a good business for us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media in exactly the population to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="19">A number of an Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, it prohibits them as sport sponsors and most traders, cigarettes in shops are no longer forced to interpret. Now the tobacco advertising on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local businesses and sides, but has no influence on international sides.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Tobacco is marketed and has left only a small area, to bid for its products is around the Internet does not," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On social media such as YouTube, twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen a rise in experience to brands, which were written by "ordinary people".</seg>
<seg id="23">The question: is this just a private person who enjoyed Marlboro cigarettes, so that even incorporates a video-or has a marketing agency to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than marketing focus to deal with the new laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It has even gone so far as to pay, the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic, to challenge the new rules, those countries in the World Trade Organisation to complain about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries greater trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">a WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries, considering the similar packaging laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was the first country in 2001, the photographic warnings wrote.</seg>
<seg id="29">These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">many Australian show smokers defiantly.</seg>
<seg id="32">The images do not affect me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I simply ignoring them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It is simply a touch and the box way," says Victor el Hage buy a packet of cigarettes on the printed a photograph with a mouth tumour.</seg>
<seg id="35">to be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that is my little girl.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">in a constantly Elektrisierten world, it is also time to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Unexpectedly, this Thanksgiving I spent five hours in the airport as the plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for other airlines.</seg>
<seg id="3">So I had enough time for me to make a few thoughts to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I do not want to lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite NervtöTend-even if books, magazines and Iphones available (and tax-free shopping, of course).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But more and more academics and child development experts boredom as something positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">If it were up to you, it is for us, and our children-ok, sometimes to be bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">in interesting, so that the brain is forced to trains to lose what is perhaps the creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">and because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen that benefit us the benefits of boredom, not more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We should welcome the boredom with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">and no.</seg>
<seg id="13">I will come back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "boredom: a lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Indeed, boredom has a very long history," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">The house walls Pompejis fault a Latin inscriptions on boredom, which goes back to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually.</seg>
<seg id="19">John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is defined in many ways and has been discussed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, "a satisfactory job, but not to be able to define".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Consequently, boredom, differs from apathy to the effect that the person does not want to be employed, but this.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, in the case of the apathy that there is no rush to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The key experience boredom, he says, in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad tempered and the feeling that the time passes slowly."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">boredom can almost hear such as depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes, we believe that US is dull, even if we just have to focus on.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their study, "the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention" in German, for example: "the UntäTige sense: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which appeared in the journal perspectives on psychological science "in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues listening to an earlier experiment, the participants a band, a person read a magazine article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, had nothing to do with the content. others heard it at the lower level, so it is barely perceptible hear these noises, while the third group was not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The people who barely audible or listening to television, gave more boring than the other two groups feel they have had problems to focus, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of Neuroscience at the University of guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">However, if you have a tedious activity, "as the search for defective products to help distract a factory conveyor belt, music and not to feel bored."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln often interpreted as signs of boredom can fight, even by people who remain physically more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"studies have shown that children who keep Herumhampeln, learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We will all eventually boring-my delayed flight, a film, a particularly Shun dull DröHnender loudspeaker.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people bore more easily than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">researchers to measure these differences, developed a scale to boredom in the 1980's vulnerability. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">on the Richter scale, statements such as' many things I have to do and are monotonously repeat "and" I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of such scale, researchers have found that young is more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general, teenagers are a fairly Abgespannter bunch.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents by seven or eight times a day with a pager Kontaktierte.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and do the homework, while 23% claims to be bored if they were not in school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">But only 3% of the parents said to feel bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages are about boredom has risen or fallen.</seg>
<seg id="44">He was sure, however, that "the youth is seen as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily lives end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So, back to my original question: is boredom, healthy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">in the extreme, sometimes not, because it leads people into extreme physical risks to take and the gambling or drugs to alleviate it, studies have shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, many philosophers and authors analyse the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"With the boredom, the brain wants a say, that we should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain do not always know just what you should do the best.</seg>
<seg id="50">If a is dull and the energy used to be and to cook, we will be happy to play Gitarre.</seg>
<seg id="51">But television may evaporate for good feelings to ensure this in the short term but in the long term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So who has spent his child an Ipad is enough, it can distract you from the boredom. It has not learned to maintain itself or to control, says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">and he adds: "self-regulation is a situation on the other."</seg>
<seg id="54">The child learns not only to have more self-control, but also in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not believe that we should celebrate for long time.</seg>
<seg id="56">We should also not critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead, our aim should also at ease from the permanent AktivitäTs- and technology sprinkling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"It sounds so than we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something useful," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">In fact, he believes that the people just looking for a way to switch off and relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment in which we constantly be stimulated, it is difficult to deal with, once the noise has fallen silent."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">in Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime before a court in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few tasks and a marijuana pipe, he smoked as this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day, with the drive to Kansas in Lamar near the border, when they were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug supplies-excusable peccadilloes, which are equipped with a penalty of $100, and was given a court date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But it is also a?</seg>
<seg id="7">in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, depends on the answer to hundreds of smaller less by law, as the location for drug offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of offences to be marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, approved similar measures, have already dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police authorities are adults over 21 years for possession of a small extent. This is no longer legally permitted to enter into force as soon as the new legislation in the next few weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in the more conservative counties in Colorado have announced that existing quote marijuana offences and people are still before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, Denvers votes in several cities, from the suburbs to the western mountains, new state licensed marijuana business to the opening in their communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which lies east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">and regulators in the state of Washington are confused on the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are waiting for a guide to setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug-and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">The view in Washington is that Colorado is in any case most of the states ahead, as regards the regulation of marijuana. There was legalized the drug for medical purposes, and then for private consumption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market. the state lends itself so well to guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Smith also that there is no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent, we can follow," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and is also the end of a grey area in the state licensing system does not yet exist, but legalized the possession.</seg>
<seg id="20">and unpleasant practice issues have to be resolved in this time-such as the government's target of a "fair access" to Lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops in a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare should be agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"No, it will be difficult to find a location for a Lizenziertes cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the urban area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis', a recently formed group research.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">its staff in Aurora on 21 November, chief Oates sent an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana offences in people over the age of 21 years, and that the police "immediately" will not seek criminal advertisements for these offences.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County in northern colorado County prosecutor Ken buck a stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to encourage consumers to withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently, 119 people in possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana trial, although many were also charged for other offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our authority has a duty to pursue violations, in which the crime was" indeed stage, buck said in a statement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions are, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police circle in grand junction, the largest city of the country, no longer shows adults for the possession of small quantities.</seg>
<seg id="30">District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also not decided to drop all outstanding possession proceedings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I do not believe that I waste my time to enforce the law until it is changing," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the start that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana to reconcile with the complexities of the Government and the legal system.</seg>
<seg id="33">and the contradictory reactions in the whole state promoted among local officials a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">District Prosecutors if it was a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer representing the defendants on trial for marijuana crimes from Denver, and on the ground acting as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"They have spent such a large part of their lives, to prosecute people for that you still cannot accept the legalization," he believes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The first states, the smaller treat marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington, acted as a national model for the legalisation of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While advocates and state officials to prepare a legal age sales, they are also nervous waiting for orders from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level continue to treat as a crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">A spokesman for the legalization Movement hope that the Justice Department will give.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers medical Marihuanas, the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama government is of the view that law is probably no doors, reluctant to smaller quantities of drugs seized, but probably will, under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops to tolerate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">several cities in Colorado, not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the polling day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana business, although this is only open in about a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Montrose, a town in the west, decided last week to a six-month ban, which will probably be next week.</seg>

<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: I was from Oxford Gemobbt because I am a Tory</seg>
<seg id="2">not only attacked university students today for their views</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">It has always been my biggest dream, to be given a place at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had visited the university I once considered to be the largest know Temple in the world, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilisation-- free thinking and tolerance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester college in the late 1980s, where I had intended to study history-I had my suitcase again and so the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed in tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">my friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Evening Standard said it, I would, because I had a problem with that fellow students in a neighbouring room had sex.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author of a n Wilson said mischievously, I would leave the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But the truth was less amusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">I went away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, well, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.</seg>
<seg id="13">not because of my unusual name, or because I was from a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">I was harassed for one reason only-a reason in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment to narrow and now seemed cruel: my late father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I have been an advocate of the Conservative Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why do I mention this now?</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students suffering the moderate right under similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has developed such dimensions that called for a group of them last week, the same equal rights protection to the benefit of gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">conservative members of the junior common room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi college, you will be isolated because of their political views "often actively, personally attacked and" declared undesirable.</seg>
<seg id="19">They call for a place in the Equality Committee of their college, to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The situation was aggravated by a recent documentary on political students screened on BBC two, "wonderland: young, bright and on the right," the Tories as Eccentrics and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">It has been shown, among other things, a graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative Association of Oxford University, in a Rolls-Royce and Silberfarbenem Protzte suit and silver occupied or stock.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">other universities say conservative students, they are seen as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".</seg>
<seg id="23">The 20-year-old Luke black, vice-president of the conservative students Association of the University of Nottingham, was left in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing trend in universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people believe we are as the Bullingdon Club, without us even to have got ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable." the 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-designate of the conservative student association of Oxford says they have JRC Members observed a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members', she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In my first few weeks at Oxford I was such a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">As I was unbelievably timid 18-year-old arrived in September 1986.</seg>
<seg id="29">hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the university had voted in favour of Margaret Thatcher-a former student-because of cuts in higher education to give no official title.</seg>
<seg id="31">the atmosphere had even Stalinists squirm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">in the first days of the first-week semester in the new students and Tutoren acquaintance, I got a taste of the future events.</seg>
<seg id="33">I made the experience that the students not only Duldeten Tutoren the mockery of Tory, but even attended it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">political issues such as the miners' strike, privatization and the rejection of the sanctions against the apartheid government of South Africa found their way into the HolzgetäFelten spaces of the Tutoriums.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first of these events should I French texts translated into English from the 18th century to what then should have been taken, I was not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt", translated as "the tutor said Harry Pitt (died) now," the first paragraph, please.</seg>
<seg id="37">I stumbled.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt was a small man with a face as creation from cake, and quite unpleasant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Thatcher-supporters refuse to learn French, or are they simply stupid?" he asked me.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students Kicherten.</seg>
<seg id="41">Wallten tears in my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that you take a few French in their leisure time hours-in other words, if they are not too preoccupied with their social activities' Knurrte Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned with HäNgendem head in my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">This evening I sat alone at the dinner in college, when I Tippte someone easy on the back.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was an English student from the second year on behalf of James, a member of the conservative Student Association.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said gently.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it is as it is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Everyone suspected, Tory to be harassed.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most Tory first semester, a supporter of the Labour Party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Later, in a local pub, I tried to forget.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs Thatcher was in all respects.</seg>
<seg id="53">This ploy should prove unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="54">A first in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, visited the Eton College as a conservative, said to me: 'You are the daughter of a fascist pig. "</seg>
<seg id="55">you are polluted.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students shared his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverse and bad way.</seg>
<seg id="58">"As the Tories have sex? 'asked me.</seg>
<seg id="59">the other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt so how homosexuals have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">I would ever be able to Oxford University to lead a normal life?</seg>
<seg id="62">I would like-minded can make only after the collapse of the darkness?</seg>
<seg id="63">I should like to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural instincts?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years before me were gradually, my intellectual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only tutor, to recognise the open as Tory, it was Norman stone, a professor of contemporary history, had its headquarters in my college.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not only was he hated to be a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of external policy, and wrote speeches for them.</seg>
<seg id="67">He was only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place it was insular and narrow and rejected him for his Marxist-Deterministische historical perspective.</seg>
<seg id="69">In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You will not be happy," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began to commute between Oxford and the House my parents and took refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city.</seg>
<seg id="72">I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">He seemed incredulous.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his time in the Vierzigern all political views were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.</seg>
<seg id="76">This is not something they would never do, in my city of TräUmenden Tower alarm.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends always impeccable manners.</seg>
<seg id="78">his wet eyes marred.</seg>
<seg id="79">then the whole a chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am sure Neckt you.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break my heart if you gingst.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance was weaker.</seg>
<seg id="83">One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and abdicated his convictions.</seg>
<seg id="84">During a Tutoriums seriously in the following week, another history tutor had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Although I secretly Zerging in shame, I was that my parents had undergone a "brainwashing" and called them "old dunce."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The relief lasted only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was my father, which is the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford-career.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">my door was closed.</seg>
<seg id="90">I hid me in my room, and after five minutes gave my persecutors.</seg>
<seg id="91">as they walked, Packte I a suitcase and took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never returned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">like you can a Weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.</seg>
<seg id="94">But 18-year-olds should ever in any educational institution suffer such intimidation and spite.</seg>
<seg id="95">and it is even more tragic is that it was Oxford-a university, not only had 14 Tory Prime Minister, but up to now hiding behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.</seg>

<seg id="2">The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, of the sixth meeting of the presidents of the Union of South American nations (Unasur) Summit was held in Lima in Peru, told the state television that the Europeans "in the second world war and other conflicts were killing" and "are now virtually a homeland."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the members states of the Unasur.</seg>
<seg id="5">"must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, however, there is still a reactionary sectors who want to see a return to the past," he warned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The President of Ecuador, also supported the reform of the Organisation of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take account of those who have signed the San José agreement on human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The lessons, never commit themselves to something, and, in return, we sign the South Americans always do everything.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and will be financed by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, has granted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa stressed that he did not regret this decision, because it will not have betrayed his principles, but his "complied with deep democratic values and views on human rights".</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that there have been "well-founded suspicions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and non-compliance with the procedures."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which he asked for him to submit to interrogation because of alleged sex crime on its territory, while the Swedish legislation allows it via a video conference on the embassy of Ecuador in London can be carried out. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa said that the danger that would undermine the health and mental state of Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">"since he is in our message is, I have not talked to him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but it is not serious," said the head of Ecuador.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">There is a danger, though, that he is physical and mental damage forgiven because he was caught in a narrow area and could not carry out physical exercises in free.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It would be detrimental to the health of all people," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa was that the solution to the asylum, Assange has been granted since the month of June in the embassy of Ecuador in London, the granting of a free letter which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of Europe's Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities. He emphasised that there have been talks with London in order to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of Wikileaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not act with human rights, we turn this word in this case not to have permanent talks.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution for this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar GarzóN, a number of procedures at various European bodies," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">and "when Britain granted licence tomorrow, in my opinion, this is done."</seg>
<seg id="20">and if Sweden Mr Assange at the embassy of Ecuador in London or on Skype VerhöRte made, as the Swedish law permits, and in other cases, was the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa used the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that he will not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the sinister intention and the lie that infringe the freedom of expression."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the biggest enemy of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists, the pursuit of profit and blackmail," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador that not more of such journalists' and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and tables bourgeois countries', and I think he will be a re-election "will deepen the revolution in order to continue moving in the right direction."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa also supported the decision to veto against Paraguay in the Unasur maintain at least until the next elections, arguing that the legal body must remain "hard and no opportunism and no Verkleideten May coup d'éTat," because "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The President of Ecuador is also keeping the desire his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, and now after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which before the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime legal limits between the two countries, for "absolutely justified."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This judgment will not be implemented at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a problem between a South and Central American state.</seg>

<seg id="29">They must be dealt with, so that they can be overcome and look forward.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the sea border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said, "it is right for Latin America that recourse to international bodies, if both countries undertake to adopt the ruling, even if it is very harsh."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">in relation to the possibility that he, as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third mandate in a row, he admitted that he "with a lot of optimism and joy this possibility, though it is sometimes very difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa promised that if he could lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.</seg>

<seg id="1">The cause of a dying because AIDS is now a late detection</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if a bombshell," he says of the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success "tried to weaken."</seg>
<seg id="4">He hid it from his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided to look just about his illness and began to inform; and that with such use, that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the hospital civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fight in 1994.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the time, avoiding even the director of a clinic of the Imss to adopt "because it led to a dead end."</seg>
<seg id="9">AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, there are still many people in the hospital, unaware of their disease and where the virus has already been damage, your immune system has outlived its usefulness, and the victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Thirty years after the incidence of AIDS in the world, in other words after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of patients, the treatment time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information was backed by a prominent scientific publication in April this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life of the extent of the damage to the immune system attached to the people at the start of treatment, and that those who have greater opportunities, which are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a count of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, the above remarks mean that anyone who gets diagnosed HIV-positive in the 25 years of age "can easily be 75 years old, in this sense, as long as it is under control," said the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Even if the mortality has decreased significantly in the last few years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, 6.678 cases in 2007 to reduce the Onusida 4.862 in 2011 (annual report)), it is nevertheless true that since the AIDS died 60% of patients covered in the national database.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Jalisco, in 2011 255 people died alone, and until the month of May this year, there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">So people still die-why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is my opinion, and that is in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any problems with the drugs, the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their infectious State, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He makes a striking statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have a lifelong infection. Earlier diagnoses are needed in order to influence the global mortality, why all the people where this is necessary, must be offered screening massively."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This proposal, the experts and officials of the consejo estatal de PrevencióN del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio, carry out the test at a private laboratory, and the only reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS-phase and even had the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancer tumor), which is the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and we want to hear.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I die, then three times burst," says in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The amendment was to improve, I ErnäHre me well, sport and take note of the medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">We now know his parents that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I am standing much, have an active, but responsible sex life, I respect on my health and that of the other person," one Fabrizio, the agreed to his intimate details with Milenio Jalisco to share, with his testimony to encourage those who are today within the framework of the World AIDS Day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live as all the people responsible.</seg>
<seg id="32">his message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">There are large holes between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has adopted the cause of HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">and the most important thing is prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">The increases in certain places, "the distribution of condoms actually was; previously they were individually, now give us packages to hundreds of piece, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">The high-risk individuals for new infections among young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"What need you?" is a question of widespread ridicule of social workers, staff orientation in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to expose, assured the correspondent.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in issuing equipment in public toilets facilities, often visited by young people.</seg>
<seg id="40">It should not be promoted promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">It should not be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question on whether under its management would be distributed condoms.</seg>
<seg id="42">"sexuality is not; it is best, the condoms to bring it closer to those who already have a sexual activity", brought it to the point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">key data of Jalisco</seg>
</p>

<seg id="44">There are cases 13.435 accumulated (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).</seg>

<seg id="1">after the Court of Appeal, the United States has confirmed a verdict that the restructuring of the liabilities of the bankrupt group vitro does not recognise, on a trade in Mexico has been achieved, a sinister precedent for each national companies with offices in the neighbouring country, the payment problems.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">So you could say that the procedure for the survival of the companies, the Mexican laws allow, in the land of the stars and stripes in contradiction of international agreements have no validity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In practice, on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale at the court to ban car rotas for the Northern District of Texas, the Mexican companies are exposed to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico and opens the door to three inconsistencies the Supreme Court of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">While the judges issue indicates that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States says the appeal of the fifth circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all, that it is dealt with in the main proceedings of the Mexico trade bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The first point would mean that the international cooperation in the procedure in the event of the insolvency of companies with trans-national profile is not known.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">To this end, was indeed the model law for the unification of the international trade law, the United Nations and the American law institute was used as arbitrators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly, the judgment that, without the votes of societies for the recognition of liabilities in the liquidation of the branches of vitro with their parent company had not achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, this option is recognised by the Mexican laws.</seg>
<seg id="10">Indeed, vitro is not the first case in which this system has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the group by the Instituto federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for trade bankruptcies) confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It is also true that after deducting the votes of the branches of the creditors of vitro, the creditors in the courts of the United States against vitro-cases, i.e. the vulture funds, such as, for example, Aurel ios capital, Aurel ios convergencia, Elliot internacional and Liverpool have limited, no majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The vote would be 45 percent against 37 per cent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, there are other vitro blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the serious economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country strikes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For this reason, the Sada family GonzáLez before the same court objection to the vote in plenary, in other words by all judges voted, because only three of them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">is not met, the Cerciorare-lodged, calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The most serious in this case is that the court a document aside, the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) was sent, what the in vitro procedures carried out within the framework of the law on trade described bankruptcies, and pointed out that it had kept to the letter of the agreement signed by the two countries, in order to comply with the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It also pointed out that the country subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which is to say, it has laid down the rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">BayamóN heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The most emotional memories are those in his time in the vaqueros of the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated with his 15-year anniversary as Chief Executive Officer and Director of the club.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"These were my best years, which I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships since 1967 of the vaqueros as directors, managers or coaches.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">and then I with a championship in 1981, the year of DebüTs of Jerome MINCY BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From then took "cuco" Ortiz, was a very good manager, "says Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I know that gene Bartow, worked here as a coach, and the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players.</seg>

<seg id="20">The championship was the vaqueros with Gausse granted him, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="21">This time, he drew his application and MINCY to enjoy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember when we won for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we should have been the fourth documented what bronze would have been, if not this Canadian referee, we repeated the last Spielzug for the second time, Reyes said.</seg>

<seg id="24">This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best team you have ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is one of the best, as well as those who won in the Olympic Games in 2004 against the dream team.</seg>
<seg id="26">But my favorite is the team at the Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold in 1991 and the team the United States offered a fight, as when they won bronze at the World Cup against us.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the team were not only MINCY Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico LóPez and "PiculíN (Ortiz) (Javier) again, but also the young players' ToñIto 'ColóN and James Carter, LeóN (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario Brothers' Quixote 'morales, the 1990 could not be due to a knee injury.</seg>

<seg id="28">The team, which was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but won a gold medal and the US with great pleasure, those of the Olympic tournament was NeuquéN, Argentina in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="29">with players such as "Canito" nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blockage of players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we oppose any forecast won the gold medal.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This was, without doubt, PiculíN Ortiz.</seg>
