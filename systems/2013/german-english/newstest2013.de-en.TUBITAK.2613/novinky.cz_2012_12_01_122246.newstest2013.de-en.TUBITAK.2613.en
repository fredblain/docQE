Guidelines for inflating of balloons, bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the oddest of bank charges proclaims this year decided that the competition "most absurd regulation or idea from the EU-Werkstatt".
"This idea has brought us the recently by the EU's plan, a 40% quota of introducing in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organisation of the poll, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is located, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
In the meantime, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are for the insurance companies objectively a lower risk.
"The more incredible Bagaudae EU-Werkstatt can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "America» Nacher.
On the controversial regulations include, among other things, the mandatory use of bioethanol for fuel, which in its natural consequence is harmful to the banning of reliable mercury thermometer, just because this is a relatively small amount of this hazardous material, or even the directive to the size of chicken cages, due this year eggs were much more expensive.
Got criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "Butteraufstrich" or even a ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more member countries are represented in the Czech Republic is currently trying (for example, also with veto threat to the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas from the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not "heard abnormality" are allowed.
The European Commission, defended on the grounds that they are only the mixed harmonisiere national standards, which would hinder trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables from the EU against the resistance of some countries have already weakened by pointing out that the existing directives to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons sales must be accompanied by pointing out that children under eight years of the balloon bursts without the supervision of an adult.
The EU, citing an American study in accordance with balloons in the leading cause of death by suffocation of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious Bagaudae at home
Fairly absurd is also a directive, which European officials themselves - everyone in the EU is an official function, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece not to use the name Macedonia and must instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU, so that the maximum volume of food stocks, which is on the day of our membership in the area of the Czech Republic are allowed.
The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the set volume for canned mushroom, and a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or from the idea of funding for requests for aid.
These ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage by that we have no sea.
We will apply for a refund in the EU, "said in the autumn of 2004, the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument, he said that the grain harvest was very high and the government camp as a result of the so-called intervention at the purchases were overcrowded.
Since the Czech Republic have another way to sea ports, the EU should take heart, according to hundreds of millions of euros to pay us.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far, that they are an invitation to tender for the purchase of grain organised from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grants for applications for grants offered the communities, the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically, it has to be the means for the establishment of monetary claims to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the member countries will easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also for efficiency and development of the whole European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition.
A more serious problem, these experts believe that the EU grant money for projects, which have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration have in common, but in the budget negotiations were forced by individual member States.
Emotions in this country is the fact that the Czech Republic, similar to other member States in Brussels about the right to use specific names of traditional products and have to fight this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský несмотря), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, but our manufacturers in "Tuzemák" rename.
The name of rum may only for products made from sugar cane are dangerous, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU in the society of the world-famous Gorgonzola and feta cheese, cold or Lübeck-based of Parma and now the Karlsbad to carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or even the Saazer hops.
With a EU-Marke can because the Pardubicer gingerbread or boasting Hořicer roles.
