In the last few days, there was in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Berlin, Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether they will soon be back to the air.
The protests are led by trade unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests that aim to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States sales, which attract millions of customers, which sometimes led to receive more common.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and his mother, along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which is targeted at low and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products of diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to the elevators, eggs and milk.
The commodity in the Walmart branches is on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Buying so many of the minor paid Walmart workers only on their own work.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, the goods often Walmart can only sell so cheaply, because the workers are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or handheld scanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases, and they expressed their anger at the fact that the contribution to the operating their own health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month was increased.
A typical Walmart employees, who earned $9.5 per hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, show that, if the company, the average wage to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
There are approximately 1.1% more than they now pay.
Walmart wage increases would be entirely up to the customers, each purchase will only 46 cents more.
Per year would be for them today compared to spending of only 12,39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine States to protests, and that the company did no losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period of Walmart sold roughly 5,000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart funds on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees work laid down and the protest only "another PR stunt" of the union, which organised the protests, has been.
"Free 1TOPSTORE!"
The protests were this week in New York, where their goal but not Walmart branches (in this progressive city of unwanted and therefore are not available yet), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billion portions, and yet you were given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.

At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation at $7.25 per hour.
At fast food restaurants will gradually increase the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible, in New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's, behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone was seen as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's always people who complain that they live with this reward and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is in the forum of the newspaper, The Wall Street Journal a comment, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the FIFA Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants, a minimum wage of $15 per hour, with more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
You also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits the corporate governance, the goal to stand in the way of trade union members and abzumahnen or redundant.
On the other hand, the corporate governance is not easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Discontented
Vocal protests on this day, there were also many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The height of the protests was a meeting at midday in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it should sell billion portions, and yet you were given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should all support the fast-food workers so that they receive a fair wage and economic prosperity can be achieved, every New York deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the ground, which is far from everyone in the fast-food industry, in the tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise all masses.
