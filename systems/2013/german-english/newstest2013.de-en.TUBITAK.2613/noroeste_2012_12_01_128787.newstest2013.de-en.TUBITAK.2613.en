After the Court of Appeal judgment of the United States has confirmed that the restructuring of the liabilities of the group of vitro, which has a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, will be a more sinister precedent for each national companies with operations in the neighbouring country, the payment problems.
You could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies, which the Mexican laws allow, in the land of the Stars and Stripes is contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judges at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale for the Northern District of Texas on the Mexican company the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless.
However, the decision to open the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to open the floodgates to three inconsistencies because the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge the matter indicates that the creditors in the bankruptcy law in the United States must be subject to the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all, that the main proceedings in Mexico's trade to the bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in case of default by companies with trans-national profile is not known.
Indeed, to this end, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, but the American Law Institute has been used as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the societies in recognition of the liabilities in the estate of the branches of vitro with its parent company, not the majority needed for the restructuring of the debt would have been reached.
But this is the possibility of the Mexican laws.
Indeed, vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade bankruptcies) confirmed.
It is also true that, after deducting the voices of the branches of the creditors of vitro, the creditors in the courts of the United States against vitro complained, in other words, the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, no majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there are vitro blame for its difficult situation from 2008 as part of the major economic crisis in the United States, which hits the country.
For this reason, the family Gonzalez Sada before the same court of appeal contradiction to the vote in the House, that is, all the judges, because only three of them were voting on.
It is not, will the Cerciorare-Einspruch, the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious in this case is that the court has set aside a document by the government of Mexico under the amicus curiae figura (friend of the court) has been sent to the vitro procedure carried out within the framework of the law on trading bankruptcies, and pointed out that it strictly abide by the agreements signed by the two countries had kept the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law to comply with the United States.
It also pointed out that the country is the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade has, in other words, the established rules for cross-border insolvency, the equality between debtors and creditors.
