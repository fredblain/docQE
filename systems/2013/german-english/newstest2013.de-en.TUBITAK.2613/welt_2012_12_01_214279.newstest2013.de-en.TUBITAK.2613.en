The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution of Sharia law as the basis is hotly disputed.
The Egyptian President Division with emotion.
We need to create the transition.
"And that he will succeed is my responsibility to the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to all the people, but above all, to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because all of them, has been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile of Grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed his powers and extended, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-jährige engineer, who holds a PhD from the University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles that dominated by the Islamist 100-person constitutional assembly as a late-night, 15-stündigen Parforceritt were pushed through, in part, worrying.
As in previous constitutions also says in the draft, the legal grounds on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles"?
It was, and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists legally-vague wording and the attendant legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
It has conducted at least one new article: Sharia law in all of these matters should consult with al-Azhar, the main Islamic institution in the country, with great clout in the whole of Sunni Islam.
It does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which is the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
The Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be preserved.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule to the repression of opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The state should also, as stated in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect and promote its morals and values."
It is legally so vague, that state institutions, with the help of this article, even the contents of cinema and literature could control.
In plain English, this means nothing more than censorship.
There is no article, writes the equality of men and women.
Bans for another, the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to offend or slander.
But what an insult is and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the wording of the "insult to the people" should be banned.
There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a Leader?
Open to interpretation, as so much in the draft, Morsi to sign before and after his words "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unaccustomed concord on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed that the Charter, even before they can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution belong "on the scrapheap of history."
Via messaging service Twitter, he accused the supporters of Morsi, a "coup against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," quoted the Egyptian media, the opposition politician Khaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum does not want to monitor, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution.
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves on the demonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer at the other Bank before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, attended and cried: "The people calling for the application of God's law."
You demanded by Morsi: "A cleanse the country!" And extremely: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would have faced a similar situation led to civil war.
The wanted Morsi ’ s supporters clearly not at risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft EU constitution, as well as the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time, the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamists is regarded as safe.
"The word "human rights is not even before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which until February was gone and involve all social forces.
The 48-jährige human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were in prison or under Mubarak in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible.
For that, he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the word is human rights, not even in the new constitution," he said in the interview with the "world on Sunday."
Morsi power expansion in all three branches of the State's lawyer did not give up.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will be a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Rather than to strengthen civil society, the president they have de facto repeal" Saeda complained.
But without civil society organisations could a democracy does not work.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community that the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
A protestor in the Tahrir warns: "Your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."
