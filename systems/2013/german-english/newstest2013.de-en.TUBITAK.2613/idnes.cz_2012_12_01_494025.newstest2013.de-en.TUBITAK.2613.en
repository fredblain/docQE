Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a member of this most megacultural Space Agency, Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008 ESA-Mitglied).
Poland began in 1994, close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA-Projekten.
The path of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish space enthusiasts with the space, but they have not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, the talk of A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought from his pioneering work "entrance to the cosmopolitan nautik".
The ideas of the young engineer, born in 1905), the audience, however, cold, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the cosmopolitan nautik" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch REP-Hirsch donated Prix.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognised contribution to the development of space has been acknowledged by, among other things, that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Was already in 1925 in Poland a Eisenbahn-Draisine built for a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the rocket to start or the brakes of the Draisine should be used.
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry, with rocket kommende bullets.
The research, the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the traditional documents is clear that the research into the stage of practical tests,.
The research was then, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, appeared in the press of ing. Rohoziński, draft photo electric hunting vehicle, and the following year, the plant "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" Leliwa-Krzywoblocky of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket engine.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology from the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, but his work has been completed by the beginning of the war.
Another article on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society will take place in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major items of space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company.
At the time, there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future of space exploration.
At its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA to join to the 1951 founded International Federation for space, and in fact, the PTA member already in the autumn of 1956.
The following year was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902, 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
Office he had, until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA was instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on 10 October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1,800 metres was approximately 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959 and began in the Bledowska Desert flight tests of the two-stage missile RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be in a position to provide real scientific work, the rocket RM-34 should an altitude of up to 14.5 km and the monitoring of high end.
In 1962, however, the further development.
Successor to the first missiles of the type of RM, in the years from 1962 to 1965 entwickelte Meteor-1-Rakete.
The rocket was a two-stage missile designed, its total length, 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
This rocket were three sublcasses entwickelt (Meteor-1A, 1B and 1c States), which is different in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C about 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude fraud in all three types of 37 km.
In the years from 1965 to 1968, the aviation institute the Meteor-2-Rakete entwickelt, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was capable of a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km.
After that, the versions and Meteor-2H Meteor-3.
It is also noteworthy for the accession of Poland to the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, two years later, the creation of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed.
Poland participated in the context of the interactive space programme in the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second unangenehmen kosmonaut.
