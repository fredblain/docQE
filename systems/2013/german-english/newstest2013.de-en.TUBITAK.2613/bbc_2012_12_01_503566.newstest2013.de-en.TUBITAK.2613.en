Rakfisk from Norway: is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
The secret of the success of the country could have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection to mature cheeses.
You place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, more humid sports clothing.
And they leave that for a week.
About one needs the nose numb smell of Rakfisk vorstellen, one of the great delights of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes, and this persistent smell in the air, which simply will not go away.
Rakfisk is with salt best repented trout, which, depending on how you would like fish stink - up to a year in water ferments.
In Norway, the darkness of the country and the weather is colder, flows Norwegians to a celebration here in Fagernes, that, well, really very bestechenden speciality.
"You eat it raw and Grixis it down with a glass of aquavit," says Halvarsen Coal Miner, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General" the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cube and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Like the aquavit Mansche people more than the Rakfisk" Coal Miner says.
The spirit can the smell.
I eat some hors d'oeuvres.
If it avoids Rakfisk in the nose, he is not bad, such as sushi, which is quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration facilities and fish in the autumn in air thick salt water barrels was watered.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and, no doubt with the help of alcohol consumed, steamed senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country, mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not so long ago was far richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strictly (part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, you can buy here.
But in fact is all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people, this does not seem to upset.
Here still hates it, Anders Breivik, to name those racist right-wing extremists, who last year 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians are so difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country to such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with seasoned Rakfisk distributed and with her long blond hair and blue eyes stabbing the Nordic ideal.
We are, as they say, sensible people.
Her English is exactly like that of most people here spotless.
We are not very angebe#, we may not ostentation.
Norway is very cautious in dealing with its oil wealth, a large part of the industry earnings will be for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, all the money is raised, that they had not, Norway his wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk eat", it deals with light-hearted laughter.
I am standing in the snow and put me on another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk) is definitely something else. The succulent meat told me.
But in the evening, the two fish on the menu.
The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several locations to organise a Rakfisk-Dinner where guests for the best - or, perhaps, the smell of the most challenging - fish can vote.
There is a fly with a Live-TV-Schaltung "show, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor# jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Coal Miner's Daughter".
We note and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But it is perhaps the strict mist of the whole fish.
