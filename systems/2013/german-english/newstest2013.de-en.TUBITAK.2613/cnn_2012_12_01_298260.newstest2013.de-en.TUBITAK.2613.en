"My American identity crisis.
Many people because of the lack of opportunities were forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to emigrants to accuse - they call them in hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control when confusion in me wide.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "1989" ("Mexicans"), another for "For" ("foreigners").
I stood there, a few seconds, uncertain, to which I have to go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up and all my life, "Mexicans."
An ethnic acronym - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I opted for "Whig amerikanisch".
But it was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's, there was no need for acronyms or dashes.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to me in this language on both ends of the interviews.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for.
I thought about the moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues that is expected when the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Sugeria Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today as likely to remain in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States.
He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and a North American trading bloc after the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed that the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even though he gave no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans have probably never waste a single idea that the United States in 1848 in Mexico, causing the leadership of the country under the golden gun to budget has forced more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event.
Therefore, once a US officer only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country, complaints about how the Americans afflict the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of zumas go on the war path.
And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
To talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the land of opportunity, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at one point a person in our family tree, perhaps a parent or large parent - was given no chance in Mexico and north immigrated.
And in most cases, this person was a profile, dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.
Perhaps our identity is sometimes blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class may not.
This is based on reciprocity.
You can see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
The Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
Their view, is our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, they would not.
And then we would not now trapped behind the silk curtain, with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and as a child legally in the United States had slipped, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions exist because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them so badly.
While American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, who I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los griegas del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I learned during my trip, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora.
You want to Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Is now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid that you alone, Amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico to one and a half centuries, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members, just not so long ago.
After.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.
