In all the world as it is beautiful, also to be bored
Unexpectedly, this Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport when the plane was due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not want to lie.
Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts führen boredom as something positive.
If it were up to them, it is for us, and our children - OK, sometimes to be bored.
This is the brain in interesting thoughts to lose, and possibly the creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly on one or other screen rigid, brings us the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should the boredom so welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
To I come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "I: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), it is not the case.
"In fact, the boredom of a very long history," he says.
The house walls fossils has a Latin graffiti on boredom, which in the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define actually boredom.
John D. Eastwood's, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood's and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, "a satisfactory job, but this is not to" define.
Boredom is different from apathy, therefore, that the person is not considered, but would like to be.
The apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
Boredom can listen to almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood's believes that although these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that we are boring, even if we only have trouble us.
In their study "The if O'Rourke Mind: defining I in Terms of Attention" - German, for example: "The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention", which in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" appeared, Professor Eastwood's and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listen to a band, in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, which has nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group these sounds are not heard.
Those who are barely recognisable television heard in more boring than the other two groups, they have had problems, too, could find no reason for it and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, a dreary work performed, "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, can distract music and help, not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can fight even by people who are physically more closely.
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln, learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually boring - my late flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly ermüdender movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s, a "scale to Lange Review26 vulnerability."
On the scale are statements such as "Many things I have to do to repeat themselves and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I did not have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers found that boys and girls will be more boring, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - particularly on the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers with quite a lot more interesting.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contact.
He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and the homework you were bored, whereas 23%, to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom, increase or decrease.
He was sure, however, that "the youth is seen as the most boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily routines.
So back to my original question: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people are extreme physical risks and gambling or drugs, in order to alleviate them, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers to examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, the issue for more than two decades.
"With the boredom is the brain of a saying that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what you should do it best.
If one is dull and the energy used to play guitar and cooking, will be happy.
But television may make sense for good in the short term, these verflüchtigen but in the long term.
If his bored child an iPad, so that it can be diverted from boredom. It is not, however, learned to themselves or to maintain control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-regulation is conveyed from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to maintain, but gains in other areas more self-control.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not to be critical.
Instead, our aim should be to us away from the constant Aktivitäts wohlzufühlen berieselung and technology.
Professor Eastwood's agrees.
"It sounds more often than we would have to be boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people in truth only, look for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly to be stimulated, it is hard to deal with, even if the noise is silent."
