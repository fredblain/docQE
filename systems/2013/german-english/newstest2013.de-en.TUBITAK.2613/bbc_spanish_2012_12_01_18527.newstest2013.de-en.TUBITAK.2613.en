Singapore needs babies to save the economy.
The SWF ’ s, Singapore ’ s blame to ensure that they do not have children, to the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children.
"The people of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper# songs, the local slogans such as "it will be a" Perhaps "(loaf) in the oven, the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun of.
The advertising agency BBH, which the video was filmed, is the hope that the advert on funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of music to the people to make their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The breed, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of Speed optimization evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as to compose a Rap?
1.2 children,
If this issue is not easy, is the government of Singapore.
Every year, they are $1,300 for policies to encourage the public to have more children.
A package of government grants for couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, highly technological city state in south-east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the SWF ’ s, Singapore ’ s more children?
Tang Wei Ming, Director for marriage and family policies of the national population authority, says that this is a "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This is the people, except to marry and have a family to make a lot more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social realities have the higher number of people living alone and the delay of the marriage and births, the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy has led to a sharp increase in the more targets for the reduction of the population, to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the few generations xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, the criticism that they maintain low wages and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections was an attempt to solve the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Of unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the cost of health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore also unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are being built.
It has also had an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun, the number of small apartments to check the "shoe boxes" are known and in certain areas of the city should be built.
These apartments have a residential area of 46 square metres and show a huge sales success.
However, there is concern that the lifestyle of the people living alone can promote, and that they discourage the construction of large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company el Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" much faster than larger units sell.
You are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger units.
This means that they are for our cash flow are much better.
It is, however, that the new standards developers clearer guidelines, which previously put obstacles in the way, if they have too many small residential units in a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules of the road to a rise in the national birth rate could cause is the talks with the Singapurern, working in the financial district, says that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, so it will be delayed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me, on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.
Men and women in their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that they have no children.
That is why the SWF ’ s, Singapore ’ s the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much.
