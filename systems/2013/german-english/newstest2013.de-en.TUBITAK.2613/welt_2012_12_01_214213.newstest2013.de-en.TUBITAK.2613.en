A trace search in the country where 97-Jährige is still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch-Gebirge is wild, romantic.
The van caught by surprise on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and lush, one might think that it would in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few miles away.
Here, the chū-hai People's group of taly adds that not much is known, except that they are perfectly Farsi and aser# talks and very durable.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small town of flaunts wuchtig to pick from Soviet times, so do not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists come from Europe Barely here is too onerous for the Azerbaijani capital Baku.
For the 323 miles you need eight hours, because the street is professional.
The fabulous wealth of the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is here in the province has not yet arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the stuff to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the eurovision song festival famous - and in the next year, we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen taly adds Babbolone enviremont documented the older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years ago a child conceived
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, 168 years old.
A birth certificate, however, there is not.
And given the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.
"She was born here in the region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva explained.
The man had been married three times and have 23 children, at the age of 136 years he is still a daughter testified.
Has Şirali Müslümov at his age, charged for a couple of decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Striking many hochaltrige people is also available in some parts of China, Japan or the hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia live very many very old men."
However, due to a lack of documentation is no scientific proof of age, especially civil register lacked.
Every day, molten butter cup
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik striking a biblis# often with age.
Currently, there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why live here in the south so many high elderly?
The Azeri travel guide Mugimzadeh Farid said that with the particular genes of taly adds.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
But that it should be the calorie rich diet of taly adds, is to be as healthy meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them on a daily basis, drink a glass of molten butter, from a nutritional point of view is not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is for this region is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, claiming that 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
You are sitting on the ground with a butter keg they tirelessly herrollt back and forth.
Eight people live under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen to prepare the tea in the typical, belly punctiform Armadu-Gläsern.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and link under her headscarf conceals her long, dark blonde braids, her son proudly in front of us.
I have my hair with milk, so they went out and I never kept their color.
"I have never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to
She has always eaten only by their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I have not once in the supermarket to buy food.
Then she told of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult of the father figure of the nation, his country as a dictator who ruled that knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan elderly.
230 Al-Lat (about the same amount in euros), receives a monthly pension Mirzayeva, here, a sum that we can live well.
And perhaps even Mirzayevas long on things son right: "The elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
You live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive
