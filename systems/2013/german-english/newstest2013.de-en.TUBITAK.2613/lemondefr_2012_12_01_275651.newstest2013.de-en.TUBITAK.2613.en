"Match is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have to match a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
You can through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the match.
Great players are.
Every day I am on their side.
The technical staff has also given a lot to me.
These elements spur me on a daily basis, to improve my level of play.
And in a game, it is even easier.
In football, everything is very quickly.
But I must stop not in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of inf directory Clairefontaine features an up to my playing time in Saint-Etienne, I have always gradual progress.
You have the advantage of Carlo Ancelotti introduced competition...
The new entrants this summer are accustomed to games very high level.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me who have to stand up and give his best.
Carlo Ancelotti, gives me a lot in terms of my game.
He will be supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I am.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the match?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon are the place of the finishers.
But we are in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League, we have in this way, for the quarter finals.
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we are against very good European teams we have something to say about it.
First of all, we want to be first in our group in Porto, so that we have the return match in the event that Celtic can compete as a home game.
Can the match in the short term, a big European club?
He has already the budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris title win and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the match the resources so that this project taking shape.
It would be a great failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to win, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really dear to cream off this title.
In the last season, we were close.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough for the victory.
We have the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be master with 79 points.
But a different team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have got what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the match?
In light of what has been invested and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept that completely.
If, however, we are in a home game against Troyes midfielder win, and it still is something you can accuse us of, this is certainly a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win every weekend with midfielder.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, fails to qualify for the quarter finals, and also has made huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed to break with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who last season were not good, this new match "geboostet".
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we in the month of May will be smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The match seems entirely by the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that of a "Zlatan-Abh√§ngigkeit".
This means that Pellegrini is really powerful and many goals.
That is why he has come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respected the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows all the others to make progress.
As you have the Euro 2012 with the French national team experience?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented some game time.
I have seen things there, which I am stronger.
Today, I am, good games in the national team.
Since this was my baptism with the Bleus my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learnt our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strictly, is close to the players and to victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to no comparison.
Blanc had achieved its goal, he had qualified for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps Bleus will lead to Brazil.
It is on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1:1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never been a similar game in my career.
