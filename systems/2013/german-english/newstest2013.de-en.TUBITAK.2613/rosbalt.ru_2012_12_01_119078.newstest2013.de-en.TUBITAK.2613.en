Own taste rather than culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt, the project "Petersburg avant-garde", the city dwellers is devoted to the avant-garde of the art and culture.
On the elite list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes on the borders of the city and often go beyond recognition in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be known.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded dressed in red, sometimes at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden, or take in the scene Musical-Instruments.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also are issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also a man of the city and firework through its presence on the streets of his fellow citizens in the face and a smile at them for good humour.
Recently, he grabbed a revolving organ and became the Petersburg Dominion-occupied organ player, as it is for this difficult role in terms of his artistic role, his philosophy and his image was finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city.
I have the color red as a fashion designer, who is with the optics and the image.
In this world is red the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In the society calls on everything differs somewhat from the grey standard, aggression and bad behaviour.
But let me through my provocations with the people into the conversation.
Any of my past provocations was an invitation to the meeting.
- When Did you know that you have to be painter?
- In one of the main exhibition in the Palace of Culture, in my work were issued.
I realised that I need to go this way.
It was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter had ended, and new and free painters as I was incomprehensible.
I am friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; hence, "" Pushkinskaya "10", and it was only once.
It brings me to the theater, fashion, music, really everything, except the literature.
- And all the united in your art clinic... It was important to me, in the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the "Pushkinskaya" 10, and there was up to the renovation of a musically artistic club for the renaissance, the house of the Petersburg renaissance.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
String and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wearing tight T-shirts and one of them was the composer Igor Wdowin Berlin-Fiedrichshain said today.
When the group began to play live, was removed from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the foundations he learned with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art clinic.
There, our employees and passengers.
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture meant something.
In 2000 there was a poll in the press when it comes to the award "personalities of our city".
I won in the category of "artist of the year", and that I was at the peak.
It is not easy, in new times under old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without a cultural contribution.
- your work have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring the timeliness and accuracy of the idea.
I will be an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was socially, but now it pains and fear, to be the case.
All in a clown blurred and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
For example, we save the world, we require that everyone has to complete.
Now each on the clothes and is modelled on the exterior and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps we should not be a man's hand, but he should spit in the face.
The deception disappears through the disguised.
Recently, we saw in the role of urban spin organ player. - A Culture should be as a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can also commercial art be beautiful?
- It must be commercial art cautious, respectful and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Previously the large groups of people: the travellers loved one thing and the ordinary people of the other.
Now there are microbial communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not one hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you see whom thou shalt have fallen.
Now, every cult star around 100 supporters.
- On the appearances of Michailow but that several thousand.
- To him gathereth women, in the social sphere sexuell# plays a role.
For cultural reasons are 300 people, and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and anything goes.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I have such pictures painted by a collector, even in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with images, which normally only at the end of their careers.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, this is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and rejected money in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- the best cultural experts.
They say: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Mussourgsky it was different, because the Mussourgsky may not have seen a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
What we have in St. Petersburg, the experts could be, but they will be barred because it requires more senior experts, the former properly evaluate and pave the way for them.
Now only one of their own taste.
The same is true for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters have to look for other museums.
Petersburg - What is for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones can art is difficult to grow up.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
Us, these are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
