Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is possibly up to 20 metres thick.
The US-Raumfahrtbehörde NASA, the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are some frozen water, as three on Thursday in the specialist journal "Science" published studies.
The probe Messenger have found evidence that it constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet, the ice sheet.
This is at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids may also on the Mercury are taken.
No one put the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix, in the depths of space.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small elbow holes in endless expanses.
The image comes from a camera, the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute have developed.

One of the biggest and strongest pictures of the Hubble telescope: the whirlpool galaxy
According to the colours are pictures of spiral galaxies to true works of art.
The European Southern Haller veröffentlichte picture shows the several thousand light-years away in the constellation Trifid-Nebel TR-116.

Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope will warm by Hans Lipperhey invented before Galileo Galilei - be it a year later to observation.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes ever larger - and the insight they provide, ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the hale telescope in palomar# Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It can look into space just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of the Gran telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - alone the mélong to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres.
The detriment of cheap design: the telescope is at its height, ground to a halt, and limited in his movement.
The Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas is in the high angle.
His characteristic: the high light gathering power.
This is despite comparatively low mirror diameter - the mirror of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers the space for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Search for extra specification and the LG Intelligence (SETI) each computer owners can help by computing power available.
The Observatory of the European medical facility in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors the telescope, the medium-sized infrared spectrum ausleuchten.
Also on the Chilean ESO-Observatorium will the European Extremely Large Telescope.
Its main mirror is LetsGoMobile 42 meters include - and from nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
With images, however, is likely until at least 2018.
By 2007, the two had escaped from telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea fettran as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten metres.
The telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-Observatoriums escaped, among them with the subaru# telescope and the IRTTF looks at the sky.
Also on the summit of Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope with a mirror, settlements from 30 metres.
Here it is on an illustration.
The main impressions from the space, however, the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it already images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope to IV "- especially for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 was captured by the announced that Ciechocinek planetary candidates since the beginning of the mission have been identified.
In the picture are the last launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) until at least 2018 aboard a Ariane5-Rakete shot into space.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: in light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that the South Pole of the Mercury ice exists.
However, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger far closer to the North Pole to the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades, suggest that there is ice on the Mercury.
Launched in 2004 by the Messenger probe - the first, which revolves around the Mercury, the scientists have now a certainty.
