Petronella Wyatt: i was mobbed from Oxford, because I am Tory
Not only university students of today will be attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream, a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university, which I once for the largest knowledge temple in the world, for a modern Greek symposium, which is the major pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College in the late 1980s, there, I had intended to study history, I had my suitcase and so the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said that I would be gone, because I had a problem with that Jesse had sex in the adjoining room.
The author of A N Wilson said schelm#, I would have to leave the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only - a reason in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment so parochial and cruel seemed: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I have been a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, current reportedly suffers from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has assumed such proportions that a group of them last week, the same protection of equality for the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christ College, it will be because of their political views "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable."
You ask for a place in the equality committee of their College, in order to ensure that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent TV documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been shown, among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, a former president of the conservative student association at the University of Oxford, in a Rolls-Royce, and with a silver-tone suit and silver occupied protzte walking stick.
At other universities say conservative students, they are as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student at the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing leftward trend in universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without ever having met."
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christ, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the view that such a climate is "embarrassing." The persons who Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the conservative student association of Oxford says she voted for JCR-Mitgliedern a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of its members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was part of a minority.
As I was unbelievably timid 18-J채hrige in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
Last year, the university voted in favour of Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education to give an honorary title.
The atmosphere would have even wake Stalinists.
In the first days of the week erstsemester#, the new students, and the equivalent of acquaintance, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the equivalent of the mockery of Tory students not only facilities, but also happily attended.
Political issues such as the miners strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa had found their way into the wood panelled rooms of Tutoriums.
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century, translated into English. On what should come, I have not been taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (live), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face as a gate, and how much.
"Refuse Thatcher fans, French to learn, or are they simply stupid?" He asked me.
The other students kicherten.
To see tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you in your free time between a couple of hours, so if you are not too much with your social activities are employed," growled to Pitt.
I returned to my room with h채ngendem head in.
On this evening, I sat in the College alone at dinner, when someone easily typed on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who is a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is being harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most of the Tory incoming claim, supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried later to me.
I insisted that I do not at all points of view with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A young student in philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, the conservative current Eton College, said to me: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig ".
You polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How did Tories sex?" Asked me one.
The beat each other?
I felt like homosexuals from the more liberal legislation in the United States have had to have felt.
I would ever be able, at Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would like-minded only after dark can take?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclination to suppress?
The three years before me, in my mind is extended to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only one who openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which has its headquarters in my college.
It was not only hated, a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in matters of foreign policy advice and wrote speeches for them.
He was only rarely.
He hated the place found him provincial and small-minded and turned him down for his Marxist-Leninist deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997, he was a visiting professor at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"Thou shalt not be happy here," he said to me.
I began between Oxford and the house of my parents to move and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated, Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed disbelief.
During his time in the four Luxor were all political views.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
Something they would never do, not in my city of Pakistan spires.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners on the day.
His wet eyes marred.
Enter the whole a chance.
I am sure that you only get teased.
It would break my heart, if you go.
Exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had bowed to pressure to renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums the following week, in which another history tutor seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I've decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I am my parents a "brainwashing" had been subjected to, and called it "old stupid."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my H채scher.
As they went, I grabbed a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Like you can call me a wine EU-Seychelles schlapp# series.
But no 18-J채hrige should ever in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice.
And even more tragic is that there was a University of Oxford, who not only 14 Tory, but up to now behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
