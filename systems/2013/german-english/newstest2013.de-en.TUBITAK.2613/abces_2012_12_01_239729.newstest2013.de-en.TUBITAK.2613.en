"Valentino has elegance of the celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of Couture," which opened this week in London, speaks with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani is worthy.
This, the designers at the opening of "Valentino: master of Couture" acknowledged, a grandiose retrospective, for which more than 130 of the haute couture clothes were put together by his "Maison" in the last 50 years have been created.
"I love this palace," he says, with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist "il signore" Garavani, but without his distinguierte clientele would be written.
Valentino had always had a fascination for the sensational and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which has until March 3 to see, there is a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the choicest aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from modest fashion in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of international Jetsets.
To be in love with the nobility, must not be at a disadvantage.
"At least they are not overturned on your beautiful carpet, as some do beautiful celebrities from the pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps, and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, more generous and elegant host.
"We all saw us, if we were invited to his home in Gstaad," said the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always been the elegance of the celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
