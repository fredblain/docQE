The Higgs particle boson analysed
The announcement of the probable discovery of Higgs-Bosons last summer, has a certain sensation, and for good reason.
It does, in fact, that this Boson to nothing less than the mechanism is involved in the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And, finally, is the last particle whose existence from the standard model, our best or least wrong explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but still not empirically observed.
But for the physicist, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the Higgs particle predicted by the Standard Model boson strong.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data this week on a major physics conference in Kyoto were presented, but there are still no data, to be completely safe.
We are still working on the assumption that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk to deceive, and we are looking at what is at stake.
There are in this world will inevitably be inescapable law, which means that two objects not in the same place at the same time, there can be.
It is not possible to go against this rule, and try not to, because you are hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they, too, such a law, "the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles do not have the same space occupied at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state", the "state" by and large, from some of their properties.
On this basis, the particle physicists share in two categories.
In one corner are good citizens, who are referred to as Fermione and suddenly the rotational poles.
And in the other move all, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that they are, in fact, at the same time, in the same place.
These all are made according to the website The delta Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Greek barys, meaning "we will not deal with the "power particles," by which the great forces of nature and spread the Higgs particle boson somehow would be used.
It must be emphasised, however, that not all of these all such exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this history, it was only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the Q-switching or the "light particles," the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electrical charge is accelerating or change the direction, the electromagnetic field exactly in this place "disrupted", such as a pebble in a pond was thrown.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the all "winner of the force."
More stable field
The same is true for the Higgs particle boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs particle field, "disrupted" must be to ensure that this Boson shows.
However, the Higgs particle field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has very high energy, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks could be addition.
This is a huge particle accelerator as CERN needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a total of 27 km - in order to achieve this kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again, the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all of the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, a piece of paper would never even in the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs particle field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the Q-switching) have no mass.
For what can all these research now "good" asked Mrs Plamondon?
For the science they serve the revision of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all deviations between the observations and predictions of SM to investigate.
There are also many physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference a door to a "new physics" and open some holes of the model could fill.
It must be said that the latter has serious shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which account for around 80% of the subject matter of the universe (retabling ups!).
However, the CERN such deviations until now not been found.
Effects of
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the laboratories was not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
You saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the film itself, the first permanent TBarCode laser (were the first continuous) has already said that the laser at the beginning rather than a "laboratory she" has been seen.
Imagine....
In addition, applications from all the instruments, the research.
For example, has, in turn, Willard Boyle 1969 during his work on a small light sensor.
Although it is not the original purpose was to serve this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and gave him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you can never really know.
