Ministry of the Interior ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons to offences extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the arms law for private gun owners.
The authorities in order to respond to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven people have died in the killing spree of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police do not carry lethal weapons ban in the public and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years later.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes to the Arms Act will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities to the problems with "attraction of the screws".
On the Internet has published an open letter, the author, representatives of various armed groups, demand that the authorities of "senseless tightened up".
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 Verbrechen with application of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period, a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, in Moscow every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stressed that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons through several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.

The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons during the fighting in the Caucasus have been stolen.
"The weapons were both from the Russian officers and the stolen Kaukasiern itself," says Baranez.
On the second channel are illegal weapons, the custodians are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that these weapons are both from the arms of the police, as well as directly from employees of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.
Further illegally selling weapons come from military arsenals.
In many military camps, there was often explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases of arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Make a contribution to the black market, according to Baranez the arms manufacturers.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories, the international competition and therefore do not stand under the hand of the weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow, wasted," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia, organized the smuggling," explained the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated how much of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market in illegal weapons around.
In 2011, a report by the Center for analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Service for late16th statistics, forensic literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the issue of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are going through the "guilt of leaders in their work has to do with weapons," the report States.
According to the data, the researchers are 17% of the weapons from conflict zones, 14% of thefts in arms production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A technician in a weapons shop, who did not want to be named, assured that weapons, which are found in illegal excavations, for a long time, no one is buying, because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more likely that traders are the supply in a weapons cache.
A Ensign is a weapon, a pistol, for example, the TT, bought.
The weapon will be issued and through the fence.
"The traders, the weapon in the city and sold them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know about everything, of course, and, therefore, if the plan for the detection of crimes cannot fulfil periodically tracking purchases in stores that offer illegal weapons," the technician.
"As the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find most on friends to each other.
I had seen my Web sites and blogs, as someone who has been out on me and I suggested to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me that would like to have some place where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon was there, I learned
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to obtain a weapon, I need a friend, the contacts," says the technician. "I have a friend, but I trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and have a code "of Ivan Iwanowitsch, the direction that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am now even some key rings with a friend, whom I trust.
It gives me the key rings also only because he knows that I not verpfeife.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways.
The former military personnel, Viktor Baranez tried in the mid 1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject.
The scheme, according to him, have not changed.
He got a photo album, in which "everything".
"I felt like the luxury load," remembers the military personnel.
The buyer gets Baranez else not a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
I, as a potential customer buy not just, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we have a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," describes the expert the approach.
