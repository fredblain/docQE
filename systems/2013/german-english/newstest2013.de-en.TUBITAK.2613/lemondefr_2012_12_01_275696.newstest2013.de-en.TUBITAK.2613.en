With Bitcoin is possible without bank payment and selling
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision tangible: the belief that the current banking monopolies and monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, is that of Satoshi Nakasone ’ s (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.), as well as convertible a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network have already been around 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, with a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros), he fell five months later to 2 dollars today before he recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly shine in comparison to the global trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest shown here.
You Bitcoin describes as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to traditional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to make headway in a video game, you win games or buy (and sometimes to share).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed such a system.
But every time the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin network nodes are all at the same time, repositories of the Court, auditors, ATM issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Any transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address, which the anonymity.
A number of associated with this transaction data will electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way can the network the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the entire network of widespread accounting book of public accounts are available.
The crucial step is that this new transaction in this book.
This is happening on a mathematical task, which is run on computers, with the winner, a kind of provisional central bankier that privilege, this additional line to add.
It is a Zerstückeln the file, in other words, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer "are" the new transaction and add a number, before the whole thing "non-straighted".
The goal is to find one number, which is a unique fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this figure was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is permanently with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay, would be only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains without a link, because they have different fingerprints.
The computer, the task has been resolved, gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will reward regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre.
In addition, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, have been attacked and the Bitcoin-Einlagen stolen.
"The weakness is not the real record," says Pierre Noizat just Paymium has introduced a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, they will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from weizmann Institute in Israel and the accounting book analyses showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins not circulating.
In November, a "file final sales".
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," rejoiceth Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul that Bitcoins converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses but Bitcoin for validation of the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holders of its identity and therefore can remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented with the traders, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply need to enter an address by a telephone "photographed and identified", Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend, the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems designed to be rethought.
"It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, by the way, the various risks today as a highly respected in the event of a success to revalue its currency.
