A constitution with a sledgehammer in Egypt
It is a new game of poker President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily the unlimited power, more than ever, remains divided, he has decided to go for broke.
To the surprise of all, he has on Wednesday announced that the Constituent Assembly, the next day will adopt its final version.
Just a week ago, the head of state this House two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt is now for almost two years ago on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and a legal mess.
This new initiative has only for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, remains the President in his "autocratic Delirium," he continues to "his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the side of his supporters assures you that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time, the brothers is forcing us to give up on their projects, the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest has been raging across the country.
According to excess in an interview with the American weekly show Time Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this recourse to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or my memories of the unlimited power", the latter should be after the adoption of the constitution is supposed to end.
85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly, the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals, the request.
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in the middle of November, they have turned away, because they believe that they were not able to enforce their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
To reach the quorum yesterday morning were hurriedly 11 persons, deputy members, added.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that the article mostly were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... in time for the prayer has been expressed, as some members of the committee felt that the 1675 the Constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, all the attention, after all, is identical to that of the 1971 constitution and says that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had hoped that "the principles" by "the rules" to replace a stricter application had been made possible.
For the Islamists is the fact that this has not been changed, proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" reciprocate the Liberals, the only as propaganda strike.
According to them, because the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
They have in mind in particular Article 220 of Al-Azhar University, an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Ã„gypten# spezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people who are being asked to give an opinion, not elected, and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals will also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the university is far less than the current one is likely to be moderate.
"There is currently no specific religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, are not Ulema, but academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, "Alexis appeased Blouet, a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that in relation to the Article 220 an ambiguity can be, because the terms used the religious vocabulary are borrowed.
It is here in particular to the "four" [Islamic jurisprudence, ndr.].
And in the future could be raised the question of to what extent Zivilrichter are competent to decide."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday strongly because of the far-reaching powers, the president of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that this compared with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget is not presented to Parliament, but a national NDC.
Likewise, there will be no ban on civil procedure in military courts, as the human rights organisations have said.
The latter also share their concerns in relation to the text, which they see as freedom bedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, with serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, there is no article relates more to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
Their view, is the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President yesterday evening on television to express, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the Head of State will march Saturday.
