Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
The second long dowel each, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was the wicker sport for more than 60 years and has around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection in the history of the long dowel each of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was killed by a stroke in 2008, confined to a wheelchair, was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, be it as a player of lower classes, the first National League, agent and director BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the World Basketball Association.
"My life, I have many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s was," recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates this statement is not.
The walls of his house, almost all with photos and memories of his long career, decorated and testify.
The heart Bayamón
The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where his 15-year-old anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or directors of the club.
"These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967, be it as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach.
There were many rewarding years, including the five championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN.
From then, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "says Reyes.
I remember that I am Gene Bartow, who has worked as a teacher and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 metres wide players.
If you want to? "
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow recommended then free throw specialists Raymond Gausse, go through naturalisation, and one of our best one.
I remember, as he said that if a championship for Mincy Bayamon, Gausse for another.
The championship of the Vaqueros Gausse was granted to him, but even from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association.
This time, he moved it to its executions and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, when the fourth place, but what should have been, if not the Canadian referee would have been the last game of the second time repeated, said Reyes.
This group of the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who work in the Olympics in 2004 against the Dream Team won.
My favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won the team gold and the US is a struggle, as when it against us in the World Cup won bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario" Quixote "Morales, the 1990 due to a knee injury, it was not.
A team that in terms of personalities, perhaps not the best, but we won a gold medal and great joy, who was on the vorolympischen tournament in 1995, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, contrary to every forecast, we won the gold medal.
Who was the best players from Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico, at this level so as Piculín dominated.
And that, without his career in different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys like the work of Leo Arill well.
What you think is the best thing that you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, the beginning of the 1990s BSN up to 17 teams in a season.
What you have to do?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and only play in the national playoffs to teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children make many unnecessary travel and games.
At least I can see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, official and referee.
I am proud of that.
What do you play today?
I listen to music, see my time in music videos from YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
