Birth in space
In danger.
Global warming or collision with killer for.
Caravans of pilgrims from Lysians with people on board are on the search for a spare planet.
In order to save the human race, the important question of how we in the zero gravity or the spare planet breed?
There are many choices, in my opinion, is not.
In fact, there are only two real planet we inhabit could at least hypothetical.
"Namely Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff of the Astrological Institute Vladimir Surdin Sternberg.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life, on the surface of Venus, a temperature of up to 500 degrees.
Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The issue of reproduction in space, the researchers first in terms of the flora.
Already half a century before that have been carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the bred peas differed not in the slightest by the alien species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, from tiny fruit fly (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, barrel organ quail were sent into space to explore how the weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It is a normal chicks.
But then the problem.
"The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it must stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew.
Without deep underground, the wild chickens.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn stumpften completely.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
Four days later, they died.
"We have two chicks hatch and then the whole thing, simply because it is impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew holds the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding kennel with animals flew 16 years ago in orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments.
However, on the BIOS-Manager atel# specialist beers "Bion" only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilised were sent into space.
In principle, it was nothing special.
"It was just the BIOS-Manager atel# specialist beers, but again, it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue," said Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing of the space Rats offspring.
The issue of reproduction directly in space, we have not yet been resolved.
The task is difficult.
Animals from their natural habitat are torn, simply do not follow their reproductive drove.
In contrast to animals could be the man that in principle.
Homo sapiens is Abstraktem thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women already fly into space for 50 years.
There was the biggest risk in Tereshkova.
The most valuable, humanity, is the female body.
Our gull flew, and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is it the space flight?
It will be after this flight can bring a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered this question," says space veteran Svogerslev Watschnadse tang.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female Kosmonautin, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also only.
In 1988 bare the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who twice in orbit and was even doing work outside the space vehicle, a son.
, remains a risk.
We only have very few cosmonaut, where, after long flights, everything went well and healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even for flights into orbit," concludes only Valery Poliakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, the race for new ways of biotechnology, radiation protection and the building of artificial gravity.
The monobenzyl laboratory in the preparation of Idaho, is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of flux win the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
Water is the feeling of weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a strange surroundings, but infants are water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony to them that life in the country, turning the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months in the belly of the mother is on the water, and that it will be easier to get water.
In principle, this is logical, as from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little time to forget," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Aksenowa Marina.
While for a newborn child the feeling of weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the loss and lap muscles rapidly back and so is the ability of squeezing the child.
Well, we deal with the birth at the chief tool.
The birth could, for example, take place in a special chamber, squeezing the child.
"But what happens then?" Is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poliakov.
On the other hand, the child also artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung feel, can the organism the skeleton and muscles do not.
A newborn baby is not as an adult in the training in a contamination suit.
It is simply the lack of what his life is of fundamental importance.
"This experiment that we work together, which is the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will mean that we have a disability, a completely unangepassten will bring people to the world," says the head of the ethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space just a theory.
At some point, but it will be a reality, if the people in their Lysians to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space.
