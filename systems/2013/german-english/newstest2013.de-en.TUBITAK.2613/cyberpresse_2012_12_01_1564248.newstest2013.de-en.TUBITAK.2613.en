A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center, the latter is a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers, the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the United States for the conduct of the elections in the individual States.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedures for the registration and the ballot.
This phenomenon has after the elections in November 2010 in importance where 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States could be recorded.
As a result, 180 bills introduced in 2011, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.
The new election laws require that the voters a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also periods for the early vote, the right declared invalid, on election day to register as voters and citizens the right to vote, for which a court acts.
Before the elections of 2006, a state of the electorate requires a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008, the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to this practice should be extended to other States.
Over the last two years, they encouraged in 34 States draft legislation with which the voters will have a photo ID.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identity card as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, in other words, 21 million voters people not by a government authority of their state issued photo ID.
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012, does not have such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay for the required ID.
Of the new restrictions are young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo ID.
This is further.
The students who are regarded as voters their voice more for Democratic candidates, it is not allowed in several States, from its establishment issued photo identification to use.
On the other hand, members of the same States allow Angel- or hunting clubs that are more on the Republican side to choose which of these associations issued cards for elections.
In 2004, a federal state for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state that such a request.
In 2011, a dozen States have passed legislation that voters are demanding that their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters, the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators in eight States laws in 2011, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups, to offer help to those voters who would like to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the general elections in 2004, approximately 10 million citizens to register.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 to 17%.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other States adopted laws aimed at the period for the early vote.
For example, were in the general elections in 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they only 13% of voters in the state.
The same is true for the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of people who have chosen in advance.
By contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been affected by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
You were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States adopted laws that require photo identification showing.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012, no doubt, the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws passed by and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the crucial States for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes, the electoral college are needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.
