A cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the outcome of the inquiry confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."
He hid it in his family.
He decided to take up just about his illness and started to inform themselves; and that with such dedication that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the humane immundefizienz# virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s was hard to imagine that there are many doubts, few treatment options and more murderous mata.
Then it avoided even the director of a clinic of the MSSI to adopt, "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS at the time was a synonym for death.
Today, it is possible that this syndrome with quality of life to survive.
However, many people still come to the clinic, which none of their disease and know where the virus has already caused damage and her immune system has run out, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, "means the great success that the survival of patients, the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly right," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, but he said that this information in April this year by a reputable scientific publication had been based.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life of the extent of the deterioration of the immune system of people depended on the beginning of the treatment, and that those who have greater opportunities, which are dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a count of 200 and 50 years by a count of 500 by.
Simply put, the above comments mean that anyone under the age of 25 years, the diagnosis is HIV positive, in this sense, "can be easily 75 years old, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
This progress, to be reminded that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduces), it is nevertheless true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of the national database covers patients have died.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until the month of May this year there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that it since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral drugs.
Die - Why so people still remember?
- In my opinion, is the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs, the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they are unaware of their infection status, in other words, very late stages of the disease.
He makes a strong statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnosis, which is why all the people, where it is needed, screening tests need to be offered on a massive scale."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de las del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio, of his test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS era was, and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (a krebsart# hoş tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and want to hear nothing.
"If I was going to die, then three times to burst," says one in my case.
The change was to suggest improvement, I ernähre me good practise sport and take the drugs.
Now know his parents only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I am working, do a lot, have an active and responsible sex lives, I respect to my health and that of the other person," numbereth Fabrizio, the ” its intimate details with Milenio JALISCO, in order to encourage those with his testimony today in the context of world AIDS Day fear.
You should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they will learn how to live as all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In this particular places "was the distribution of condoms actually increases; previously, they were made separately, now they give us packages with a hundred piece, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
To the high-risk individuals for new infections among young people.
"Why do you need?" Is a common taunt issue of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and healthcare system, the young people do not want to expose them, the correspondent.
He suggested that these inefficient distribution newly oriented; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but output devices in public toilets of institutions, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether, under his administration would be distributed condoms.
"Sexuality is not enough; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is seen nationally in 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the cases of infection are about sex, 6% on the blood and 2% Val ship.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because for every registered case 4 or 5, there are people who do not know.
