The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court, the law on voluntary work.
That decision provoked a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting, the issue of a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, with rampant financial speculation goes hand in hand.
Because of the large differences in the value of work (wages) to price tensions.
Under this concept is a condition to understand where the manufacturers tried to import cheaper goods in economic competition, making the competition "offers" to a larger market share to usurp and to increase its profits.
On a large scale means that for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since the private capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for what he has caused unemployment to rise necessarily government spending.
This situation will be exacerbated by the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling, to pay their taxes and thus the overall social, economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics at this point are superfluous.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, at the social level to artificially reduce their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to its own people to force the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages to accept.
This is partly due to economic constraints in long-term unemployment, on the other by the erosion of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there has been some years, public food distribution to the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases in which workers are paid so little that the state of their income to the subsistence needs to increase.
Such a scandal, even in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity of virtually all EU-SÃ¼dstaaten will no doubt be on the same condition, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century was the case), or for a pittance on the fringes of society and about whom to hope that at some point, private investment capital flowing into the country.
There is, of course, the question of where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty of one country to another, or from the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or even the employees working in Africa for a fraction of the European wages.
The whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state not with capital to its own economy is involved, and that a planned economy to economic disaster.
Private capital is parochial in its position that the government will not intervene lenkend in the economy.
But then we must ask whether the private capital politics and that the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual advantage, legislation in which practically everything reprehensible, but nothing is a punishable offence.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department because of a lack of finances private, with the industry interdependent legal action with the drafting of legislative proposals.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All the violence is no longer the folk, as the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly in a situation like the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic's times and Rubicon explains: "The state has long been in collapse, and the offices were filled with violence.
Against bribes, illegal eighty-year-old's permitted by of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption has grown incontinent, and the people involved have already purchased votes to elect "..." people with nature is not applied for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul "..." You really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a dictatorship, and that a strong man to be elected "... Appian thought of it, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, is today's society, as well as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of their own advantage, without on societal interests.
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognize and enforce.
The result, now, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least for deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the current state of view, the fall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies are seen as a break in the next round already.
Especially appalling is the fact that today's elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have witnessed already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we have it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on voluntary work here is not the solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways the social level to push down the population.
This trend is therefore system.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms, the participation of the state of the economy, the influence of the people on the government and the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the state.
