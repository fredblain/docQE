Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could be unexpected cornerstone for peace to
Can it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations, countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and the Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally end.
A war that neither will be won or lost
At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation is anything but.
Even if the on 21 November agreed ceasefire continues, this week's fighting the tough-minded on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, even though his group even large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desolate and densely ’ s corners of the planet will be squeezed, it is Israel until now failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah controlled.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have grown in influence, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a heavy, regional power that once regarded as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas party - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most Gulf States.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly Islamic stamp care before the Stürzung Bashar Assad might be, to Jordan, where Hamas allied to the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, by far the largest population and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders more public opinions.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be a player, even from Israel and the United States will not be pushed out.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, an opposite conclusion.
Militarily speaking, Hamas is not a threat.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome", has been able to stand the test of time and many of the Hamas rockets are destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in its position, many European countries have Hamas for the recent escalation of violence.
Israel has in recent years have fared well, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004, some 30 Israelis have been killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the security wall has, in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state œwar. They protect the Jewish settlements, which is in contravention of international law has been declared, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu is doing well, his Likud Party, in the run-up to the elections on January 22, Avigdor Lieberman, with an even more allied fighting earlier group.
Why this crafty nanny Palestinians and give them a state?
If they really have control over the West Bank, they would not like their colleagues in the Gaza Strip fire rockets, too?
No, it is better to have them behind the wall to contain and punish, should they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps it will be able to enforce the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could have stopped them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries are in power, little left for Israel, they will look first to the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments not to help repair its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust a ceasefire could be a promising sign, and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Even Israelis should long-term thinking.
While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination, a powder keg, which no doubt one day in the Israeli occupied territories will explode, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The answer is that the more reasonable people on both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper: two States, where Israel for security purposes areas with its tail between its legs.
For the near future, the small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar the arms into the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial swaps and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
Outsiders Arab nations should also Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
That would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state was done with the forthcoming request for un-beobachter# status.
Obama, too, must do its part, Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he lost the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were equally unwilling to participate.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
