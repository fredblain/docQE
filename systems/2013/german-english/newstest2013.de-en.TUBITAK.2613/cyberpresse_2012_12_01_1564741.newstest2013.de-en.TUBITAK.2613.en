Prostate cancer screening: if the test should be made or not?
In fact, the PSA-Test sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater reluctance of already undecided men for the implementation of Früherkennungstests.
The test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies conducted in the United States were many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without screening.
This study has also shown that a observation after 12 years, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30% to 40% higher if no screening was conducted.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when a direct relatives, who has been ill with prostate cancer.
In men African American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as a cancer was detected.
There are cancers, the aggressive and others, where the Indo-European.
The patients, the extent of the risk of cancer is made clear by the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate Tata crab, if it is the quality of life in the long term is not affected, and in these cases is more of an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many of the men, where cancer has recognised, no treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and not a threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
It certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who does not.
I therefore recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.
The most important thing is, however, to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international society for Urology as Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible that the pros and cons of the widespread PSA testing.

The disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all good enough to eat and move.
"If there is no smoking, it would be at least a 50% increase," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unresolved.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
You seem to be the risk of breast, fierce appendix, fattening appendix, Speiseröhren, Bauchspeicheldrüsen and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against fierce colorectal cancer," he added.
The diet
The organisation also recommends that the consumption of red meat.
In great quantities, it increases the risk of wrath or fattening of developing colorectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins.
In recent years, several scientists, the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their investigations, however, is not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
While a study to reduce the risk of prostate cancer was discovered, showed another rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family to talk about the long-term degradation.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
