Šimon Ornest: at our concerts, we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month ago, the world is to take place?
This is one of those emergency messages to the people are so happy to pounce.
With our band The tap tap, we are more fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which can collect enough positive energy in the world to stop or prevent.
In December, you realize a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraiser, which we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which end on 21 December at 11:10 a.m. is forecast.
The day before, on 20 December, from 21:00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which, in a time zone at 12 hours ahead of the Mayan calendar ends.
Comes from whom this idea?
Originally, from me, then we have the idea, together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We would like not only collect enough positive energy in the world, but we also want, together with the public to think about the state of the world, even our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the world, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz us people also can support.
The band The tap tap, together with other performers also the so-called anthem against the world with the title "world comes from".
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will also ring on the numerous concerts?
Of course, finally, provided that all is fine, and the world is not taking place...
The anthem of all the performers in all three concerts at the same time be sung.
In addition, the hymns together in a direct interconnection of Czech television broadcast live.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X with...
How did you come to the cooperation with two?
We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, which is that we realize many events and concerts.
We are working hard these people involved in our projects.
It has shown that the most interest in working with us, and have fun.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts to benefit the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, on which we are already six years together with the club Jedlička-Institut tap in.
The pupils of the Jedlička-Instituts are regularly maintained by teachers, help with various leisure activities.
As the students do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the completion of the Jedlička-Instituts is a private building, in which we do with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers.
On what criteria you have chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Learn everything else on the Website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to see in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are already in the United States, this would also like to appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their overseas plans are not just small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The tap tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities.
How you deal with these travel logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the baggage area. We must also, of course, many instruments and other baggage PreCise mitschleppen...
Nonetheless, it has always worked without any problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I am sometimes surprised some.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there have been no problems.
Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison, as in the individual countries with accessibility, how they deal with people with disabilities.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Russia, in the East is still in its infancy.
Moscow towards Prague is absolutely not disabled. There, it is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even there, of course, that a wheelchair lift, for example, in Newport.
Fortunately, there are also clubs that try to address the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we have to the more developed countries catch up?
There are still many things on which we are lagging behind.
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities Selbsthilfegruppe constantly in the public sphere, go into a museum, will be able to use toilets and so on.
But it is not normal that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in the public arena, we are with the band The tap tap a little ahead of the West.
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when one of our own great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly Spirit strong personalities.
The tap tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a couple of years: what did you do in 1998, a band?
Then I started as carers in Jedlička-Institut, where I met many young people who were interested in a little hard to deal with.
And since I myself am and musicians including Papa games, I, together with a colleague a Musik-AG.
Na, and, over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, say, a little out of control (laughs).
The band was known but only in the last few years, and I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped; we have also started to campaign actively for us.
We know that if something is on the outside, and this is not to see their own performance, in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to the extra toothbrushes can we are good teachers, high quality equipment, etc.
It was your goal, it with The tap tap so far?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that we can deal with things differently.
In show business today often copied one of the other.
That is on its way, logical, since anything new with caution, and only after a long time will be accepted.
There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that tap tap.
The first impression of the spectators usually is, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities not lonely and desolate nature, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities in something, not just for themselves a step forward, but for the whole of society.
It was for this success also helps you to be a tough boss, how many people listening?
If you want to make something good, we must not compromise on many things, and also has a degree of discipline.
But I think that this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have tested twice a week, preparatory stages and have to spend a lot of time to spend on concert tours, then extinguished the enthusiasm among many quickly.
How it works but everywhere, in every band work seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The tap tap 20 members.
How many of them were from the very beginning, since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. That cannot be prevented.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to contribute, is always welcome.
