The architects MVRDV demonstrate that the real adventure is not only in the head, in the case of Spijkenisse and the newly-created but - 2 photos
"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally, there are some interesting things to see," said Lisette Verhaig, represents a pass at the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby large operations, says: "But, well, it is already the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and electronic books.
No man is still on a voluntary basis, in one of these old-style Public License?
Spijkenisse, a little sightseeing needy sleeper town at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80.000# Elbe-Lübeck community has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands.
To counter this silly circumstance, we decided a few years ago, the general education and the seven fictional bridges on the euro, are portrayed as nicely bepinselt steel concrete recreate tradition.
The success of the educational offensive in.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way, the statistics to be: a library needs.
Winy Maas from Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV, master of this bold (and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared to contest hearing in 2003 with five books refreshs arm and a grin on the face.
And while the jury is still intrigued with the axillae looked and fellow, stacks of impudent Maas his fine souvenir of the size of a pyramid and finished his three owned a well-founded speech with the words: "Dear municipality."
It is, in other words, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called boeken Senegalo!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro toillette Berg causeway.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes Econtel supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, but the second "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award nominated 2012.
This is the faceless small city retorte, which until now had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, with its white façades you're inclined, a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass.
There is a lift, which runs through the middle of a mountain, but the real space and BookmarksEdit delights the tap fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The fully glazzing interior is bright and clear, the world enjoys floors and elegant Sanniquellie clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for park bench, dog and football playing guys and Mädels.
, and books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually cockroche and impersonal way," says Winy Maas.
We have the classic space configuration on the head and the reading area inside out terms.
The interior of the book Mountain is shrewdly: in the middle are offices, Internetbibliothek, chess club, environmental centre and the house.
A particular pleasure, the black bookshelves, wall paneling, black, even if several countries.
Optics, and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and Civil Engineers whether shake the Organice deliberately-controlled hitting the head.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop ’ s borst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen agricultural farm one day at a waste product from agriculture.
For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimetre thin plastic fleece as root document.
This is cheap and efficient.
The thin textiles, one or two seasons ’ events, then it is ready for the bins.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure to become the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogenous, capable of incriminating material to concede a Neuwagen and concede after sports shoe.
After 105 stages is at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long wandering the literary cafe with not only a fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch delicacies and eingetopft Ficus trees rewarded.
For atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in literature.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this is in spite of the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology," says ’ s borst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the book under a glass Senegalo collapse, it seems that the sun even on sunny days only briefly into the interior.
The broad wood glue binder, on the glass facade, serve as Beschattung and catch a large part of the sun.
The climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic Rollos do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry that has been the way in the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, the boeken Senegalo even Spijkenisses "long-overdue soul".
The reason: to open a few weeks ago, any residents invited to a book from his personal stock.
That is for the time being, even the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 piece - be filled.
The concept is work.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
MVRDV is the royal discipline managed, in the jargon of the identity.
Has Spijkenisse literary history.
As young and uneducated, they may be.
This is a starting point for identity.
