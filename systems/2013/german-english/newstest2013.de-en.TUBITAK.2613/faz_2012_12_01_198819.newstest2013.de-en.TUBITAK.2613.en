"Trademark protection in China: if Puma and Armani suddenly be Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Conceals a China officially registered name, but nothing to do with the company.
However, it is protected as long as the actual name employers do not complain.
And even then, it is not clear whether they are right.
"There will be more difficult for foreigners, to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Tel-Peh stalemate, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing, to safeguard rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The Nachahmern rich a few additional letters, so that they can register their trademarks.
It is simply Lu-Gucci from Gucci, Prada, Prada-Kny.
Also German companies are legally copied in this way, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate Takaris opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company trademarks Zegna City Puma, an art names, which is also the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese world champion in the copying and the injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are mehrstöckige department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
Stalemate hole cases but are different: on behalf of its clients, it is the fact that Chinese companies from Trademarks officially gained the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai", a passenger's brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
There are women who are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no fault
"This is bad for business, you have to fight it," requireth Tel-Peh stalemate.
"The brand will be diluted, the only treatment disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA is China, with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Up to nine years, the proceedings drag on, with an uncertain outcome.
Stalemate Takaris reports of cases in which the court overruled Lamentations because, after the long duration of the reported name of "reality".
If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money because it violated its trademark in China, says Tel-Peh stalemate.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases concern also graphical elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the completing manufacturer Sany, the company that recently the German concrete pump manufacturer shine Champion.
The Chinese must therefore use until now an emblem, the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyers Geely originally used a blue white logo, BMW recalled; the dispute was resolved, Geely has had to change it.
The fashion manufacturers Lacoste lost in China against followers from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The Trademarks CTMO in Beijing is that there is 2010 due to lack of staff and equipment shortages.
Last year, however, is one of the "state of emergency in the work flow returned to normal life."
So is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure has fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, in the office are still 81.500 appeals to fulfillment.
It costs a lot to
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and meant that China is the tenth consecutive year, the list of new messages around the world, shares the authority.
This holds true for the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011 were 1.8 billion yuan to charges have been taken.
Simplified, this means that on average, every T7s4s 1280 yuan or 160 euros costs.
Address it costs a lot more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans were able to achieve its illegal manufacture the imitation of motor vehicle parts have been closed down.
But secured the followers continue the Chinese rights to the brand of Freudenberg.
We have failed to do this, as in Germany, family name could not be protected, said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical specialities in Munich.
The Trademarks CTMO rejected the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two bodies while Freudenberg was right, but opponents of the process is still continuing.
Must be extremely
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and will cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could be difficult to quantify, the company archive have even a hundred years old files to look at, in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, the other side of Freudenberg in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to settle.
"This shows how much we value is," says Wentzler.
Even threaten the dangers in the Far East to Europe zurückzuschwappen.
Then, if there are imitators vulnerable brands.
This was a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, the name of Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This area of business, the company has long since been abandoned, yet he has the registration.
"We must be extremely carefully," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate Takaris rates German companies from doing business with China to be very careful.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather should the foreigners' everything is somehow worth protecting, China sign "as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if the last act of his trademark Freudenberg drama is governed, then we should do the opposite royalties on its own behalf, Wentzler explained.
In the segment in question or we will be squeezed out of the market.
