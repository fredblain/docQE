"The brain is so far only moderately outsmart"
The supporters of modern technologies popular subject of enlarged to become a reality in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
First, Google in the summer at its annual conference, a working model, in November was aware that Microsoft had filed a patent.
In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, will be clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
You talked about the possibility of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and virtual free land.
You, please, what research your group.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, however, want the limits of this interaction.
So far, the human race largely stuck in the period, with pixels on flat screens, which sometimes are affected.
However, we want to look ahead 10 years and the radical changes this interaction predict.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect-Sensoren a step forward, and today is no longer sold without Xbox Kinect, as all for motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect interaction on a physical level, is much more on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The submission of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We are trying to change that, are working on real three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We need the computer world in our physical world and make it more tangible.
This, however, it is necessary not only to the user, but also its surroundings.
We could then the real world much easier through virtual objects.
And first of all, we should this silly virtual reality helmets -Proporcional!
- What do you think about language control?
It is popular, but it is not overvalued?
- it is certainly not the general solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always all others about his actions and intentions to inform.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers, however, each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of management of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and tight, rather than sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not of the object, but by a bracelet recorded the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
It is still relatively high, however, could in theory be reduced the size of a wristwatch.
But on the whole, however, the future belongs to mixed management types, for example, gestures and language.
- How?
- We would like to ask, for example, you this romantic to estrelar?
You say it and suggest, at the same time.
Normally, I would say it simply.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- means that you want the adapts to the user, what a machine at the relevant time can afford and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I believe that in the coming months, especially in the development of new types of sensors must be working to enable the reactions of people to grasp.
The can, for example, laser sensors because they are in the depth of a good resolution, which is very important.
- What claims you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect-Sensoren to modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, would be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1,000 fps not bad.
But the main thing is not the camera itself, but the quality of the Matrix and depth.
In this respect, all current technologies are not good enough, as the developer of the Algorithmen more work.
It is not only the dissolution along the X and the yttria, but also along z axis.
The speed and the number of frames per second are important.
The movements of the people are very dynamic and, frankly, are the current 30 fps especially for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes entwickelte in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.
For my work, I was just such a device, only without touch control and more frames per second.
The number of cameras - Müsste not be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", with one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object deep.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It was not a flexible, Kinect-ähnliches system where we could play with different camera interest to see how we do in the three-dimensional identifying a position helps.
If I remember correctly, Microsoft, Google, in contrast to his glasses, not the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the glasses has the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant, always a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: the neatest variant would be a "rotating" enhanced reality, in which we have a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone could switch,
The lens is a personal Gadget and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but also its weakness, because an extended reality through glasses, together with others that you can work with virtual objects.
- places us for a moment that the manipulation of virtual club was in the air not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal.
There is a problem that critics often point out this idea: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing at all.
The answers to your group to this point?
- In my lectures, I often talk of the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is the use of second hand as something unusual projection document.
It takes pressure perfectly true!
But there are also technologies, which are aimed at the "pictures in the air" to provide a robust, for example, the number of Immink 386,798 ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where the finger, a feeling that at the moment, however, is so weak, as pustete someone on the knuckles.
There are also bands for the wrist on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
We think that it feels, what it would feel if it is just a little?
- This is a good idea, so we have not yet tried.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, a man who is physically in a closed room to believe that he is, instead, in an open, virtually infinite space; here, we are working on concepts with bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms, as well as large balls.
So far, the brain only moderately, and we still have many years of hard work.
That makes the work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: on many issues, we are only just beginning.
