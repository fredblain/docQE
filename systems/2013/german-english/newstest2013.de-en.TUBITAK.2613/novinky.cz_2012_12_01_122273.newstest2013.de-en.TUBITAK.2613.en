"The people want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," Okamura said.
Senator, how is it possible to get the idea for the office of the president to stand?
It is not about Senator or to be president.
In our country, everything would work without any problems, I would get nowhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free, while the people of the taxes and the retirement age will be increased.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something, which I do not like it, then I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I have over 40, and independent and parteilos, I have no other way to influence things than for senator or the president to stand for election.
In the Senate, you have done it and then straight on the road to the castle.
They do not return to your constituents?
I have said all the time that I fight for the castle after the outcome of the senatorial elections will begin.
Later, I have this clarified and said that I stand for the office of president, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function. Function is a tool with which I can realise my vision.
I need as much influence as possible, and a strong mandate.
The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television grumbles, but anyone that wants to make a difference.
Come to the media, a privileged kid, and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
For me, for example, claims that journalists would be bribed or that I consultants Jiří Paroubek.
We are talking about your vision.
The battle for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as retrospective asset declarations about 20 million crowns.
You need to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have campaigned for the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone from the right or the left with a good proposal, rejected this deliberately, and that keeps the population only.
As an independent party and I have a much greater potential to support all the parties represented in parliament to win.
My advantage is that I am already without thinking and party dogma of every party that can take what is best for our country.
Watch as a man in politics rather than on the left or the right?
From Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people see more on the left.
For me, this is right and left but completely irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
It is not a question of whether someone on the left or the right, I would like the people.
I am always publicly any good approach, even if these KSČM or of the ODS, and just as I am against bad ideas.
They dislike you, if someone calls you as populists.
But you do not confirm this, what you just said?
If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have an ideal destination and a vision.
And if you want to do.
This can be described as far as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to work in the world, or they were key experts.
But without support in Parliament will remain just slogans.
And that brings you in politics in the long term, not far.
Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk with the people, we will be able, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to convince them on our side, in order to enforce these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to call on the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law.
And the addressee may then have to say why they oppose it.
A strong personality, which draws on abuses can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which is a credit to the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to allies for my views and visions.
With the policy, I have only just begun and testing my programme for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I am going to six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I can not alone; that is why I have spoken with a number of well-known personalities, whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with Radim Jančura, but rejected due to excessive workloads.
In addition, I have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, the fraud in the sale of light fuel oil.
My candidacy, I started with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of voters are not at all to the elections, and those who are gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people have chosen such a Isauricus composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and county main men.
Do you think about the creation of a party?
I have not yet thought, because I have no time, the past each potential member of the party, and do not have the money.
I have not even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
You have no money?
You are talking about asset declarations, what would you?
I appreciate my personal wealth to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a home for some 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million, and then I have a few million in the bank account.
The Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I have always liked James Bond, as he was in the car, to women and, at the same time, he was fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you do not want to invest in it.
This is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make some debt?
I have already 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that the program is not too much interest.
And I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But the support for Titus I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son, not the English school fund 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing.
So you will continue to operate as an entrepreneur, your livelihood?
You said that you go back to these activities?
But that does not depend on the level of salary.
As promised, I have my activities partly reduced.
Thus, for example, my deputy in the spring, managing director of the travel agents.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan, of the Republic.
But I must but also of something.
Monthly income on which you were used as entrepreneurs?
Around 200,000 to 400,000, and that remains the case.
As President, I would, but my endeavors.
