Szabo: "German must play a greater role."
Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, positioned in Berlin on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it is against the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then, Berlin.
Why?.
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it is not the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without, however, critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to set up a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, enforced by NATO.
It is difficult for Germany on major international issues to take a clear position?
Yes, that is true.
This is because it is surrounded by his foreign policy and away from a policy of the United States pay, as it were, to a German foreign policy.
Compounding the problem, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are so between the fronts.
Expected of them, that they have a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I believe that they are keys to their role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness of national interests to take positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy, economic policy is driven by exports and its relationship to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
They have economic interests to influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful, the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries not to upset.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining on major decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this is such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany so that even a certain respect, too.
Because it signals that it as an international player to be taken seriously and his interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, have been clear for a veto.
There are differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government can this position publicly, of course, not.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they are.
If you are the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so upbeat about of Netanyahu â€™ s policies.
It is difficult to Germany, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side?
I believe that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case today.
So they can not be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position.
That they do precisely with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role, Europe to a European position.
This is, of course, not just for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they have a more independent role to play.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to take a leading role at all?
Or is the leadership is still difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, that every time Germany takes on a greater role, a variety of anti-German sentiment.
This makes it the Germans not easy.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
There must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European policy continues, the EU is filling the vacuum at the moment, but not who is otherwise?
The Germans are simply need to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them and they are much less popular, c'est la vie.
