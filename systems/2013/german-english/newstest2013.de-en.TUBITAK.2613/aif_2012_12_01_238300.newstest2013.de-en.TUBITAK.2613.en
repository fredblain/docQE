"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activist discuss what benefit the law on binding language tests for migrants, act as criminals with fake certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to raise money for the upkeep of the remaining families in the country.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every working immigrant a test, the knowledge of the Russian language, must take.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants in the services sector, in the local housing economy and want to work in the retail sector.
However, the tests with the time, according to FÃ¶deraler migration authority in the future for all migrant workers on duty.
We must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills, both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian an official language.
Also are exempt from this law, their training certificates and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, and protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the audit will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of international hospitality, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants will be able to take the tests in all the cities; in Russia were already more than 160 similar centres.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests, the members of the State Duma and the Federal immigration authority.
Civil rights activist, on the other hand, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press, the following question: what is it all about?
What changes is the rule, language skills to deliver, both for the Russians as well as for the guest workers?
Above all, spokesman for the immigration authorities say, is concerned, the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the office of the Federal immigration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
But their rights must be protected even before their departure.
An organized recruitment will be 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills inevitably people with bad intentions will meet him on the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow cabin, where he and dozens of his peers months without food and documents endure and 12 to 14 hours a day of toil.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home will give you the A promised, and cheated on arrival, you will get their passports taken and do not receive the promised reward", the head of the Directorate for labour migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not complaining, boss!
Yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia want to earn their money, that it is not only the language of the country do not dominate, but also in their own language can hardly express in writing.
Of course, that is not their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only a sound basic education.
Because in their families, there is not even money, in order to feed the children, let alone them decent clothes, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager, these children will then take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills", give it to you.
"You feel humiliated and degraded."
Civil rights activist stress on the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, there is no test and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the bulk of the migrant workers continue to illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "entry ban for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants to confirm that it is not easy in Russia, an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Also costs the legalisation of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police are aware that our largely falsified documents and we are not registered, and it then cases of blackmail.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers.
Earlier in the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates, the completion of the language tests that have already been of staff told the Federal immigration authority.
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: every migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official review: this is a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, not just the certificates can be purchased, are both officials and civil rights activist agreed.
For the moment, the authorities of immigrant workers, the first time by the test, only promise that it is time for a language base rate.
In addition, new arrivals without language offered jobs in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
