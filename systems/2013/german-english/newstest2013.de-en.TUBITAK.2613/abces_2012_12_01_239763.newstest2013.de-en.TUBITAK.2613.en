The most difficult job in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they are 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is hell, and others are literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has every day down to the bottom of its crater, where the from the earth ausströmende gas containing sulphur in contact with the air entrenched.
After he has broken out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope stone paths.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is up to a height of 2386 metres, but the weary bodies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the pace of turtle, with the balance and keep their steps need to be careful so that they do not slip and crash.
You know that every step you can cost lives, as a French tourist happened years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted.
The mine of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each kilogram of sulphur, which reduce them.
At the top, it tracks the path between the tourists who shoot them like circus affen and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company a little below at an altitude of 1850 metres set
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (never better) said its workers, whom they 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Which they then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because of this mineral in everyday life is widespread and the manufacture of wooden matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar is used.
"As we normally 70 kg, we receive for each way about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," said Anto us, usually three flights a day.
For each route it needs three hours that he is completely at the end of the day, but then he has 138,000 breast cancers detected rupees (11.5 euros).
What a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine here, where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be paid on the day and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167), is very high," said the winner, the previously as bricklayers on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason, in Indonesia, as important as the sulphur is: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I did it for Java, for them to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often a coughing fit and his eyes are due to the toxic gases to sex.
Of the 27 years since three years ago, Anto puts his life at risk Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur in him the first mark, although his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often a coughing fit and his eyes are because of the toxic gases from the volcano to sex.
This is the price he pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I will be here for another two years of work, because I have a shop Wegbeschreibung or Spanish or French would like to learn," he promises in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or at the front desk of a hotel, but instead, he has done the work of a key esels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other agencies and, every day at 2 p.m. on the sulphur also emit at night, with its distinctive yellow color in the darkness is hot.
The shadow of challenging, it is in the light of a small head lamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money into the crater.
About 400 bodies on the floor of the crater, the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company reducing sulphur careers in order to save on costs and returns the agencies that work on their own account and will be paid by weight, no equipment.
You also get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this Natureparks together with the entrance fees in excess of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) by the tourists, the shooting of the volcano and the lovely Aasee wing.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" Madrusin protested a stämmiger, 42 years old vehicle, the three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen works.
He is capable of up to 110 kg and assured that he will be continued, "as long as it is," because he has the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here, because of the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and eyes palmo-plantar when the wind suddenly and revolves around the mine in the thick pillars can become trapped in the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains about serious diseases... of course, in addition to the usual breathing problems, Arthrose, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back with his 53 years Unainik is a capable of 50 kg.
Break every day, he and his companions 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, the three trucks on a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari in 18 miles away.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because of the volcano my whole life," explains Unainik, with his mouth wide open, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elders with his 30 years as Schwefel-Träger.
As time passes, but the meagreness of, generation upon generation in one of the hardest job in the world: those who act as the lovely Aasee Kawah Ijen human cargo.
