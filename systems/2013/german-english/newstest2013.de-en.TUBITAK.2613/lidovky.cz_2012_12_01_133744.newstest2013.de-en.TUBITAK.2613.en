The film Argo: if it's the worst that Hollywood calls
In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they were asking for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the revolution had fled to the United States, for decades the Board on his regime had maintained.
For the American government, there has been no positive outcome from this situation, they could not afford, to throw out the Shah as the confidence of their allies in other countries have been severely damaged.
At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime led to the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in violent attempt the hostage exemption made it even worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages, home to a wave of solidarity, as well as an Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, the United States a partial victory.
Just before the occupation of the message, six embassy staff the flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; it helped them an extravagant story to Verdeckung their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports posing as members of a film Staff, who was allegedly in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination the genres
The experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, entwickelte plan also made the cooperation needed in Hollywood.
The camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in journals, press conferences have been held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic check, but at the same time, a so-called "Caper Movie" is the story of a successful piece of Communist, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the 1988 documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence will be shown in other contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easy to exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions, men in suits at the conference table, on the official fluren, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is with this film a remarkable start to his career.
From a bel√§chelten actor is a respected director and actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third feature film after the whodunit No breeze (Her Baby Away, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, not in the home of the director of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the Hollywood standard definition.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played".
The best scenes of the film to play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is in its simplicity, very impressive, and it still conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when somewhere the history.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film unit at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much in too many places plot
The director also had to deal with that, the story is not many in the filmic sense exciting scenes.
With the little but he has been quite successful, but the reality is sometimes a bit - which is not always so elegantly works (the scenes in which the looming crisis in Tehran at the airport by a telephone call in America will be turned away, or even the chase on the runway, something curious).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is driven by the need for a lot of action in too many places to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, in their roles as Hollywood staff is very charming, but their characters would have more space, and that they are in the film is far from alone.
It loses something Afflecks film temptingness. It is a movie, the one with some interest in the design and a thriller from the 70th years can approve reminiscent of retro style.
Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult.
As a reminder of a date in some way living piece of history, and as evidence of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, but it is enough.
