<h1>
<seg id="1">A republican strategy in order to confront the re-election of Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The managements of the republicans justify its politics with the necessity, to fight the choice fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">To be sure the Brennan center latter considers to be a myth in that it strengthens, that the choice fraud more rarely is in the USA than the amount of the person killed by the lightning strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lawyers of the republicans indicated only 300 cases of choice fraud in 10 years in the USA by the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One is certain: these new determinations will affect negatively the voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures undermine partially the democratic system of the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to Canada, the US states is responsible for the execution of the choices in the single countries.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this sense, the majority of the American governments announced since 2009 new laws, that impede the procedure for the registration or the going to the polls.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon became more meaningful after the choices of the November 2010, with which 675 new republican representatives in 26 countries could be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result 180 bill were introduced alone in 2011, that restrict the execution of the right to vote in 41 countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new choice laws demand that the voters produce a photo identification card and a proof of the US country citizenry.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition the periods are shortened through these laws also for the premature voting, arranged that declares right to be invalidly to register themselves at the election day as a voter, and citizens the right to vote, for which a court document exists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the choices of 2006, no US country of the voters demanded to show a photo identification card.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first state that raised such a demand.</seg>
<seg id="15">The colonel court of the United States confirmed the constitution temperance of the law of Indiana in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">The republican authorities hurried to expand this practice to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the course of the last two year, they promoted in 34 states of bill, with which the voters are forced to show a photo identification card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It importantly is to be noticed in that the US citizens does not control in contrast to Quebec an universal identification card card such as the health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the deed possess 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million entitled to vote people no photo identification card issued by a government authority its country.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition five million reelections in 2012 do not control such an identification card.</seg>
<seg id="21">To be sure more are to be paid frequently than hundred dollars in order to received the required identification card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Of the new restrictions, young people, minority and people with low income disproportionately strongly are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the deed, $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years do not control 25% of the Afro Americans, 15% of the people with an income of less than the required photo identification card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This passes along yet.</seg>
<seg id="25">It the student, whom are not looked at as a voter, whom deliver its voice increased for democratic candidates, is permitted in several countries to use its photo identification card issued by its arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand the same countries permit it members of hinge society or hunt society, who select more strongly for the republican side, to use the cards issued by these societies for choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, no state demanded for the selecting a proof of the country citizenry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state that introduced such a demand.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011 dismissed a dozen of countries of laws, that demand of the voters, that they prove its US country citizenry.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures aim clearly on that to limit the hispanischen voices.</seg>
<seg id="31">For it lies on the hand that two of three hispanischen voters that democratic party prefer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition republican legislators 2011 in eight states of laws promoted, with whom the registration was abolished by voters at the election day.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition you restricted the right of individual and groups to perform those voters aid position, that would like to register itself.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example the campaigns to the voter registration contributed in the general choices 2004 in addition, ca. To register 10 millions of citizen.</seg>
<seg id="36">For through the measures dismissed since 2009, the share of the registration by reelections 2010 in comparison with 2006 diminished itself around 17%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Moreover the republican legislators in five further states of laws dismissed, who aim on that to shorten the period for the premature voting.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example were in the general choices 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters, that selected in advance, Afro American although they settle only 13% of the voters of the state.</seg>
<seg id="39">Same applies to the hispanische population.</seg>
<seg id="40">Latter only 11% of the voters settled, but 24% of the citizens that selected in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast to that the white that represented 76% of the voters settled, only 46% of the voters, that selected in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Naturally the democratic legislators and its followers opposed vigorously the dismissal of laws, that the registrations of the voters restrict.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several bill were blocked through the vetos of the democratic governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The general lawyer of the USA interfered in order to stop the most disputed laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">They partially were able to limit the damages.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example only 16 of the 34 states of laws dismissed, that demand the showing of a photo identification card.</seg>
<seg id="47">To be sure the newly introduced rules in 2012 will impede undoubtedly the execution of the right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the dismissed laws and see the influence of the results in that in them as a clear goal for 2012 decisive countries.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Brennan of center of 2011 shows that those countries that dismissed these laws to win 171 of the 270 voices settle, that are required in the delegate group, around the presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early in order to confirm with certainty that these changes of the legal specifications will have at the choice system considerable effects on the result of the presidential elections in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one is certain: these new determinations will affect negatively the voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures undermine partially the democratic system of the USA.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Should prostate cancer early recognition: the test be made or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The PSA test wise results defective in the deed sometimes up, with incorrect negative or however also incorrect positive results, that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="3">This leads to stronger hesitation of the already irresolute men for the execution of early recognition tests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Should the test be made or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We overtook the opinion of two specialty physicians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the studies carried out in the USA, numerous disruptive influences between the control groups existed so that it is difficult to interpret these data and to give unambiguous recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">A further study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference exists in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study showed also that in an after observation after 12 years the probability of the development of metastases is 30 to 40% higher around, if no early recognition was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore I recommend the test from an age of 50 years and/or 40 years if one has a direct relative, who had become ill already with prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">With men of afro American origin, a higher risk exists also.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The most important is, to make the correct decision as soon as a cancer disease was recognized.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are cancer types, that aggressively and other that are indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The size of the risk of its cancer disease really intelligibly must be made the patient in that it the possible options are shown, with which Prostatakrebse untreated can remain, if he does not impair the quality of life in the long run, and decides one in these cases sooner on an active supervision of the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today takes place at many men, with whom one recognized cancer, no treatment because its cancer is not aggressively and represents no threat for its life.</seg>
<seg id="15">One proposes them an active supervision and offers in advancing of the illness a treatment to them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One certainly with increasing accuracy the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore I recommend nevertheless the execution of the test.</seg>
<seg id="18">Most importantly it is not however, to speak with its physician, in order to determine whether he should be carried out or.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In collaboration with the international company for Urologie, Movember developed an instrument, with which it is possible to value the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document (presently only in English, but a translation becomes briefly available be) can be downloaded under following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Preventing of the illness</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately there is no miracle means to the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">In spite of the progress in the research, the acceptance of a healthy way of life remains the best way in order to diminish the risk, to become ill with it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is appreciated that 30% of the cancer diseases could be prevented, if everyone would eat well and would move sufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If it no more smoker would give, would become this value at least on 50% increase", emphasizes André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer company.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To be sure is assumed that about 10% of the cancer diseases are caused by transmission.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several remain also totally unexplained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the Canadian cancer company, the battle against the tobacco dependence remains a priority, in spite of the decline of the number of the smoker.</seg>
<seg id="29">The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is also a risk factor for several other cancer types.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The health of the people damages strongly.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today yet gives it in Quebec 1.5 million of smoker", regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging data: 10 years after the renunciation of the cigarette to die diminished itself the risk at cancer around the half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In accordance with the Canadian cancer company, excess weight and Adipositas promote also the outbreak of the illness.</seg>
<seg id="36">They seem to increase the risk for breast, Grimmdarm-, rectum cancer, esophagus cancer, pancreas cancer and uterus cancer.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows, that a regular physical activity during the entire life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects", joins it thereto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The nourishment</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization recommends also to limit the consumption of red meat.</seg>
<seg id="40">In to large quantity it increases the risk to become ill with a Grimm- and/or mast intenstinal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="41">Sausage products should be avoided also.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of meat through smoking, drying or salts can lead to the development of carcinogenic.</seg>
<seg id="43">"Latter can the somatic cells damage and to the development of cancer lead", explains it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the last years, several scientists examined the context between vitamin additions and cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Your investigations are however presently not conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">After the Canadian cancer company, the studies to vitamin E are contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">While a study found out the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed sooner an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was shown also not yet clearly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In addition Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is, to speak with its physician over its objections and its informal encumbrance.</seg>
<seg id="51">"The execution of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer".</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs Boson analyzes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs Bosons excited a certain sensation in the last summer, and this for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">One believes in the deed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than at the mechanism, that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="4">And in the end it concerns observed became the last particle, whose existence of the standard model - our best or "at the least incorrect" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but empirically not yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physicists, it is not certain yet complete that it concerns really the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it strongly resembles the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition this seems confirmed through new data to become, that were introduced in this week on a large physics congress in Kyoto, but yet data are missing in order to be certain about that perfect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Let's assume nevertheless that it concerns actually the Higgs, because apparently only a slight risk exists to be mistaken, and let's regard us, around which it goes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is in this world an inevitably indispensable law that causes, that two objects cannot be simultaneous at the same place available.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not possible to violated this rule - and do not try it too strongly because you will hurt yourself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">For even if particle physics is a really strange world, turns out that for it also such a law counts: the Pauli' sche from end principle that purports, that two particles cannot occupy the same room to the same time, if they are in the same "quantum condition", whereby this "condition" consists in the large and entire of some of its characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefrom outgoing the physicists divide the particles in two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a corner, the good citizens, who are designated as a Fermione and obey good the Pauli principle, are.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in the other, the Bosonen, a vile volume of anarchist move is holy, which nothing - in any case not this principle what means, that they can be in the deed to the same time at the same place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These Bosonen subdivide itself in accordance with the web page The Particle Advent original of the Berkeley laboratories (that by the way absolutely astonishingly is) in two groups: the Mesonen that we will not treat here and the "power particles", through which the large powers of nature spread and with which the Higgs Boson would be used somehow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It must be emphasized here however that these Bosonen are not all so exotic creatures, how one could mean.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you are in a position to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a Bosons of extraordinary banality: the Photon or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic power.</seg>
<seg id="18">If namely a particle with an electric load accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field becomes "disturbed" exactly at this place, in about like a pebble stone, that was thrown into a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">Through this "interference", an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared radiation or ultraviolet radiation etc.) emerges, and this wave is nothing but a Photon and therefore one of the Bosonen "carriers of the power".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More stable field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Same applies to the Higgs Boson, with which difference that another field, that must "disturbed" become Higgs field, appears, so that this Boson.</seg>
<seg id="22">To be sure the Higgs field is very much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a few comparably with a frozen pond, whose surface could become only of a very large rock furrowed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore a gigantic particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! To reach - around such energies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in order to explain the relation between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">All particles are not in the deed and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, like Magnete, this do, but other not - for example a piece of paper never would become of even at the refrigerator hold.</seg>
<seg id="27">And likewise all particles with the Higgs field do not interact possess: that that do it, a mass while the other (like by the way the Photon) possess no mass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For what do all these researches can now "be good", asks woman Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For the science, they serve the examination of the standard model (SM), and they enable the physicists also to examine all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM exactly.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are by the way numerous physicists who hope longingest, that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and some holes of the model could plug.</seg>
<seg id="31">One must say that latter yet large deficiencies shows, because it no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter offers, that ca. 80% of matter of the universe forms (again ups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">To be sure such deviations were not found in the CERN until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Effects</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The effects of these researches for the general population are to be predicted more hard, but it could be supposed incorrectly that there would be none.</seg>
<seg id="35">By the way: in the early '60's the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not assume that its works such a revolution would release.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific applications, but nothing else further.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the deed developed already said the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - that in the Bell live worked has, in which the laser in the '1960's invented became, and that 1962 itself the first duration stroke laser (the first were gepulst) - to us that the laser was looked at at the beginning sooner than a "laboratory to be played".</seg>
<seg id="38">Stand before...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Moreover applications can result also from all the instruments, that surround the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example Willard Boyle 1969 developed again a small light sensor during its works in the optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor serves today all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and brought in it 2009 the Nobel Prize for physics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Naturally this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change inevitably our life, but means it, that one it really never know can...</seg>

<seg id="1">To die palliative care - the best way... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">With its from shot for "dying in would become" has Quebec recently the delicate question the end of life discusses.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must be received briefly again although a bill is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">To be sure yet much to do remains in this important subject area.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir tried to observe this more closely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived yet alone in its dwelling in the Montérégie.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate cancer that consumed it had let it a time period of two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">"You gave me five years to live, I have seven years created", said it half-hearted, in its bed in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil lying, in which it had arrived on the day before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"To be sure is it always a shock, on that can one not prepared be", says it.</seg>
<seg id="10">The illness makes its work: an immense weakness prevents it on that, however to go on the toilet and to eat even even.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the table before a delicious lunch sitting, willigt he resigns on to be helped in the meal.</seg>
<seg id="12">Courageous it succeeds to smile it even and bring offer to speak with the strange, that are busied around it around, its medicines, and it a bath to it.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the usual death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My largest wish is it, that one my diarrhea heals, because this humbling is", divides it with.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later the team found a remedy for this evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our life learn we, that a man in the standing pees", tells Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home Victor Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">To return into the childhood phase an unacceptable humiliation is for certain people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"That hangs of the capacity of the person from" to accept a setback, places it firmly.</seg>
<seg id="19">For in the opinion of several people that work in the palliative care, large events take place in the middle of this setback.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients, who are instructed into the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, suffer all from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">They have a maximal life expectancy of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">In this stage, they will bombard of the physicians and nurse, who attend to it, no longer with so named "healing" cares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For woman A., 89 years,, the worst fear is, to die "deliberately and through asphyxiation".</seg>
<seg id="24">But through the illness, I have really know learned my children.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children", joins it thereto.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have no more wishes in life", says it before it accepts, that one mounts it a costume, that helps its in the breathing.</seg>
<seg id="27">It expects in the next days nevertheless another last visit of its son that comes from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the home Victor Gadbois, one offers body care and aid position with a group of volunteer in the nourishment reception.</seg>
<seg id="29">The palliative care is used then if it gives no more other possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to form the dying more comfortably.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec, a bed comes on 11,700 inhabitants for the palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is very few if one are considered, that we will die one day everyone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here life is continued under optimum conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Both on plain of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">One grants the dying according to wish a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.</seg>
<seg id="36">The diabetics must control its blood-sugar level no longer.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is part of the everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">We served yesterday evening Mr. X a beer, that died in the course of the night.</seg>
<seg id="39">Today morning will be finish son the beer on foot the deceased.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help member and patients likewise", reports care director Nathalie Savard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the home Victor Gadbois, no day is such as the other.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is supported well of its pillows, while one activates to its honors, dies a young man of 36 years, that is surrounded by his parents, his wife and both small children, in tragic manner after he tried everything in order to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"Since six months are three to five beds always with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years covers", divides disturbs Dr. Christiane Martel with.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the patient instructed into the home Victor Gadbois come come by its accustomed site, 47% out of the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of the access to the palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">One says, have, i.e. to a care, that 77% of the Canadians no access to the palliative care, that should mitigate the suffering of patients, if latter the final stage of its life reached, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organizations, like the home Victor Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative care in the greater Montreal area specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Exactly this large insufficiency in the health provision of Quebec provides that several physicians specialized in the palliative care of the dismissal of a law to the regulation by medically assisted suicide and assisted suicide with objection expect.</seg>
<seg id="49">For the month of October a manifesto in the circulation, that of prominent personalities of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe became signs, has been in order to manifest its contradiction to such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="50">Dr. according to Christiane Martel the health system of Quebec is not efficient enough in order to guarantee that all rights have on a qualitatively high-value palliative care, before one accepts to pass over to the medically assisted suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, says it, I saw a patient, who was 14 days with large pain in the emergency ward, without that one seized measures to its relief.</seg>
<seg id="52">I fear that the patients want to die only therefore, because they receive no appropriate health provision.</seg>
<seg id="53">And simultaneously several oncologists treat stifled its patients in spite of worst prognoses to the last day.</seg>
<seg id="54">The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when it interrupted an onerous chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="55">When I announced my Onkologin, that I will interrupt the treatment, it answered me that it would regret, that I abandon the battle, told it.</seg>
<seg id="56">To be sure it had said to me that I would be at the end!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No omnipotente care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients to die asked have, that, that care personnel thank, that it did not grant this wish, after its pains were mitigated of a team of the palliative care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">It must be said however clearly that the palliative care is not in the pain treatment omnipotent.</seg>
<seg id="60">After Elsie Monereau, leader of the palliative care of the company the domestic palliative care of the greater Montreal area do not address 8% of the patients on a pain treatment.</seg>
<seg id="61">Entirely at the end of life, the physicians fall back therefore frequently on the terminale sedation, that runs out on that to put to sleep the patient either sporadic or durably until at the time its death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We cannot do more long so as if we do not perceive this side of the suffering.</seg>
<seg id="63">Patients without pain relief will have always more frequently the possibility to fall back on this terminale sedation.</seg>
<seg id="64">Patients whose pains are not mitigated say all the same sentence: "I want to die".</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not mean inevitably, "I wants, that you me put to sleep", but rather "I would like that my pains become" mitigated.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"It is remarkable, how the system decomposes, since one drastic measures seized has", quips Jacques Duchesneau, delegate in Quebec and former leader of the police of Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The scandal was uncovered through it based on a detailed investigation of the embezzlement in the context with the contracts to street structural work in Quebec, with which the at that time prime minister had agreed only reluctant.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Duchesneau report" established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of official.</seg>

<seg id="9">A 2011 established, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The 2011 established, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit undertakes also large exertions with its troops at accountants, determining and analyst of the government.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover the policemen of the "Marteau troop" who caused since 2009 that the "sewer system cartel" of Montreal in the artificial distension of the contracts more reserved advances...</seg>
<seg id="12">In that, it last week undertook in rows house searches and raised accusation because of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate carriers such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, that mayor of a suburb is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, that just of its office as a mayor of Laval, who resigned third largest cities of Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is suspected to have accepted in the exchange for public orders repeatedly bribes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Specifically accused became engineer the street department of building and inspection of Montreal by the way, as well as entrepreneur Italian origin, like Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">More latter sensation excited in that it declared the functional method of the "system" of orders public to be the receipt to the commission.</seg>
<seg id="17">He himself paid several years long 3% of the value of the contracts preserved in Montreal at a mediator standing with the mafia in connection, that transmitted the money at the union to Montreal, the party by mayor Gérald Tremblay.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Zambito had in the '2000's everywhere its hand in the game in that he more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (ca. 68,000 Euro) at province parties gave, been above all at that at that time at the power liberal.</seg>
<seg id="19">It confessed also to have organized an illegal means procurement for the former liberal vice president Nathalie Normandeau.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Sewer system contracts whose costs artificially were swelled of it</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In Montreal, the "system" of the corruption functioned smooth.</seg>
<seg id="22">The former building engineer Gilles Surprenant described this before the commission in detail: in ten years, he received restaurants and ice hockey games of the building business of gifts, invitations to trips, gulf tournament,, as well as bribe in the amount of 736,000 dollars as a return service for sewer system contracts whose costs he artificially swelled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Other officials of the street department of building and inspection admitted that they let grease itself, in that they swelled the calculations with incorrect additional achievements artificially around 30-40%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreover an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he overlooked intentionally a shadow household, that filled its cash registers with black money.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result of these uncovering, Mr. Tremblay beginning November resigned, what fell Montreal into a heavy crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Chantal Rouleau was one of the first delegates of Montreal, that raised the alarm.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a mayor of the city district Rivière-the-Prairies, in the East of the island, resisted further sells became itself it from 2010 against the sale of a community plot of land that for 5 million dollars acquired and for 1.6 million at building carrier in the booming real-estate market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">70% Black money in the choice campaigns</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Of the investigation, that is carried out in the end, it says that it pulls "at a thread, that enables it, the functional method the of ants infiltrated to understand system, in order to stop the evil and to denounce" the indebted.</seg>
<seg id="30">It says that the procedure would be "painful, but positive".</seg>
<seg id="31">We are there, to clean the wound, bräuchten to be sure an ascertainment unit certain only for Montreal, as well as a supervision in order to prevent a return of the doubtful practices.</seg>
<seg id="32">How one cleanly makes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regular.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Jacques Duchesneau notices in for its part that "official several hundreds of millions dollar stolen have", thinks however above all about the roll of that "mandate carrier, that over the tactic in the picture are" if they were not involved into the fraud!</seg>
<seg id="35">Come from a share of 70% black money in the financing of the choice campaign in Quebec it quips: Was said to "me that these would be" only a weak copy of the reality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The government of Quebec proposes to restrict the contributions at parties on 100 dollars, what would change it according to nothing at the situation: "As long as the campaign editions are not limited exertally, black money in the politics in the circulation will be".</seg>
<seg id="37">It recommends a complete revision of the system of orders public for the award and the financing of the parties: "We not more deeply can fall; in that we go the things with courage on the reason, we can construct" the house on a more solid basis with more inspections and laws again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">If this story damages the international appearance of Quebec and that of Montreal, demands Mr. Duchesneau of that up, that laugh about that to throw a view into its own backyard...</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is not the FC Barcelona"!</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season, you supposed a new size with PSG.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">One can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.</seg>
<seg id="5">Magnificent players came.</seg>
<seg id="6">Daily I make at its side of progress.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical personnel gave me also much.</seg>
<seg id="8">These elements spur me every day in addition on to improve my game level.</seg>
<seg id="9">And in a game, this is even simpler.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the soccer, all goes very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I do not break out in enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my beginning in the center of the preparing education of the INF Clairefontaine to my game time in Saint Etienne, I made always gradually progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">They take advantage of therefore the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...</seg>
<seg id="14">The new accesses of this in the summer are accustomed on that to expedite games of level very high.</seg>
<seg id="15">They know also that each training unit is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads in addition that a player such as I who must offer forehead and wants to give be best.</seg>
<seg id="17">By the way gives me Carlo Ancelotti much with regard to my game position.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is supported of Co trainers such as Claude Makelele, played that on the same position like I.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Is Ancelotti the correct person for the task?</seg>
<seg id="20">Obvious.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti infuses all technicians respect.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ligue 1, there is presently no comparable person, and it is among the best trainers of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">It looks back on a rich experience and won many titles with esteemed societies.</seg>
<seg id="24">It had contact with large players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that it will win further titles in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January I led an encouraging conversation with it.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time I had recovered just of an injury series.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that it set in me is also an explanation for my achievements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think over the first part of the season of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the frontrunner.</seg>
<seg id="31">We lurk however in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One our most important goals is qualified us the champions League: we in this manner for the round of sixteen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the goal of the society in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to come as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on all is possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">To be sure we will have to have our little word against very good European teams a say.</seg>
<seg id="37">First of all we want to become first our group before postage so that we can expedite the return match of the round of sixteen than a home game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Can the PSG become a large European society on short visibility?</seg>
<seg id="39">It has already the budget for that...</seg>
<seg id="40">Around a large European society to become, must win Paris title and make itself long-termed a name.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is not today the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially the PSG gives itself the means so that this intention supposes concrete forms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Would it be a large fiasco to not to win the title in the Ligue 1 how this was in the last season the case?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">This would be natural a large disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year is far off long us it really at the heart, this title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season, we were thickly at it.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough, around the victory report therefrom.</seg>
<seg id="48">We concluded the season with a very strong achievement.</seg>
<seg id="49">We locked with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally one should be with 79 points master...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, that of Montpellier, obtained an even better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">I believe that this year is the correct.</seg>
<seg id="53">Also if the large teams such as Marseille struggle, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have the thing in addition to win it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">In consideration its, what is invests become and the players whom we have, it is normal that much is expected by us.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accept that perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="57">If we win to be sure in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and one finds still something, what one can reproach for us, that with security is somewhat frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One ask himself, what the people yet expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We never could win each weekend with 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We try to set up a game draft.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team builds up gradually.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the champions League, we proved strength.</seg>
<seg id="64">Do not observe Manchester city, a society of that since two seasons creates to qualify for the round of sixteen, and the editions also gigantic handled has!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">With regard to the invested sums, one believed you to the game recess with 15 points advantage!</seg>
<seg id="66">That is that our opponents and the French championship except respect would be let.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, that were not good in the last season, became of this new PSG "geboostet".</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we will be in the month of May the smiling victor and say ourselves that we won it in spite of all difficulties in the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems to be completely of the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic dependent.</seg>
<seg id="71">All the more better, that one speaks about a "Zlatan dependence".</seg>
<seg id="72">That is that Ibrahimovic high-performance is and shoots many gates.</seg>
<seg id="73">Therefore it came and proves it that it is the star of the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Where it played, it brought to the attention of that it is a magnificent player and a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the team, we both the player and the person respect.</seg>
<seg id="76">It respects also the people who surround it.</seg>
<seg id="77">What it performed, is really extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="78">This spornt the other on to improve its game level.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, that worldwide one of the best defenders is, enables it all other also to make progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?</seg>
<seg id="81">How a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">It lay me at the heart to participate in this EM.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately prevented me my injury on that to knock something game time out.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw there things, out of which I followed strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today it succeeds me to realize good games in the national team.</seg>
<seg id="86">This was since my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.</seg>
<seg id="87">Out of that, what happened in the Ukraine, we pulled our apprenticeship, and today we must put an exemplary behavior at the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Which opinion do you have to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the tip of the "Bleus"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">It reached very promising results.</seg>
<seg id="90">We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">The national trainer is strict, stands the players nearly and moves to the victory on.</seg>
<seg id="92">How it was also Laurent Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would like to engage no comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had reached its goal in that it had qualified us for the EM.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Does that represent at the 16th of October in Spain forced undecided (1:1) a prelude game?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game gave us confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Everyone supported everyone others.</seg>

<seg id="2">The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the base of central banks, identified transaction and handling charges between the participant.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition a political vision is tangible like so often in these technologies: the conviction that the current, of bank monopoly monetary system formed leads, to finance crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the deed, that of Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is certain invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (however in dollar, Euro etc. convertible) and a protocol for the exchange such as BitTorrent, that enables the direct exchange of files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With 15,000 computers in the network, already about 200,000 transactions were grasped.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as a contribution or as a currency.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 had peakd an of 30 dollars (23 Euro), he fell five months later on 2 dollars before he has himself today on approximately ten dollar recovered (the courses are on the web page bitcoincharts. com itemized).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing especially impressive in comparison with the international trade of real currencies or finance products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless the European central bank (EZB) in a report published in October showed interest on virtual currencies for this.</seg>
<seg id="10">It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the largest success", "in the competition with the dollar or Euro" and "similarly to to the conventional currencies".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs win or buy can of other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits", that are used in order to make headway in a video-game, that one through games (and sometimes also trade back).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook developed also such a system.</seg>
<seg id="13">To be sure the trade is controlled each time of a central authority and is processed.</seg>
<seg id="14">With Bitcoin, all network knots Verwahrer are simultaneous the calculation book, inspector, money Emittenten as well as buyer and salesman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network function?</seg>
<seg id="16">Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two e-mail addresses in form of an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the difference that the user can select another address for each payment, what guarantees the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A row of the data standing with this transaction in context is signed electronically by a double encoding system.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this manner the network can test the authenticity of the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="20">With the help of the contents of the file, it is to be guaranteed also possible that the acted Bitcoins in the calculation book common in the entire network of the public accounts are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The decisive step exists therein to register this new transaction into this book.</seg>
<seg id="22">This happens over a mathematical task, that is started on the computers whereby the winners, who is a type preliminary headquarters banker who possesses privilege, to add this additional line.</seg>
<seg id="23">It concerns a cutting up of the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The computers "take" the new transaction and join it a number thereto before the entire becomes "chops".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is the goal of finding that number, that yields a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">If this number was found, the other knots effortlessly can test whether it is the correct.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is connected therefore durably with the chain of all other transaction, and each modification would change the fingerprint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user wants to pay two times for deceiving very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one would be validated both transactions by the network and remains the other without connection because both different fingerprints possess.</seg>
<seg id="29">The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To the prevention of an inflation, this reward regularly is halved, probably before end 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Bitcoins present in the circulation are limited therefore to 21 million, but lets up to a hundred millionth divisible, what one certain latitude...</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition the difficulty of the task with every improvement of the computing power is increased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Life of the network had already heights and depths.</seg>
<seg id="34">The web pages that allocate services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin enclosures stolen.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The used weakness concerns not the actual protocol", assures Pierre Noizat, that just Paymium introduced, that is a business for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="36">The EZB reports also over the possibilities of the money wash with the help of this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">To be sure cash shows also these deficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="38">Important participants such as Wikipedia deny contributions of this type.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of other like the blog platform Word press, they are accepted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann institute in Israel analyzed and shown the calculation book that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November a "Mega sale" was started.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollar were exchanged", is happy Jon Holmquist that works for the business Coinabul, that converts Bitcoins in gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, that also author of a book is over this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.</seg>
<seg id="44">Its system Paytunia corresponds a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses however Bitcoin to the validation of the transaction that are through it cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition the proprietor administers its identity and can remain therefore anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The system easily can implement become at the dealers, and no new terminals or computer programs latter must install.</seg>
<seg id="47">They must indicate simply only an address, "photographs and recognized" will can that of a telephone, gives Pierre Noizat on, that assures, that it user cable would send has.</seg>
<seg id="48">A general trend is to be indicated it, with which hierarchical systems are roofed for the benefit of more strongly horizontally directed systems.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It becomes some time last, until itself Bitcoin puts through, but 2013 could a turning point be", predicts it.</seg>

<seg id="1">A constitution with the breach pole in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It concerns a new poker game of Präsident Mohammed Mursi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt remains ever split more with regard to the constitution explanation, that grants it temporarily the unlimited authority, then, it concluded to set all on a card.</seg>
<seg id="4">To the surprise all it announced on Wednesday that the verfassungsgebende meeting would dismiss its final frame at the next day.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before just a week, the country chief had granted this plenum two additional months for the conclusion of its works.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Egypt has relied now for almost two years on a preliminary, repeatedly altered text, what weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal disorder.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new initiative provided only for an even stronger split of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">For its opponents, the president in its persists "autocratic delirium" in that he breaks" further "its word and "the right with feet steps".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On sides of its advocates, one assures that it is a way to conclude the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within 14 days, a referendum should be held off.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period that forces the brothers in addition to forgo its intention, to declare the text section to be section to the egyptians.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the president, it is also a type and manner to regain its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages in the entire country.</seg>
<seg id="13">After affirmation in an interview with the American newsreels Times, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the egyptians will agree benevolent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially since the Egyptian people with this fall back rushed on one voting an ultimatum placed becomes: "Either agrees its for my design or I retain the unlimited authority", latter should come to after acceptance of the constitution supposedly an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">85 chiefly Islamist members of this verfassungsgebenden meeting dismissed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the liberals is not come later the request.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly before the constitution explanation in the middle of November they turned away itself because they are of the opinion, that they were not in a position to bring its visibility manner to bear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representative of human right organizations, religious minorities or the civil company likewise acted.</seg>
<seg id="19">To the accomplishment of the decision capacity, mornings in all became would hurry yesterday 11 people, deputy members, added.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some stand the moslem brothers very near.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprisingly that the articles unanimously were dismissed usually.</seg>
<seg id="22">The commentators found it by the way entertaining that the single difference of opinion of the day came... in the time for the prayer to the expression, because some members of the group of the opinion were, that the pendulum clock of the verfassungsgebenden meeting did not go exactly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The texts that yet was dismissed yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Articles 2 that stretched all attention on remains in the end identically with that of the constitution of 1971 and purports that "the principles of the shariah are" the main source the to the right.</seg>
<seg id="25">To replace the salafistischen parties, for which the erection of the Islamic is to the right an important demand, had the hope, "the principles" by "the rules", what possible would have made a stricter application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists, the fact is that this article was not changed, a proof of its good will and for its respect vis-à-vis the other members of the Egyptian company.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Sanctimony" reciprocate the liberals that look at this only as a propaganda blow.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to for them the Islamisierung of the constitution takes place via other articles.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the same time they have especially articles 220 in mind, that the university al Azhar awards an advising function, especially with regard to the examination of the conformity with the laws of the shariah.</seg>
<seg id="30">Loud the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier this is disturbing because "the people who are requested to an attitude were not selected, and possess no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">One can see herein the first signs of a Theokratie".</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the liberals are nourished moreover of the fact that the next chancellor of this university might be moderated by far less as the present.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Presently no concrete religious engagement is to be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this constitution, we remain in the frame of the middle class country.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most lawyers who worked at this text are no Ulema, but rather academician, that in part in the French system instructed become are", soothes Alexis Blouet, that a doctoral dissertation writes over the Egyptian constitution transit ions.</seg>
<seg id="36">It clears however, "that with regard to the articles 220 an ambiguity exist can, because the related concepts are borrowed the religious vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="37">One has reference here especially to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisdiction, Anm d. speech.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide about that".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Next to its religious aspect, the text dismissed yesterday is criticized strongly based on the long-range authorities, that it grants the president of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="40">The moslem brothers argue that these are compared reduced to the former regime clearly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">A further issue: the authorities of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the harmony with the wish of the military, the test of the defense household is not produced the parliament, but rather a national defense advice.</seg>
<seg id="43">Just as there will be no ban of civil action in courts martial how it demanded the unions to the defense of the human rights.</seg>
<seg id="44">Latter its fears announce also with regard to the text, that they look at as a freiheitsbedrohend.</seg>
<seg id="45">The state of affairs of the blasphemy is maintained, and offenses are forbidden now, what could be right serious consequences for the on freedom of speech, especially for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition no more article has reference to the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef of Watch humane Rights.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to your opinion the single positive point is the ban of the torture through articles 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was not contained in the prior constitution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian president yesterday evening must itself on television external, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">While delegate and Bürgerrechtler discuss about that, which utility brings the law over binding jumping it for migrants, criminal act already with falsified certificates</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Annually 13 million foreign workers to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia come.</seg>
<seg id="4">That of them are the citizens of the headquarters Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is the your single goal to earn money for the support of the families remaining in the homeland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On the 1st of December, a law stepped effective, that according to every work migrant a test, that certifies knowledge of the Russian language, discard must.</seg>
<seg id="7">Previously this regulation applies only to migrants, whom in the service sector, in which municipal dwelling economy want to work and in the retail trade.</seg>
<seg id="8">However the tests should become gradually according to federal migration authority future for all foreign workers the duty.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time one must discard not only jumping it, but rather also tests into the Russian story and the bases of the legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Must knowledge of language both proved become for the receipt and the extension of the work permit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exceptions apply only to citizen of countries, in whom Russian is office language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also of this law excluded are people who have receive its education testimonies and diploma before the ruin the Ussr in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Sense, problematic nature and protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The entirety of the test places becomes language under the Ägide of the Puschkin institute for the Russian, that Russian university of the friendship among nations, that moscovite of nationals university, that saint Peter castle of nationals stand university and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">The migrants can discard the tests in all cities; already now already more were opened in Russia than 160 corresponding centers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The initiative to the introduction of the tests was supported of the delegates of the Staatsduma and the federal migration authority.</seg>
<seg id="17">Bürgerrechtler on the other hand asked question following in the press repeatedly before the taking effect of the law: What does that bring very actually?</seg>
<seg id="18">Which variations does the direction bring to have to show knowledge of language, both for the Russians and for the foreign workers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Above all, reply speaker of the migration authority, would go it therefore to diminish the number of the slave laborers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Many speak now over the protection of the rights of work migrants", says the leader of the representation of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.</seg>
<seg id="21">Your rights must be protected however already against its departure.</seg>
<seg id="22">Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.</seg>
<seg id="23">On problems, migrants knock without occupation, development, knowledge of language and medical examination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant will meet without knowledge of language inevitably people with evil intentions, who stick it under the pretext of aid into some dark, narrow barracks, where he from will await with dozens his equal months without meal and documents and 12 to 14 hours will work at the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Many troubles of our migrants reach us.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In the homeland becomes you the one promised, and in the arrival become you deceived, get its passports decreased and receive not the promised wage", confirms the leader of the central administration for work migration of the tadschikischen migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do not scold, boss!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless many citizens of the centrally Asian republics, who want to earn its money in Russia, admit, that they do not control not only the language of the goal country, but rather can express itself also in its own language hardly in writing.</seg>
<seg id="29">That is natural not so very its guilt when rather the evil: Only A FEW Turkmenen, Usbeken and Tadschiken can afford also only a sensible reason education.</seg>
<seg id="30">For in its families, it does not give yet once money in order to nourish the children, let alone, them respectable clothing to buy shoes and school things.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a teenager, these children seize then at once the first opportunity to the Geldverdienen.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It is difficult without knowledge of language", admit it.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel lowers you and inferiorly".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Bürgerrechtler emphasize following important aspect regarding the law.</seg>
<seg id="35">Only migrants with legal status must discard the test.</seg>
<seg id="36">Do not have this status, gives it no test and consequently no official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime the large part of the foreign workers stays further illegally in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Sincerely welcome" or "access for unauthorized forbidden"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many migrants confirm that it is not simple to receive in Russia an official status.</seg>
<seg id="40">Bureaucratic hurdles are the reason and natural the linguistic difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">Moreover costs the legalizations moneys: 12 to 16 thousands rouble.</seg>
<seg id="42">One can make a falsified registration quickly and solely for one and a half thousands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The colleagues of the Russian police know that our documents are falsified chiefly and we are not registered, and from that cases of extortion emerge then.</seg>
<seg id="44">"You want on or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea", expresses itself the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow vis-à-vis journalists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Shun" "merely no costs for incorrect papers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Already at the day, at which the law stepped effective turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be falsified.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some falsified certificates, that certify the completion of the jumping it, became fitting taken already of colleagues of the federal migration authority.</seg>
<seg id="48">The falsified papers were printed with an usual color printer.</seg>
<seg id="49">Naturally the new owners received this not for nothing: To be able to save every migrant who hoped, itself so the tests, paid documents seven thousand for that rouble.</seg>
<seg id="50">That is more than twice as much like the costs for the official test: This costs a work migrant three thousand roubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">About the fact that the most important direct task exists therein of protecting the system against corruption so that the certifications cannot be bought simply, are itself both office carrier and Bürgerrechtler united.</seg>
<seg id="52">For the moment, the authorities only can promise foreign workers, who fall in the first time through the test, that they receive time for a language mean course.</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition newcomers are offered without knowledge of language places in areas, in which no active understanding with people is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="6">The chairperson of the Duma committee on security and corruption fight, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised the suggestion that the changes are produced at the weapon law briefly the Duma.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Everyone is not therewith satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems through "attraction of the screws".</seg>
<seg id="8">On the Internet an open letter was published, whose authors - representative of different weapon associations - demand by the authorities, to take by "senseless intensification" distance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very slight, expressed the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, to the Russian service of the BBC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes with application of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012 were committed while for the same period altogether 1,168 thousands offense were indicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are convinced that an intensification of the law will hold off for private possession of firearms criminal not therefrom to make use of on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently one can find according to the authors in Moscow each possible weapon for little money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the meantime the Ministry of the Interior emphasizes that the distribution of illegal weapons is under control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Suppliers: from the factories to the officers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The weapons arrive over several canals on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="16">There are five such head canals, tells a colonel Viktor Baranez former that ten years in the development ministry and in the general staff was active.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screenshot of a web page that supposes weapon orders</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first canal is the army and/or the military, i.e. weapons, that were stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The weapons became both of the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern itself stolen", says Baranez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">On the second canal, illegal weapons that are stolen custodians of the law by criminal come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranez clarifies that to this weapons count, that were stolen both out of the armories of the police and direct by colleagues of the punishment pursuit authorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Further illegally sold weapons come from military weapon warehouses.</seg>
<seg id="23">In many military warehouses, it came frequently to explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It gives proofs, that it itself in some cases around arson was, around the lack about weapons to gloss over", says the former military member.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">A contribution to the black market also the weapon manufacturers perform in accordance with Baranez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Nowadays gives it innumerable private armament factories, that the international competition do not withstand and therefore the weapons under the hand on the black market, about in Moscow, dissipate", reports the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">A further canal of the black market is the smuggling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Especially many pistols and weapons come out of poor countries such as Kirgisien.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There gives it an own production skilled-labor sometimes as well as a mafia, that the smuggling organizes", clarifies the former military member.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">From where do the weapons come?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts calculated, which share everyone approximately has the five canals at the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2011, a report was composed of the center for problem analyses and national administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Report of analyzed the experts the Ministry of the Interior and the federal service for national statistics, kriminologische literature and publicly accessible data on portal to the subject of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The predominant part of the illegal weapons comes according to the investigators of the army and the legal insurance authorities.</seg>
<seg id="35">The half of all weapons on the black market would be there through that "guilt of responsible, that in its work with weapons to do have arrived", is named it in the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The data of the researchers according to come go coming 17% of the weapons from conflict zone, 14% on thefts in the weapon production back, and 5% out of illegal excavations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">A sale adviser of a weapon store who does not want to be named nominally assures that weapons that are found in illegal excavations, already long no one buys more, because they become obsolete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">According to it it is more frequent that dealers obtain the supply in a weapon warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="39">Over a Fähnrich, a weapon, for example a pistol of the type TT becomes, bought.</seg>
<seg id="40">The weapon is issued and is delivered by the fence.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The dealer brings the weapon into the city and sells it there for 900 Euro per piece with two magazines", tells he</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The police knows naturally over all and leads therefore, if it the plan to the disclosure of crime do not keep can, periodically control purchases with dealers through, the illegal weapon offer", joins the sale adviser thereto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"Like in the luxury store"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Buyer and salesman find most frequently over acquaintance together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I had looked at web pages and blogs when someone became on me attentively and me proposed to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait on me, that me at one certain place would bring where we could negotiate then the price.</seg>
<seg id="46">I learned the price for the weapon first there</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Military commentator Viktor Baranez</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"Around a weapon to provide, require I an acquaintance, the contacts has", tells the sale adviser. "I have such an acquaintance, but I do not trust" to it.</seg>
<seg id="49">There is dealer on the markets, but there one must go and make arrangements with a code like "of Iwan Iwanowitsch, that lets align, that the daughter has" lost a tooth.</seg>
<seg id="50">I come presently even at some blow rings over an acquaintance, to whom I trust.</seg>
<seg id="51">It delivers the blow rings also only therefore because it knows, to me that I it not verpfeife.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Novices search for weapons on different ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former military member Viktor Baranez tried itself middle of the 1990 as a buyer of illegal weapons when he wrote an article to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="54">The schemes did not change according to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">It got a photo album in which "all possible" was portrayed.</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt me like in the luxury store", remembers the military member.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer does not get the cat in the sack according to Baranez, but rather everything can try.</seg>
<seg id="58">I as a potential customer would not buy up would go place simply only, but rather with the salesman into the forest, and there we a target.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I then there can shoot, and if I therefrom convinces am, that the weapon a good shot has, negotiate we together", describes the expert the action.</seg>

<seg id="72">The responsibles suppose the orders.</seg>
<seg id="73">The buyer transfers the money over a bank vending machine.</seg>
<seg id="74">"As an answer receives it a photo and a description of the ambush of the weapon", reports the press officer of the public-spirited organization "Pravo well oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the USA, almost Food and supermarket employed strike</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every fourth US American youth sits sometime behind the cash register of Mc Donald's it</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the past days, it came everywhere it in the USA to massive protests against low wages in branch of Walmart and restaurants of popular almost-Food-chains such as Mc Donald's, castle King, Taco Bell, Wendy's it and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Yet no one can predict whether the protests will swell yet further or whether them already soon again the air goes out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protests are supported of labor unions and several to the left arranged public-spirited organizations.</seg>
<seg id="6">Next to the increase of the modest wages of simple Walmart- and almost-Food-employed, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing labor unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Previously this industry of the economy is organized hardly unionist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 cents per year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began looked past week after Thanksgiving, at the so-called Friday, at which in the USA clearance sales took place, that lured millions of customers, what led sometimes to melee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">This day some Walmart colleagues of whom it gives worldwide 2.2 million laid down, its work and bestreikten together with labor unions and left activists branch of the chain whose target group are people of low and middle income.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells all products, of diaper over hunt weapons and car batteries up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The good in the Walmart branches is on average between 8 and 27% more favorable than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore many of the negligibly paid Walmart employed shop only at the own job.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prices and the its assortment made Walmart to one of the largest businesses in the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">According to critics Walmart so favorably can sell the good often only therefore because the colleagues badly are paid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Latter complain also about heavy work conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Friday" "looked demanded the participants of the protests at that raises and expressed its annoyance about the fact that the contribution had climbed for the betriebseigene health insurance of 30 on 100 dollars per month.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Walmart colleague, who earns 9.5 U.S. dollars of the hour, could not afford this increase, said it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Researchers out of the Californian university in Berkeley cover that, if the business raises the average wage to 12 dollars the hour, it Walmart 3.2 billions of dollar cost would become.</seg>
<seg id="20">Those are ca. Contribute 1.1% more than it now for wage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">If Walmart would transfer to the raises completely the customers, every purchase cost it in the future only 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">Per year, additional expenditures of only 12.39 dollars would be that for it in comparison with today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Advocates of Walmart assess satisfied that it came only in nine states to protests and this the business no losses at all of given.</seg>
<seg id="24">That looked lasted Friday into its store of 8 o'clock evenings on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period, Walmart sold approximately 5000 articles per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">Altogether the Walmart cash registers carried out "looked at that Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The speaker of the business, served Fogelman, maintained in an interview on the web page of the to the left arranged Huffington postal service that altogether "less than five" Walmart colleagues laid down the work and the protest action had been solely "a further PR trick" of the labor union that organized the protests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free cash register"!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests went on this week in New York where its goal were not however Walmart branch (that in this progressive city not desired and therefore are previously non-existent), but rather McDonald's it and other bargain restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's it says, the business would sell billions of portion, and nevertheless one grants you no sick days, and you are not paid for your honest works!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, member of the New York city advice</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Presently the minimum wage is in accordance with more federally and New York legislation about 7.25 dollars the hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">In almost-Food-restaurants, the minimum wage is not raised got gradually, to be sure too strongly, and in the average its simple colleague in New York 8.90 U.S. dollar of the hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one earns less than it in this expensive city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How it is possible to come out in New York with so little money, is me inconceivable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was once a time, in which almost one-quarter of all US American youths stood after the school in McDonald's it behind the counter, to be sure the youths lived yet at its parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hardly one saw therein the head source of income or planned to remain more long there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now meet me in interviews with colleagues of McDonald's it permanently people who lament himself, that they must come out with this wage and must nourish sometimes even its children.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand there is notices in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal a commentary, whose author in to get it would be irresponsible, children if one would not know, how one should nourish it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protests, who began on Thursday it around 6.30 clock mornings before the McDonald's in the 40th streets and in the Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of almost-Food-restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 U.S. dollars of the hour, what corresponds than a doubling of the present minimum wage to more.</seg>
<seg id="40">They demanded further the development of labor unions in the almost-Food-industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The US American law forbids it the business management to stand this goal in the way and to admonish or to release labor union members.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand the business management does not make it them simply.</seg>
<seg id="43">The foundation of labor unions in the almost-Food-industry is difficult however also for objective reasons.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most important reason is the high personnel turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Discontented</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">There were loud protests this day also before many other almost-Food-restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The highpoint of the protests was a meeting at the noon before the McDonald's it at the Times Square, with which some local democrats spoke, under that city councilor Jumaane Williams that said: "McDonald's it says, it would sell billions of portion, and nevertheless one grants you no sick days, and you are not paid" for your honest works!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators were supported also of other prominent New York democrat, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio that said, that "we the almost-Food-colleagues should support jointly so that they can receive a just wage and can reach the economic prosperity, that of every New York earns"!.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">According to New York, Times was this the largest action of its type in the story of the US American almost-Food-industry.</seg>
<seg id="50">However only several hundred were people on the spot, of which by far all in the almost-Food-industry are not busied, in which in New York ten thousands work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Yet is not to be seen whether the radios of these protests measures entire will mobilize.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The brain lets previously only moderate overburden" itself</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The technologies modern with followers popular subject of the expanded reality is perceived recently for usually by the lens of some special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="3">First Google in the summer presented became a functioning model in its annual conference, in November then well known that also Microsoft had registered a corresponding patent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, become to be sure clear that the glasses was for the scientists of the business only a run station.</seg>
<seg id="5">It excites the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Describing you please shortly, which researches your group operates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We busy us with the interaction of person and machine, want to expand at the same time however the boundaries of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Previously humanity is stick remained chiefly in the phase, in which with pixel on flat screens worked becomes, that are touched sometimes also.</seg>
<seg id="9">We however 5-10 years want to look ahead and want to anticipate the radical variations of this interaction.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are is sold a progress, and nowadays no more Xbox without Kinect because all are interested in movement control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What expects us yet in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although Kinect brought the interaction on a physical plain, much plays itself yet on the flat screen off, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The petition of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the edition previously not yet decisively.</seg>
<seg id="14">We try to change that, work at real three-dimensional representation systems on the basis of different technologies, under that projection.</seg>
<seg id="15">We must release the world of computers into our physical world and more tangibly must make it.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition it is however required that not only the user is recognized, but rather also its environment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we could supplement the real world much more simply through virtual objects.</seg>
<seg id="18">And first of all we should become these bescheuerten Virtual-Reality-helmets loose!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think over language control?</seg>
<seg id="20">Is you chosen, but it not is overvalued?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- You are not certain the all-purpose solution because it raises questions to the privacy, because one would not like to inform always all next about its actions and intentions.</seg>
<seg id="22">Each type of interaction with computers is actual good, to be sure each in its certain niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example we worked in the area of the control of objects on public places at a project, with which we experimented with short and tight, instead of with unloading gestures.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time the gestures were not recorded of the object camera, but rather of a bracelet, that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.</seg>
<seg id="25">Yet it is relatively large, could reduce become theoretically however on the size of a watch.</seg>
<seg id="26">But altogether the future belongs to be sure, for example gestures and language to mixed control types.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- Like that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Would - we you ask me for example to pass this soda can to you?</seg>
<seg id="29">They say it and point simultaneously on that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Normally I say it simply only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, that could be recognized very heavily.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Does - that not be named want, you that the user adapts himself to that, what can perform a machine to the respective moment, and what?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Unconditionally, but it does not concern here a mutual approach.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that we work will must in the near future above all at the development of new sensor types, that enable it to grasp reactions of people more exactly.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example laser sensors can be that because they offer in the depth a good solution, what is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- Which claims place you coming from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors at modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">Does it lack at solution, depth or something else other?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- The present generation is in the reason a good starting point for our work in the area of the three-dimensional recognition.</seg>
<seg id="39">Natural 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.</seg>
<seg id="40">Yet the essential matter the megapixels themselves are not, but rather the quality of the matrix and the depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">So seen are all present technologies for us not good enough because the developers the algorithms have more work.</seg>
<seg id="42">Not only the solution must be considered along the X and the Y-, but rather also along the Z axis.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the speed and the amount of the pictures per second are important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The movements of the person are said extremely dynamically and openly, are the present 30 fps especially for gestures too little.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor with a controllable processing delay between 1 to 100 millisecond in our laboratory in speech moon whereby the current commercial sensors lie (60 to 100) more closely at the second value.</seg>
<seg id="46">Do not understand everyone how very that influences the interaction of person and machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">For my work, I needed exactly so a device, only without contact control and with more pictures per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Would - the amount of the cameras not have to be increased?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- Kinect works presently with three "cameras" whereby one of them is actual an infrared transmitter and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is actual an usual RGB camera.</seg>
<seg id="51">It does not serve to the calculation of the object depth.</seg>
<seg id="52">More cameras could solve possibly the problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Reinforce or the problem because more calculations would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">A flexible, Kinect similar system, with which we could play with different camera inclinations, would be beautiful in order to assess how that helps us in the three-dimensional ascertainment of a position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I quite would remember, Microsoft did not present in contrast its glasses to Google the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the expanded reality in the everyday life the glasses the best outlooks has?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Natural it is not comfortable to hold underway always a Smartphone in the raised hand, but I think following: The craziest variant would be a "changing" expanded reality, with which we could shift over a Cloud of the glasses on the Smartphone</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses are a personal Gadget and therein its strength (private can only you see) lies prevents, but simultaneously also its weakness, for an expanded reality by means of glasses that you can work jointly with other at virtual objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Places we us a moment long before that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only Tony strongly out of Iron one, but rather also Normalsterblichen.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a problem, on which critics of this idea frequently refer: There is no perceptible reaction!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands sense generally nothing!</seg>
<seg id="62">Which answers does your group want to give on this objection?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my lectures I speak often therefrom that the expanded reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between person and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think, the eighth breakthrough could become thoroughly the integration of the tactile perception.</seg>
<seg id="65">An interesting method is presently the use of the second hand as something projection document unusual.</seg>
<seg id="66">It takes pressure excellently aware!</seg>
<seg id="67">There are however also technologies that are aligned actually on that to lend the "pictures in the air" something strong, for example produced the Interferenz of some arranged ultrasound rays in a certain point where the finger is, a feeling, that is momentarily however yet so weak, as someone blew over the hand bales.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also volumes for the wrist, that influence on the nerve ending in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Did - you try, overburden the brain to?</seg>
<seg id="70">Think let that it senses that, what should sense it, if it sees just something?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- That is a good idea, tried we it not yet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt. ru</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rosbalt continues the project "Peter castle vanguard", that is dedicated to city inhabitants, who form the vanguard of the art and culture.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the selected list, already high-ranking representatives of the Peter castle landed go taking place via art scene, whose the boundaries of the city out and find that often recognition in Europe without being well known in the remainder of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The entire city knows Kirill Miller that in red of clothed bearded, that one finds once museum in the Russian, once in the summer garden, once in scene meeting or on openings.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wherever the pictures by Kirill Miller also issued become, attract it large crowds of people on.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is one of the typical Peter castle socially philosophical artist whom new myths create.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is an illuminating personality of the Peter castle vanguard end of the 80 and/or beginning of the 90.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is also a man of the city and does magic through its presence on the street its citizen a smile into the face and provides with them for good mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently he snatched himself a trick organ and became the Peter castle trick organ player, there he himself for this difficult roll with regard to its artist existence, its philosophy and be felt image finally ready.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- Kirill, why are you not actually always in red and for example in yellow or turquois in the city underway?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">I selected the color red as a fashion designer, who explains himself with the optics and the image.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image adviser and company.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the company, all evokes, what deviates something from the gray standard, aggressions and bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="15">I want to come however through my provocation with the people into the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of my past provocation was an invitation to the conversation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">- When do you know that you must become painter?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- In a display in the culture palace Newskij, with which my works were issued.</seg>
<seg id="19">I concept that I must go this way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then the time of the old free went, however painters not officially acknowledged were over at that time, and new and free painters how I incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="21">I friendly with the painters of the new generation, therefore with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from that emerged was me "Puschkinskaja 10", and then first once end.</seg>
<seg id="22">It pulls me to the theater, to the fashion, to the music, actually to all, except the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">- And all that united itself in your Art-Klinik.. - It was important to me to stand in the midpoint of the Peter castle culture where the best creating artists should meet themselves.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there there was a musically artistic club for the bohemian, the house of the Peter castle to the renovation works bohemian.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember me also how cord with its project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.</seg>
<seg id="26">Cord and its friends sang simple songs to the Play cheek, carried narrow tricots and to them belonged also the composer announced today Igor Wdowin.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the group began to play live, became out of its "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Dress mountain moderated many programs the time ago of "Halli Galli".</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them dress mountain, and it began its large career, but it learned the bases here.</seg>
<seg id="30">Also the gallery "D 137" or the club" Griboedov" have its origin in the kind of clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">There our colleagues and regular guests went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a hero of the past century when culture meant something else.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2000, there was in the press a survey with which it concerned the honor "personalities of our city".</seg>
<seg id="34">I won in the category "artist of the year", and therewith I had arrived at the highpoint.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not easy to work in new times after old rules; I am a person of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the current time, it is simple, famous to become, but culture and popularity are not the same: One can be famous without performing therewith a cultural contribution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">- Your works have an unmistakable style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- Real pearls are many of my pictures and express clearly the relevance and sharpness of the thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will have a display with the subject "the Russian museum as clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">I was earlier social, but now it hurts and prepares anxiety, to be.</seg>
<seg id="42">In a clown, that of all smudges and loses its tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love have the grotesque, and I grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">Let's rescue for example the world in that we prescribe, that every has to disguise itself completely.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now every pays attention to the clothing and orients itself towards the Äußeren and not at the interior of the person.</seg>
<seg id="46">But perhaps one may not give a person the hand, but rather should spit it into the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">The deceit disappears through the disguising.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Recently we saw you in the roll of the municipal trick organ player. - A culture city should have such a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, if not I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Can - also commercial art be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, respectful and flattering.</seg>
<seg id="52">We see the ruin of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Earlier the people formed large groups: The Bohemiens loved the one and the simple people the other.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now there is Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to pleased all.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am no one hundred-dollar-note that pleases everyone.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now you must consider, whom you will please.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now every cult star has approximately 100 followers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- To the entrances of Stas Michailow several thousands come however!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- To it left women come plays, there the sexually social sphere a role.</seg>
<seg id="60">For cultural reasons, 300 people and 10 thousands do not come, consequently there is less management, money, and everything goes to ruin.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have follower, and the most important is not, to deceive it and is to be destroyed the reached not.</seg>
<seg id="62">In my youth, I painted such pictures, that hung at a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.</seg>
<seg id="63">I began with pictures, that come normally first at the end of the career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is named: intellectual culture and consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">Consumption has generally no culture, that is somewhat entire other.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a person of the past culture and grew up rejected with artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty, and money in order to be able to paint.</seg>
<seg id="68">That is the culture that I advocate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Kirill, what does Petersburg be missing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- Goods culture experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">One says: Servant of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">Yet every of them cannot concern itself with culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the real czars, it was differently, for the czars understood perhaps much of culture, but they understood that correct experts are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow, there are presently good advisers.</seg>
<seg id="75">In Petersburg, we have is blocked which that could be experts, but them the way because it more high-ranking experts needs, who correctly value the first and clear them the way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now only the own taste counts.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same applies to the Erarta, however with the difference that they honestly say, that they don't have to suppose all contemporary art and some painters must seek themselves therefore other museums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">- What is Petersburg for you?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">- Petersburg is not the culture capital; in Moscow, there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">On our stones, art only heavily can grow up.</seg>
<seg id="81">We require a cultural breeding ground, for for example that have is we meanwhile more author than a reader, and yet not correct.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are many curious people who visit displays or concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">Here much are that fewer.</seg>
<seg id="84">Art must be again modern, so like to start of the previous century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is financed out of subsidies of the city Saint Petersburg</seg>

<seg id="5">Rescue in order to humanity, the important question stands how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">There are not many choices according to my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">De facto there are only two real planets that we at least hypothetically could inhabit.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Namely Mars and Venus", says the scientific colleague of the astronomical star mountain institute Wladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While however the conditions are comparatively life friendly on Mars, a temperature of 500 degrees rules on the surface of the Venus.</seg>
<seg id="10">Live would be only in large height or in the orbit of the Venus, therefore in that all, possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The question of the propagation in the all treated the researchers first of all with regard to the Flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already a half century before that experiments with plants were carried out.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fourth generation of the peas cultivated in the orbit did not differ in the slightest by the earthly types.</seg>
<seg id="14">It followed the breeding of insects, more exact of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, quail eggs were sent into the universe in order to investigate how the weightlessness affects the development of embryo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It develops an entirely normal chick.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yet then the problem begins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The problem insists therein, that the chick stop find must; it must on its legs stand can and begin, itself to move", clarifies the laboratory leader of the institute for medically biological problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without firm underground, the chicks flipped over wildly.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ten hours of late stumpften the instincts of the new-born completely off.</seg>
<seg id="21">The chicks did not react to light and sounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Four days later died it then simply.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Twice let we chick slip and placed that very then on, because it is simply impossible, there with them to work", holds Wladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in that all firmly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last brood cage with animals flew 16 years ago into the orbit.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring 2013, the experiments are continued.</seg>
<seg id="26">However only same sexual species will be on the organic satellite "Bion".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">There was an experiment with rats that became all sent already fertilized in that.</seg>
<seg id="28">Fundamentally was nothing assessed at the same time special.</seg>
<seg id="29">"That was straight with the organic satellites, but was renewed it only a single experiment, and the researches must be continued", notes Wladimir Sychew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After the landing, the space rats got new generation.</seg>
<seg id="31">The problematic nature of the propagation directly in the space one was able to solve not yet.</seg>
<seg id="32">The task is difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals, that are torn out of its natural habitat, cannot follow simply its propagation drive.</seg>
<seg id="34">In contrast to animals, the person could that fundamentally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Homo sapiens is capable to abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.</seg>
<seg id="36">Out of ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.</seg>
<seg id="37">Yet women have flown already for 50 years in that all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">There was the largest risk in Tereschkowa.</seg>
<seg id="39">The most valuable that possesses humanity is the organism feminine.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our gull flew therefrom, and following question would have been able to answer no one on the earth: Does it overcome the world space flight?</seg>
<seg id="41">Will it be able to bring a child after this flight to the world?</seg>
<seg id="42">"In the end answered no one this question", says space flight veteran awake seaweed Watschnadse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The first feminine cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, bore in June 1964, only a year after its world space flight, a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, the second woman in that all, Swetlana Sawizkaja, that was twice in the orbit and performed even works outside of the spacecraft, a son bore.</seg>
<seg id="46">Nevertheless a risk remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only extremely few cosmonauts with whom after long flights of all well went and got it healthy new generation.</seg>
<seg id="48">"The more, is the more dangerous it itself in flights into the orbit", concludes cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And yet humanity must after new ways in the biotechnology, that radiation protection and the producing of artificial gravitation seek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The Hydrolabor in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is an obligatory station during the flight preparation.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here in a suspense condition, the cosmonauts win routine for the work in the open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water represents the weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Also if adults perceive water as comfortable, it is a strange environment; but baby perceive water as a natural element.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is, would discard as the small Ichtyander testimonies therefrom that life emerged from at the country the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a context between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and can become accustomed that, that it then more easily to water.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle that is logical because from the birth for first swimming just once 2 weeks pass.</seg>
<seg id="57">"That is too little time, around something to forget", says baby floating teacher Marina Aksenowa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">While for a new-born child the weightlessness is therefore a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In the condition of the weightlessness, the belly musculature and basin musculature disappears enormously quickly and therewith also the capacity decreases to press out here the child.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well well, let's go around that through birth its leading remedies.</seg>
<seg id="61">The birth could take place for example also in a special chamber in order to press out here the child.</seg>
<seg id="62">"But what does then" happen?, reads the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand the child needs also artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without feeling the earth attraction, the organism cannot instruct the skeleton and the muscles.</seg>
<seg id="65">A new-born child cannot be stuck in the orbit like an adult to the training into a load suit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It that will be missing simply, is what kind of life of elementary importance.</seg>
<seg id="67">"This experiment, that we jointly undertake, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, in addition will lead, that we a hindered, a perfectly maladjusted person to the world bring become", says the leader of the bio-ethics commission of the institute for medically biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow, ahead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Previously the birth of children in the universe is bare theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">Sometime it becomes however reality if the earth inhabitants in its spaceships break open to a distant planet, that becomes the home for its in the all born descendant.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">NKÚ boss: Inspection of the black system fails through get into debt of the politics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic controls in the context with public orders good control instances and appropriate laws, falls however into its application back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the conversation for this says the vice president of the highest control office (Nejvyšší kontrolní NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"A law is never perfect, but it correctly must be used - and this is in my opinion here not the case", comments on Kala the current situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">To a similar result, apparently also a joint inspection comes through Czech and German inspectors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As a negative practice example, it leads the attitude of prime minister Petr to that so-called. "Blackly system" on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Did recently the prime minister say that the ODS the entrepreneurs not would annoy with inspections - is the system therefore now forbidden or permits?</seg>
<seg id="8">"A law must yet its validity have, and if somewhat legally forbidden is, can yet not simply the government chairperson come, and the control office, whose duty now once the inspection of the compliance of the law is, in its activity hinder", places Kala firmly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the session of the control committee of the delegate chamber, you spoke over a joint Czech German project, in whose frame the laws of both countries were compared regarding public orders together.</seg>
<seg id="10">About what did it go there concretely?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Test with which we began about two years ago concerns at the same time a parallel.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simplified said, goes it therefore that the European legislature determines, how public orders are to be handled. On that the single national legislations construct. And in the end there is yet the actual practical application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We compared this everything together, and although the test is not locked yet, we were able to assess extremely interesting differences. Generally said, are is the laws here perhaps even something else "severe and more perfect", the actual application however in Germany in some parameters better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Therewith is confirmed that it does not pass to set up again and again new and more exact rules. One must concern himself also with the actual application the to the right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To what extent can the project be you an aid? What results for you from this project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just such a joint inspection could contribute in addition that we stop striving us permanently around a Perfektionierung of the laws and the decline and Austarierung of threshold values if this not especially positively has an effect evident.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Economics means to not to acquire a thing to a sensible price (what always the lowest price is) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or quite criminal actions.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the decline of threshold values for orders does not guarantee that we reach this goal also.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps it is even so that we burden the system in this manner only with excessive "paperwork", and that that seek spaces in the system more simply have, it substantially to exploit the system as if the threshold values remained higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">They speak over the problems in the practical conversion of the Czech award law.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the control system in Germany function?</seg>
<seg id="22">Are there here a similar authority such as our NKÚ, or the system functions differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What the authorities concerns, similarly is constructed is the German counterpart to the NKÚ the federal board of audit, that like here and also over a council ordered, that is formed solely somewhat differently. Basically both authorities work however similarly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also the competences are to one certain mass comparably whereby Germany is however a state, i.e. that there are these boards of audit also in the single states - therein differs the German system of our.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The BRH may control only federal means, what corresponds to our national means.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public means, that are administered here by the districts and communities, are subject there the inspection of the country boards of audit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What concerns the German legislation, is that simpler than our?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Generally I would compare this without concrete statements only unwillingly. Nevertheless Germany in certain regard is designated often as an example whereby one not however certainly can say, that Germany in all is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Does that lie perhaps that there the inspectors are better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">That does not determine said, but how: I do not like such comparisons especially gladly.</seg>
<seg id="31">To this yet is to be noticed in that also those countries that are for us an example have to fight also with problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Would otherwise they not have yes nothing of a collaboration with our authority, aware?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What concerns the Czech legislation, which meaning the amendment of the award law had for your authority, sense already any effects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In consideration its that this novel is first short time effective, has an effect it in our tests until now not yet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because our inspections retroactively take place, one must here with one certain delay calculate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">We perceive obviously will have an effect effects sooner in the preparation phase of future inspections - so have we the new control instrument "recognition of risks of the uneconomical-ness" introduced and with this almost 14,000 public order tested and analyzed - here until now the changes because the threshold values change themselves, the conditions for certain types of announcement modified became among other things</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Do you see the dismissal of this law sooner positively, or the system with further bureaucracy is burdened?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think, determine is that this law a step into the correct direction and hope that this acceptance is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">It can appear however the problem that the rules become "more severe" and can be kept no longer.</seg>
<seg id="40">Already under the prior rules, that of a test are subjected people vis-à-vis the carrier (for example, in the case a grandpa rational program of the regional politics, that regional advice) indicating account compulsory that each non-observance of the award law of an injury matches the household discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is it then however meaningful to make the law yet more severe?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">In my opinion not in this manner.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude those, must punish, that want to attack and abuse the system, and not those, that committed an irregularity, that does not affect the actual decision-making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a system pressures solely the bureaucracy even larger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Where is the exit here?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Let's say first of all once, whom way is not goal leading.</seg>
<seg id="47">The prime minister said recently that the ODS the entrepreneurs not with inspections the so-called. Would "blackly system" behelligen become - what is named that exactly?</seg>
<seg id="48">Is the black system forbidden now or is permitted?</seg>
<seg id="49">A law must have yet its validity, and if somewhat legally forbidden is, the government chairperson can come hinder yet not simply, and the control office, whose duty is now once the inspection of the compliance of the law, in its activity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It can say: "We change the law and permit the thing", but it cannot say that we do so, as if would nothing be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The award law contains relatively severe rules over the formal execution of certain processes - and that is also correct for the protection of the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">On the other side, it is however also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded alone on the basis of irregularities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law never will be perfect, but correctly must be used it - and that is that what is missing here in my opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Šimon Ornest: On our concerts, we want to gather positive energy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about the fact that in less than a month the end of the world should take place?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">That is one of those catastrophe messages, on which we start people so gladly.</seg>
<seg id="4">With our volumes The Tap Tap, we make ourselves sooner about that amusingly and say that we are the single volume of the world, that can gather sufficient positive energy in order to delay or to prevent the end of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December you realize moreover a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Can you more closely introduce our readers the project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It we concern plan a nationwide Benefizveranstaltung, that already two years.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for the 21st of December around 11:10 clock mornings.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the day before that, i.e. on the 20th of December, simultaneously three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava take place from 21:00 clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">The end of the concerts should be in about at present, to which on the Pacific island Kiribati, that lies in a time zone around 12 hours before us, the Maya calendar ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Of whom does this idea come?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally probably of me, we subsequently arranged the idea jointly with our graphics Honza Augusta.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time we would like to gather not only sufficiently positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, but rather we would like to think also together with the public about that, in which condition deliver we this world once our children.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we developed also a unique collection of shoes, T Shirts, pockets and key followers against the end of the world, with whose purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people can support us also.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The volumes The Tap Tap also that has together with other interpreters moreover so-called. Hymn against the end of the world with the title "end of the world falls out of" received.</seg>
<seg id="16">Already today the hymn is chosen on YouTube very. Will it sound also on the Benefizkonzerten?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Obviously, and to be sure entirely to the end, prefaced that everything out does not work and the end of the world takes place...</seg>
<seg id="18">The hymn simultaneously is supposed to be sung by all interpreters on all three concerts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Moreover the hymns live are transmitted together in a direct control of the Czech television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The text of the hymn comes of Tomá Hanák, that also the principle figure of the Jesus in the videoclip plays, also Xindl X sings with...</seg>
<seg id="21">How did you come to the collaboration with both?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We cooperate realize also with further personalities of the Czech culture scene, what holds together therewith, that we many Benefizveranstaltungen and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We strive to bind these people intensively into our projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time appeared that that are interested at a collaboration with us, and have joke on that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Which purpose do the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world benefit?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the arrangement of the barrier-free development center Studeo at which we work already six years together with the society Tap in that.</seg>
<seg id="27">The students the are looked after regularly of lecturers, that help them in different leisure time activities.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because the students do not control even the means, in order to search for the lecturers, we would like to help them in this manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">In frame of the completion the an own building should emerge, in which we take in then with this project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In every concert, several groups and interpreters appear.</seg>
<seg id="31">After which criteria did you choose this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We wanted to assemble a program, that addresses all generations including children.</seg>
<seg id="33">In Prague appear for example China ski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with served Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Suchý.</seg>
<seg id="34">You learn all further on the webpage www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are similar "large organizations" also for the future planned?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In May we appear for the first time at the citizen of Prague spring, and also for this concert, we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year we would like to appear also gladly in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we then already once in the USA are - this would connect also gladly with entrances in Washington and Chicago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Your foreign plans are appeared not exactly small, you already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow until now.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is however a group that consists of people with handicap.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you master these trips logistically and organisationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as bad as it appears on the first view.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five of our members are must be conveyed wheelchair driver, i.e. the wheelchairs in the baggage room. Moreover we must drag along naturally many instrument suitcases and other baggage...</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless it worked out previously always without problems, and British Airways were prepared always very well for us that I partially already was surprised sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow where we were recently, gave it no problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison how it looks in the single countries with barrier freedom, like one there with hindered person goes around etc.</seg>
<seg id="46">How did you experience these things previously?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and further cities, in which all better functions than here, we were straight in Russia of witness its that in the East of yet all in its beginning is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Opposite Prague is not Moscow absolutely behindertengerecht. There it is still unusual if someone is in the wheelchair alone in the city center underway.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is there not yet once obvious that one admits a wheelchair driver for example in the procession.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately societies that try emerge also there to refer to the problems of people with handicap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in which regard must we developed make up vis-à-vis that further countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are hang yet many things, in which we afterwards...</seg>
<seg id="53">In addition however yet is to be noticed in that an improvement of the situation also always depends on the exertion of the concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usually that also people with heavy handicaps move independently in the public room, into the museum go, use can etc. toilets.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is however not exactly usual that there a larger group of hindered people is involved actively in the social events, therein are we with the volume The Tap Tap the west a few ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect in the public and barrier freedom is a thing, but first if out of our rows important athletes, artist, actor, politician or lawyers come, really will begin the things to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">Until now these are only individual cases of especially will strong personalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Tap Tap is presently very popular. If we return however a couple of year: What did you motivate in 1998 in addition to establish a volume?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">At that time I began as a caregiver in that where I met many young people, who were interested on that to be concerned with somewhat intensively.</seg>
<seg id="60">And there I myself musician am and play among other things Saxofon, established I together with a colleague a music CORP.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and gradually that is, like our moderator, to say maintains, run (laughs) something except inspection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Did well known become err me the volumes however not until the last years, or I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It agrees, helped has us that the collaboration with well known singers; moreover have we also begun to advertise actively for us.</seg>
<seg id="64">Not deliberately became that, if one performs something and this is not to be seen outward, the own achievement in certain sense existed us.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the EU promote moneys, we can furthermore good lecturers, high-value devices and and the like afford.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Was it your goal of bringing it with The Tap Tap so far?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the beginning I sensed the potential that one can concern the things differently.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the Showbusiness copies today often one the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">That is in its manner logical because all new is observed with caution and is accepted first after longer time.</seg>
<seg id="70">There is only few things really unique, and I venture to maintain that Tap Tap belongs in addition.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression that the spectator has usually is obvious empathy; that is only natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this empathy is absolutely superfluously because people with handicap are no solitary and left beings, that we would have to regret.</seg>
<seg id="73">People, who can live a full life and can develop, are as far as they have the means necessary in addition.</seg>
<seg id="74">I say always that if people with handicap succeeds something, this not only for it itself a progress is, but rather for the entire company.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Was it for this success also helpfully that you are a severe boss, how one hears of many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If one would like to make somewhat well, one may go in in many things no compromises and must call for also a certain discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is in my opinion however totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some come to us with romantic presentations, and if they assess then, that they have twice the week sample, preparation phases graduate must and spend much time on concert trips, goes out the enthusiasm in many quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">So it functions however everywhere, in every volume, that seriously wants to work and wants to reach something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Presently The Tap Tap of twenty members has.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them have been from the beginning, i.e. since 1998 there?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only a more only: .</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent that.</seg>
<seg id="84">Who has the will and the desire at the joining in, is here always welcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Finds instead of at the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 21 o'clock</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Poland and the space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Past week was received Poland on a cabinet council session of the member nations of the European space organization ESA as a twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is therewith the second member nation out of the former Eastern bloc (to the Czech Republic, that at the 12th of November 2008 ESA member became).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began a narrow collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and tade part in the following years at several ESA projects.</seg>
<seg id="4">The way of Poland in the space began to be sure much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Already before the second world war, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space flight busied itself whereby they bumped therewith not always into understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I remind one here for example of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of the 6th of December 1933 in the Resident of Warsaw observatory with which the author introduced thought out of its pioneer work "entrance to the Kosmonautik".</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (give. 1905) the listeners let themselves remembered however coldly, and after years Šternfeld yet that solely Dr. had shown Jan Gadomski interest in its work.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld won the Prix REP deer established by Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis deer in 1934 for "entrance to the Kosmonautik".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became later an important advocate of the astronomy and the space flight.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish periodicals published it hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Contribution acknowledged Gadomskis worldwide to the development of the space flight was lauded among other things in that one of the crater was named on the earth turned away side of the moon after it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in 1925, a railroad Draisine was constructed in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.</seg>
<seg id="13">The author of the design and the details this intention remained unfortunately unknown.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not clarified yet once whether the rocket should be used for starting or for braking the Draisine.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information to this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933, the Polish infantry began to concern itself with rocket operated stories.</seg>
<seg id="17">The institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi led the research projects.</seg>
<seg id="18">Out of the traditional documents is evident that the research had advanced into the stage practical tests.</seg>
<seg id="19">The research was interrupted then to be sure through the invasion of the German armed forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In 1937 immersed in the specialty press of that of Ing. Coming designs of a photo electric hunt rocket up, and in the year following on that appear the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects concerned themselves with the military utilization of the rocket drive.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war, all projects were coordinated to the military utilization of the rocket technology of the temporary scientific consultation sow shot (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).</seg>
<seg id="23">The from shot was arranged 1937, was concluded its work after two-year activity however by the beginning of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Further articles to the space flight appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space flight company (pole skis Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">The first mention of this company results 1954 in the November edition of the periodical Problemy in which four extensive articles of the space flight are dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="26">The article of prof. M. Subotowicz contains the suggestion to the foundation of a space flight company.</seg>
<seg id="27">At present there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was to be seen that the investigation of the space future would have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Already in its beginning in 1956, the Polish space flight company PTA strove joins around one to the 1951 established international federation for space flight, and actual 1956 orderly member became the PTA already in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the following year, the first PTA chairperson, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), deputy chairperson of the international federation became for space flight.</seg>
<seg id="30">It possessed this office to its death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 the PTA has been involved authoritatively in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for the scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type that completed became RM-1, in 1957 that first start resulted on the 10th of October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket with a maximal altitude of 1800 ms was about 80 cm long and weighed not entirely 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later an improved version that RM-1A constructed,, and 1959 became began in the flight tests with the two step rocket RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was 1.4 ms long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">A further development step should be already in a position to perform real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and should come for the observation of Höhenwinden to the use.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 1962 however the further development was adjusted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Successor of the first rockets of the type RM became developed that in the years 1962 to 1965 Meteor-1-Rakete.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was conceived as a two step rocket, its overall length amounted to was 510 cm and the start weight 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of this rocket, three types were developed distinguished (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), that from one another in the size of the carrier room for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor-1A-Rakete controlled frame fortune, Meteor-1B a carrier room with 0.4 liter over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximal altitude amounted to 37 km in all three types.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2-Rakete was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.</seg>
<seg id="44">Meteor-2 a start weight of 380 kg had and was in a position to convey a payload of 10 kg into a height of approximately 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">After that the versions were constructed Meteor-2H and meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Worth mentioning also that is joins Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 on which two years followed later the foundation of a national COSPAR committee.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland was involved in the frame of the Interkosmos program also in the space research with Soviet satellite, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became after the Czech Vladimír Remek of second Interkosmonaut.</seg>

<seg id="1">The lifting of the law over public-spirited works is no solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the past week, the constitutional court canceled the law over public-spirited works.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision evoked a lively discussion in the public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is certainly interesting to observe the problematic nature once of a wider perspective from.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of the unregulierten of economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the end effect, this means that the single economic systems in a permanent conflict stand together.</seg>
<seg id="7">Cause for that is the principle of the free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of the private capital that goes with unrestrained finance speculations hand in hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Based on the large differences of the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept, a condition is to be understood, more favorably were with which the manufacturer tries, through importations in the economic competition to exist in that he "underbid" the competition in order to tear through it a larger market share at itself and to increase its profit.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the large standard, this means for most businesses to transfer its fabrication abroad or to shop there favorably, or to abandon however its business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparably high cost of labor.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because the private capital bears no social responsibility and therewith also no responsibility for unemployment caused by it, the country editions climb of necessity.</seg>
<seg id="12">This situation yet is reinforced in that the Mr. entrepreneurs are absolutely indignant to pay its taxes and to replace through it the damages caused for society as a whole economic and social by them.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is generally well known so that concrete statistics are superfluous here.</seg>
<seg id="14">The ruthless practice of the private capital creates in the single economic systems a situation, in which the governments see forced themselves, to step in competition together, in order to sink the social level of the own population artificially and to attract therewith foreign capital into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words: The governments deliver the own population without consideration on the social consequences to the private capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">This expresses itself especially in changes of valid laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">It that own population to force in addition is goal of these measures of accepting the dictation of the private capital especially in the wage area.</seg>
<seg id="18">This happens to the one through economical compulsion in long-term unemployment, to the other through the circumcision of the employee rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result are growing poverty, as well as always larger differences between arm and empire.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there have been already for some years public groceries duty places for arms, that are no longer in a position, to eat through own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The amount of the concerned goes already into the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the course of the increase of the competitive stature the German economy it comes regularly to cases, in which employees receive a so slight wage, that the country must increase its income to the existence minimum.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal became also in the case of assistants busied in the German Bundestag uncovered.</seg>
<seg id="24">The savings measures practically all EU south countries will run out undoubtedly on the same condition, with which the people are forced under the pressure of a catastrophic fall of its social level, to hope to emigrate (like it in the 19th century the case was), or for a hunger wage at the edge of the company to darben and there on that that sometime private investment capital will flow into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Does here impose comes itself nature appropriate for the question, from where this capital?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it comes out of one of other EU country, poverty of a country in the other hikes solely; or the capital remains work equally very from, for in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco or Egypt and/or in Africa generally the employed for a fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This concerns entirely Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theories and media maintain to the disgust that the country may not itself with capital at its own economic system of involved, and that planned economy leads to the economy catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private capital persists narrowly on its standpoint that the country may not interfere directing into the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then one must ask himself however whether the private capital does not influence or quite directs the politics and therewith the entire country in the own selfish sense.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here the unambiguous answer is: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof for that is the existence of a practically almighty and in all countries omnipresent lobbies.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is is a despairing situation in the area of the corruption, the mutual before division, a legislation, in that practically all punishable, but nothing punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is so that a state ministry delegates lacking finances private, thickly with the industry entangled right business with the elaboration of drafts of a bill.</seg>
<seg id="35">These drafts of a bill are dismissed subsequently in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All force comes then no longer from the people how it announce the western constitutions, but rather of strong finance groups, that prefer its own interests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Obviously the liberal democracies run describes presently quickly into a situation, like it Appian in its work to the crisis of the Roman republic at times Cäsars and Pompeius' : "The country was grasped were occupied already for some time in the ruin, and the offices with force.</seg>
<seg id="38">Against bribe, through illegal Erschleichung of advantages or with stone and sword.</seg>
<seg id="39">The corruption proliferated unrestrained, and the people went with already bought voices to the choice"... "People with character did not apply had" himself for offices, so that the country as a result of this decline for eight months no consul... "One began to speak already really about that that the single medicine in this heavy situation would be an alone domination, and that a strong man selected become would must"... Appian thought at the same time to be sure of Pompeius, but the strong man was then in the end Cäsar that the democracy replaced durably by the alone domination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">How appears, the current company is based just as as in the antique on the ruthless preference of the own advantage without paying attention to for society as a whole interests.</seg>
<seg id="41">The private capital is not already of its nature here in a position, that advantage to recognize and to put through for the entire company.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result, today like at that time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elite, that themselves not in the slightest around depth issuing reforms strive.</seg>
<seg id="43">We must the cause for the recovery of the fascism and communism therefore in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems in that 19th and 20th century seek.</seg>
<seg id="44">Of the current condition out of seen, can be looked at the downfall of these regimes for the benefit of liberal democracies as a certain recess, with which the next round already is outlined.</seg>
<seg id="45">Especially catastrophic the fact is that the current elite the losses possible in the future by hundreds of thousands of human life, that humanitarian and social catastrophes, whose witness we are already today as well as the crimes against the humaneness, how we know it out of the older and newer story, in perfect ignorance vis-à-vis stand.</seg>
<seg id="46">The lifting of the law over public-spirited works is here no solution, at least no durable.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced, also to seek further ways, in order to press the social level of the population downward.</seg>
<seg id="48">This trend is therefore system contingent.</seg>
<seg id="49">The single solutions are aimed politically social reforms, that increase the capital participation of the country at the economy, that influence of the citizens raise to the government and the monopoly position of the private capital in the company weaken for the benefit of the country.</seg>

<seg id="6">I would not like to write here about that, who in these always recurring waves of the killing more indebted and who is to victim; in the end the current inhabitants of Israel became including the autonomy zones into the present political situation there innate and even did not experience the start of the force.</seg>
<seg id="7">It goes me therefore to open the readers the view behind the scenes, that view on that, whom the 95 years serviceably are tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Near East above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">My thoughts rely partially on accessible historic facts, others are derived from this and go out of my own understanding therefrom forth, who authoritatively influences and/or which group of people the events of the modern story.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The story of humanity is primarily a story of the fight for the power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In every epoch, we can settle an Alexander the large or a Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="11">That what is less evident, the question is whether it were really always these personalities themselves, that determined its steps autonomous, or whether behind its throne someone stood, that its deeds on a before certain goal directed.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must admit ourselves that we live in a time, in which the wealth of the world in the hand less more individually concentrates, and that this concentration of the money and the power following from that did not emerge within the life span of a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Under these astronomically rich families does not stick out designate could one especially, that one as a head of the Kraken (I knows, whether over them yet someone stands, I latch this however not out of) - the Rothschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Much is not written over it.</seg>
<seg id="15">Understandably.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press agency (Reuters) was bought of the Rothschilds already in the '90's of the 19th century in order to stop the connection its by the name of with highly criminal deeds, in whose background always the establishment of its power, that stood increase of its fortune or both.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries, in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or mobilize itself on this (before the attack on Afghanistan were it 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq were it 5 countries, after the slump Ghaddafis remained only four, whereby Russia in the meantime its central bank of the Russian government imputes has).</seg>
<seg id="18">To oppose who also always tried, this family, had to pay with life for that.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln rejected it to renew the status of Rothschilds bank of America as a central bank, began during the civil war to publish own (sprich: national) banknote and was murdered 1865 in a theater.</seg>
<seg id="20">J. F. Kennedy began to publish own banknote and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered 1963; the delegate Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned 1936 after he wanted to accuse the FED because of from solution of the world economic crisis in 1929.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The global Machtgelüste of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan to the Entfesselung of three world wars through Albert Pik, a free mason of the 33rd and therewith highest degree of the insight.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war had should be broken should reduce create as a goal, to remove the large monarchist country beings of Europe, by the second war especially the colonial domination of Great Britain, and the third war the world population on approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (such an amount would become for its convenience and its luxury provide and would become also not so many resources consume), an universal religion (the Ökumenismus is here nothing further than the forefield) and Lead in the end to the acceptance of the absolute power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method, with which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works at the tip, is the from solution of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order out of the chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are however incorrect and lead always to the aggravation of the situation (see foundation of the FED, therewith itself crises such as that of them in 1907 released do not repeat).</seg>
<seg id="25">After it was arrive them through the murder of the Habsburger Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo, to release the first world war, they destroyed the Russian czar empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.</seg>
<seg id="26">The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the annihilation of the Russian czar empire was the war no longer required), subsequently resulted the solution of the Central European great power of Austria Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">In order more simply to be able to kindle the second world war, let create the bank through the politics a latent conflict situation in that they covered Germany with gigantic war reparations; through it created it the prerequisite of become impoverished measures so that they had to pass off the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, who named the indebted and offered simple solutions; a further factor was the creation of the much people country Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, that the function one Fifth columns take in should and took in also in order to kindle the war fire.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28">The Rothschilds initiated end of the 19th century the foundation of the zionistischen movement, with which a branch strove for the foundation of a Jew country, if possible on the historic zone of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return after Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The already mentioned Balfour declaration created the prerequisite for the measure immigration from of Jew to Palestine; it came to first collisions with the resident Arabic population.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were terrorist attacks on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The second world war broke out, and whether now Hitler of the chain off tore himself, at whom it the international banks initially had held, or whether all ran after plan, is to be estimated only heavily, created in any case the sorrow of the European Jews in the concentration camps the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish country through the world partnership.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was established in 1948, and just as as by the war reparation against Germany the ground for the second world war prepared became, places the declaration of the country Israel the creation of the focus for the third world war there.</seg>
<seg id="33">If it will succeed the international banks, to unleash this war, the Jewish people similarly in the second world war becomes the victim in the frontmost battle line, this time together with the Arabic and/or Muslim population of the Near East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a gigantic laboratory, a source of the dispute and the chaos, not only in the country even, but rather also internationally (one would keep in mind only, like sharply itself the people in follower and opponent of Israel subdivide).</seg>

<seg id="1">The film Argo: If it stands most badly, call Hollywood</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979 occupied a Mob of demonstrating Islamist students the US American message in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.</seg>
<seg id="3">For whose release they demanded the extradition of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, that was implored after the revolution into the USA, that had preserved over decades the patronage over its regime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the American government, there was no positive exit out of this situation - it was not able to afford it to throw the Shah over board because this massively would have damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">Simultaneous it was not in a position, in the Iran where the revolution flowed into the installation of a theokratischen regimes to put through the release of the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a heavy blow for the call of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of the hostage release made all only more badly.</seg>
<seg id="7">That caught were released taken diplomat in the end after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated through the Algerian government.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fate of the hostages evoked at home a wave of the solidarity as well as antiiranischer moods.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in the Iran contributed considerably to the defeat Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The film Argo of the director and actor Ben ape leak describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small part victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">Directly before the occupation of the message, the flight succeeded six message colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="12">This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">It succeeded helped the CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the fugitives out of the Iran; at the same time them an extravagant story to the Verdeckung of its true identity - it traveled camouflaged with Canadian passports as members of a film rod, whom nominally in the country film location visited for a Science-Fiction-film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of the genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">That of the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed made plan also the collaboration Hollywoods required.</seg>
<seg id="16">So that the disguise became trustworthy, articles appeared over this film project in trade journals, it were held off press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of this operation were held long secret. The film relies on the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Ape leak film is a special combination of several film genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one side, it is a realistic Politthriller, simultaneously however also a so-called. "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a gelungenen of hussar piece such as for example the film Ocean's it Eleven.</seg>
<seg id="20">Through it the mood plains change themselves in the film from - on the one side the Dokumentarszenen out of Teheran (in the title sequence become ikonische contemporary photographys shown, and also in the film frame of the same situations gives it no large differences).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other side the loose passages from Hollywood, that ironically and easily exaggerates come therefore.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there are yet the scenes out of the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the discussion table, on the office halls, at the telephone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben ape leak a remarkable new start of its career is arrive with this film.</seg>
<seg id="24">Out of one, actors smiled at became a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is now no longer the goal of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is its third feature film after the Krimi no children's game (Gone baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">It is simultaneous ape leak first film that does not play in the native Boston of the director.</seg>
<seg id="27">The feel for the atmosphere of the place belonged at the same time to the features, that removed the prior films of this director of the standard Hollywoods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ape leak proves this feel however also in Argo where Teheran becomes "played" by Canada.</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show really taken place have the reconstruction of events, that - the entrance sequence of the Erstürmung of the message is in its clarity very impressively, and the feeling of the confusingly-ness and the unpredictable-ness that enters mediates at the same time nevertheless, if somewhere once the story moves.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect obtained ape leak with its team also in fictional scenes (the incorrect film rod on one was based in Teheran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much action on too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The director had to explain himself also therewith that the story does not offer actually many scenes exciting in the filmischen sense.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the few, it works however quite successfully whereby it helps reality sometimes something - what then not always so elegantly causes, (the scenes, in which the threatening crisis on the airport in Teheran of a telephone call in America turned away becomes, or also the pursuit hunt on the runway, cause something gekünstelt).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is its all too wide dispersion that is stipulated by the necessity of having to show too much at action on too many places.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in its rolls to be sure very charming as Hollywood colleague, its figures would have earned however more room, and therewith they stand in the film by far not alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Ape leak film loses through it something at pulling power. It is a film that one pursue with certain interest and can at the same time the formation and the Retro style remembering at a Thriller out of the 70th years goutieren.</seg>
<seg id="37">It wakes enthusiasm however only heavily.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a memory of an until piece in certain manner living today story and as a proof its, how the presentations by the almighty and omniscient secret services covered are yet, is it however sufficiently.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, that annually a survey exclaims over the most absurd bank fees, concluded this year to arrange the competition ordinance "most absurd and/or idea out of the EU workshop".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"On this idea brought us the plan proposed recently by the EU, a woman quota of 40% in the management of large European firms to introduce", said Patrik Nacher, that attends to the organization of this survey, vis-à-vis the newspaper Právo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Under the nominated absurdities, the judgment of the European court is for example over the unification of the insurance tariffs for men and women.</seg>
<seg id="5">Until there, women wetted an advantage in life insurances because they represent a slighter risk for the insurance companies objectively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Further incredible ideas out of the EU workshop can be nominated until end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The actual voting results then until the end of February 2013", divided Nacher with.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">To the controversial EU ordinances, the binding addition of organic ethanol belongs among other things to fuels, that is in its consequence nature damaging, the further the ban of the dependable mercury thermometers only because these contain a relatively slight quantity of this danger material, or also the guideline to the size of chicken cages, because of which this year eggs more expensively became substantially.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Criticism harvested also the factual ban of the use of the concept in the past "Butteraufstrich" or also the sale ban for conventional light bulbs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Bananas must be long 14 cm</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The EU apparatus decides often under the pressure of this or those lobbies out of trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are represented as a rule of one or several member nations, (so tries the Czech Republic presently for example, also with veto threat the demands of Czech banks to put through).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Lobby interests stood also behind it that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and may show no "curve anomaly".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The European commission defended itself at the same time with the argument that it would harmonize solely the inconsistent single national standards, that would hinder the trade.</seg>
<seg id="14">The standards regarding fruit and vegetable were softened of the EU against the resistance of some countries already with the reference that the previous guidelines would lead to a waste of groceries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A candidate for the victory in this survey is possibly the EU ordinance of the past year, that equipped will must in accordance with air balloon in the sale with the reference, that children may not inflate under eight years the air balloon without supervision of an adult.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU referred at the same time to an American study, that in accordance with air balloon the leading cause are in asphyxiation death of children.</seg>
<seg id="17">A similar restriction applies already to children until 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">There are strange ideas also at home</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Relatively absurdly also a guideline, that is concerns the European officials themselves - every, that in the EU an official function takes in, the label Macedonian may not use because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must say instead FYROM (form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The server Bankovnípoplatky. com nominated in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez fair next to that above mentioned. Absurdity also the EU ordinance on the circumference of groceries supplies in the field of a member nation.</seg>
<seg id="21">The EU determined joins be might therewith the highly volume at groceries supplies, that at the day of our EU it in the field of the Czech republic.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Czech Republic exceeded then for example the determined volume for fungus canned food for what a high fine threatened us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The organizers of the survey were impressed also of the idea that certain countries money should receive for that, that they have no sea, or to give however of the idea, promote moneys for proposals on promote moneys.</seg>
<seg id="24">These ideas came to be sure not from Brussels, but rather from Prague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"We are handicapped in that we have no sea.</seg>
<seg id="26">We will apply for reimbursement in the EU", explained the at that time country Secretary of Commerce Jaroslav Palas in the autumn 2004.</seg>
<seg id="27">As an argument, it led on that the grain harvest had been very high and the national warehouses as a result of that so-called. Intervention purchases overfilled were.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Because the Czech Republic would have a further way to lake harbors, the EU should pay Euro according to Palas hundreds of millions at us.</seg>
<seg id="29">The European commission came the Czech Republic in the end so far toward that it organized an announcement over the purchase of grain out of countries, that have no access to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="30">Promote moneys for proposals on promote moneys offered the ministry for regional development under direction of minister Pavel (US DEU) to the communities, concretely should concern it at the same time means for the Aufsetzung of Fördergeldanträgen at Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">EU: Bizarre ordinances are the exception</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Ordinances are earned in the member nations to be sure easy to the target of the criticism, the efforts of the EU around regulation of and therewith also around effectiveness and development the entire European Union in the opinion of some experts however sooner recognition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">A more serious problem the EU promote moneys are in the opinion of these experts sooner for projects, that jointly have purely nothing at all with the involvement of the European integration, that were forced however in the household negotiations by single member nations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Emotions also the fact evokes in this country that the Czech Republic of labels specific similar to other member nations in Brussels around the right on use of traditional products must fight and not always wins this battle at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Czech Republic was able to defend to be sure the label after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria "Olomoucké, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský around), whose tradition go back here into the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename however in "Tuzemák".</seg>
<seg id="36">The label around may be used only for products out of sugarcane distillate, not for products out of sugar beet.</seg>

<seg id="16">In addition the media that want to steal one the honor come confuse, and to lie that the freedom of the word with the freedom.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over me was maintained for example that I would bribe journalists or that I was adviser of Paroubek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Let's speak over your visions.</seg>
<seg id="19">You received the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive fortune explanations over 20 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition you must change laws.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a president, you have no competences in this regard, and only the senate as entire can bring in legal proposals.</seg>
<seg id="22">How do you want to solve this problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As a simple citizen, I intervened that the guide remains a free business, and this could be put through.</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem is the small intellectual politics - if someone comes of to the right or of to the left with a good suggestion, intentionally is rejected this, and the population holds that only up.</seg>
<seg id="25">As more independently impartialer, I order to win over a by far larger potential, support in all parties represented in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage exists therein that I can take myself without Schubladendenken and party dogmas of every party that, what kind of country the best is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you see yourself as a person in the politics sooner to the right or to the left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From Czech point of view seem to me that the people see me sooner to the left.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me, this to the right-links-thinking are however totally unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me is important that we advance.</seg>
<seg id="31">It does not go me therefore whether someone belongs to the left or to the right warehouse; I would like to connect the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always I support publicly every good attempt toward implementation, also if this comes of that or of the ODS, and just as I will turn against bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It displeases you if someone designates you as a Populisten.</seg>
<seg id="34">You do but confirm that not through it, what you just said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If you set up a business plan in a firm, have also an ideal goal and a vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">You would like to approach and this.</seg>
<seg id="37">One can designate this on my account as a populism, but function became discusses all suggestions of which I spoke, in the world already, or it of important expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without support in the parliament, only slogans remain you.</seg>
<seg id="39">And therewith you come in the politics long-termed not far.</seg>
<seg id="40">Do or mine you that it you, if you speak only long enough with the people, succeed becomes to put through for example the material and criminal liability?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other possibility.</seg>
<seg id="42">To convince and to try politician, journalists and the public, to bring it on our side, in order to put through these goals.</seg>
<seg id="43">As a president, it would be for me no problem to request the chairpeople of the parliament parties live on television in addition, to anchor the material and criminal liability for politician, official, judge and district attorneys legally.</seg>
<seg id="44">And the addressed would have to say then where appropriate why they reject this.</seg>
<seg id="45">A strong personality that refers to corruption can exert pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take only once the direct choice of the president that was a salary of the public pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try to find ally for my views and visions.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the politics, I began just recently and try to find the support of the majority for my program.</seg>
<seg id="50">I try always to judge the things themselves; and if it out does not work, go I again into the private sector in six years back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">That sounds a few as if Okamura the Czech Republic should rescue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am no rescuer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know, reach that I alone nothing; therefore have I with several well known personalities about spoken whether they would not like to run for office also for the senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I spoke for example with Radim, that rejected however because of work overload.</seg>
<seg id="55">Moreover I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, that uncovered the fraud in the trade with easy heating oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I began my candidacy with the prerequisite that the people are deeply discontented, but now I am certain no longer.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of the entitled to vote did not go at all to the choices, and that that went, representatives of the Establishments selected usually.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the senate, we are therewith only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people selected such a senate composition that changes will be only very heavily enforceable.</seg>
<seg id="60">Nevertheless I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct choice of the mayors and district captains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Do you think about the foundation of an own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">About that I did not think yet because I have no time to review the past of each potential party member, and also not at all the money for that would have.</seg>
<seg id="63">I have not yet once money for the president campaign; on my transparent account, solely 20,000 CZK are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Do you have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">Express you would see of fortune explanations, how your?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">I estimate my private fortune to be about 60 million CZK.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague, I have a plot of land with a value of 25 million, a dwelling for about 10 million, a further for 8 million, an art collection that is about 10 million valued, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and one Škodu Superb that about a million is valued. And then I have another couple of millions on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Aston Martin a child dream was by the way - James bound pleased already always how he went in the car, gallant to women was me and badly fought simultaneously against that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Do you go an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">They say that you want to change the republic, but you would not like to invest your own money therein.</seg>
<seg id="71">That is not just convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have no 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Should I make about guilt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I stuck already 2.5 million into the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program wakes certainly not all too much interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obligated to challenge the campaign out of own means.</seg>
<seg id="77">The costs for the campaign are taken covered in the reason through my salary as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But of the senator salary alone I could not live; so I could not finance for example my son the English school, that costs 30,000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I wanted to earn only money, I would run for office for nothing at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Do you remain therefore further than an entrepreneur active in order to have your livelihood?</seg>
<seg id="81">Did you not say that you will cut back these activities?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But that does not hold together with the height of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">How promised, I partially cut back my activities.</seg>
<seg id="84">So for example my representative in the spring manager of the travel agency becomes.</seg>
<seg id="85">The people want to see me as a samaritan, who rescues the republic.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I must live yet also of something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">At which monthly income were you accustomed as an entrepreneur?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also further so.</seg>
<seg id="89">As a president, I entirely would adjust my enterprises however.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The MVRDV architects prove, are that the true adventures not only in the head - by the example of Spijkenisse and the most young erected book mountain - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I find the building amusingly, it sees futuristically from, and finally gives it again something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby at the roadside.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a suggested large business, means: It is "but, beautiful already, the house".</seg>
<seg id="4">But I ask me for what we need today another library.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everyone has Internet, iPad and E Books.</seg>
<seg id="6">Is no person going today yet voluntarily into one of these Old-Style-libraries, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a hardly examination needy sleep city before the gates of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 80.000-Einwohner-Gemeinde shows the lowest development rate of the entire Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to work against this stupid circumstance, to contribute concluded one some years ago, to the general standard of education and the seven fictional bridges, that are represented on the Euro certificate, when pretty bepinselte reinforced concrete miniatures to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the development offensive was limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so recognized the city fathers that there would be only a single possibility to become the statistics gentleman: A library must here!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas of the Rotterdamer architecture office MVRDV, master of the rash beam charts and maker of witty, often cynical constructed, took the thing with accustomed composure and appear to the competition Hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grinning in the face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And during the jury yet baffled around itself looked and twitched with the shoulders, piled up bolstered the impudent Maas its selected presents of the size after to a pyramid and concluded its aktionistisch speech with the words: "Love township"!</seg>
<seg id="14">That is it therefore, my suggestion for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years expensive mountain later is poured up the 30 million Euro.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is part of a revitalization project to which also underground garage, supermarket, postal service and a couple belong dwellings adjacent and rowhouse with altogether 50 dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="17">Beginning of November was priced the book mountains Library "best with the second price of NL 2012".</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover the project is nominated for the Dutch nationally Wood Award 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Therewith the faceless town retort is had pass to offer that to date no longer as a postmodern pedestrian zone and a disconcertedly ugly city hall, behind whose white facades one would be tended, to assume a dairy factory, around a piece of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="20">Above all however Spijkenisse controls now the first public culture building in the story of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long way to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: Büchereldorado under cheese bell.</seg>
<seg id="23">There are open itself to be sure an elevator, that leads middle through that mountain massive, but the true room joys and harvest joys in the foot Erklimmen of in heat the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">That all around inner room glazed is bright and clear, the burned latch ground and the elegant street lanterns speak unmistakable the language of a public city place.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban ambience is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">One keeps an already lookout for park bench, dog and soccer playing boy and girl.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally stand the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, that usually uncomfortable and impersonal is", says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We placed the classic room configuration on the head and the harvest area from within outward gestülpt.</seg>
<seg id="30">That in the book mountain is used adept: In the middle, offices, Internets libraries, lie chess club, environment center and house technology headquarters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The black bookshelves, that are once wall disguise, once parapet, once increasing railing, are a special joy.</seg>
<seg id="32">Optics, Haptik and smell are strange.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even inveterate architects and building engineers shake whether the unknown building material the head.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted here with recycling materials work", explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the township Spijkenisse, on inquiry of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we bumped in a friesländischen agricultural business one day into a suitable waste product out of the agriculture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">For many years one has used a millimeter thin Kunststoffvlies in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields as a root document.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is cheap and time efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin textile keeps is, two seasons, after that it ripe for the barrier rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick disks.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under heat effect and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, robust material, that smells a bissl after new car and a bissl after sport shoe, discolors itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps, one arrived at the summit.</seg>
<seg id="42">One is rewarded traveling long at the end the almost 500 meter in the literature café not only with a fantastic prospect for the city, but rather also with Dutch Kroketten and on potted Ficusbäumen.</seg>
<seg id="43">They provide for atmosphere, above all however for the correct humidity in the literature mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Contributions for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"One would become it do not believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass areas a show project as regards ecology", says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heated and cooled becomes with earth warmth.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the book mountains under a glass slump stands, the sun itself seems at sunny days only shortly in that in.</seg>
<seg id="48">The wide Holzleimbinder, that stand diagonally to the glass facade, serve as a tailing and catch a large part of the sun irradiation off.</seg>
<seg id="49">The room climate is very comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fully automatic blinds settle the remainder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic out of the IT SECTOR, ventured already the way into the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde that the Boekenberg quite as a Spijkenisses "a long time overdue soul" designates.</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: To the opening a few weeks ago every inhabitant was invited to contribute a book out of its personal existence.</seg>
<seg id="55">Therewith the optical spaces in the not yet completely equipped library - presently 70,000 pieces - are supposed to be filled first of all once.</seg>
<seg id="56">The draft rose.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are filled until casually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"Is nothing worse than a half empty library", says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think, has every inhabitant thanks to our invitation now a certain relation to this new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that its book part of this building is.</seg>
<seg id="61">And if it is only for decoration.</seg>
<seg id="62">Therewith MVRDV is arrive that king discipline, that one names in the specialty jargon identity foundation.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse wrote literature story.</seg>
<seg id="64">So young and uneducated it also be likes.</seg>
<seg id="65">That is finally a starting point for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "German must play" larger role</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany abstained from voting in voting over the reception of Palestine of the.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, expert for US European relations, balances Berlin therewith on a narrow diplomatic degree.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">German wave: Beginning of the week had signaled Germany first of all that it would agree against the proposal on an observer status of the Palestinian at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Then however Berlin abstained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support that, what the Israelis in Gaza did.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany must be careful to be sure based on its special relation with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="9">But simultaneously I believe that it does not support also the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without to be sure too critically vis-à-vis Israel to be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany abstained from voting also when it went therefore to arrange a flight ban zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was put through in the end of NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Does it fall Germany heavily to relate a clear position in important international subjects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, that agrees.</seg>
<seg id="15">That lies that it shifts just its foreign policy and to be sure away of a politics, that became so to speak of the USA gemanaged, there to a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Impeding arrives that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform politics.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans are found therefore between the fronts against.</seg>
<seg id="18">One expected of them that they do not play a more independent role, on that are it however accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe, they feel itself yet at its roll up to, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy how they have France or Great Britain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What does a "normal" foreign policy mean then concretely from German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows are independent the readiness to relate in national interests also positions, that of which the USA or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, therefore of the exports and its relations to regions, about Russia, China or the Near East determined.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany economy interests are to a certain degree unlike that of the other large powers and therefore must Germany its interests protect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Did these economy interests influence have on the bearing in the Mideast conflict and the voting in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">To the one, Germany has large paragraph markets in the Near East, especially in the gulf countries.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore it must be careful, the public, but also the elite to not to knock in the Arabic countries before the head.</seg>
<seg id="28">That plays in any case a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would want to ascribe that also not too much weight, am that no relation one-sided totally.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it plays in any case an important role in German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Did Germany damage its relations with the USA in that it abstained from voting in important decisions of, about in the voting over Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe, rule in Europe and even in the USA large understanding for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore I do not believe that this was a so dramatic breach, like in the Libyan question.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps Germany will warm up therewith even one certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">For it signals yet that it seriously are taken as an international player and its interests must be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">There are different opinions to the Palestinian initiative in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="37">The USA on the other hand talked things out clearly for a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Based on the American domestic policy, these dissimilarities always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the government has secretly probably rather much understanding under Obama for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But based on the political situation here, publicly naturally cannot represent the government this position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the actual differences of opinion are all so large not at, how they always appear.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relations between Obama and prime minister Netanjahu, Obama is enthused not at all so hellauf of Netanjahus politics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Does it fall Germany heavily to arrange its narrow relations with Israel and the USA on the one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I believe, make exactly that it so hard for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">It would be natural a little simple for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European politics, what presently the case is not.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore they cannot be part of a wider line and must push instead things out of its own position.</seg>
<seg id="48">They make that just with the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe, will receive Germany in the future a leading roll to press Europe to a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">That is naturally not simple for Germany, already because of the relation to Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">That was always already a sensitive subject.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I believe that is clear to the Germans, that they must play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Does Germany itself in the roll see itself as an important international player - wants Germany generally a leading role receive?</seg>
<seg id="54">Does Germany or fall the leadership role yet heavily and heavily?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is not accustomed yet on that, that is yet always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, falls it the country yet heavily and heavily to play a larger role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we look at for example the Euro crisis, there become each time if Germany supposes a larger roll, most varied anti German feelings freely.</seg>
<seg id="57">That does not make it the Germans simply.</seg>
<seg id="58">That is actual the old problem: you does not want to surround be of hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">So seen is Germany in a much more difficult position than the USA.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be impressionable for most varied neighbors and opinions and is that not simple.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Does now the influence of the USA in the European politics not decrease fills remains continuously, that EU this vacuum however, who there in the moment otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will have to play simply a larger role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Also if it does not please them, it them unpleasant is and makes it yet much unpopular - c' est la vie!</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Armani is an universally known brand, Polo Ralph of tepids also.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is however Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">Behind it a label very officially registered in China, that has to do to be sure nothing with the origin businesses, hides.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless it enjoys so long protection how the actual name givers do not complain.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then is not clear whether they get right.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It becomes more and more for foreigner more difficult, its brands in China to protect", says Thomas stalemate hole, lawyer in the office Taylor Wessing who is specialized on protection breach of the law in the far east.</seg>
<seg id="8">A new case lands each week on my desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The imitators rich letters additional already a couple so that they may register its brands.</seg>
<seg id="10">So will let register out of Gucci simple Lu Gucci, instead of Prada one Prada Kny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also German businesses are copied in this manner legal, about the sport article manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Stalemate hole opens a file with entries of the brand-name office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the 14th of September 2010, a Chinese business the trademark Zegna DF Puma let protect there, an art name that made use of also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That the Chinese are world champion in the copying and in the injured of intellectual property, is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the large cities, there are multistory department stores that sell almost excluding forgery.</seg>
<seg id="16">Stalemate hole of cases however are differently: On behalf of its clients, it advances on the other hand that Chinese business of the brand-name office receive very officially the right to use a label, that is protected already elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese name that "anxious Mingpai", a passenger brand.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word orients itself towards "anxious Dakuan".</seg>
<seg id="19">Therewith women are meant, who catch rich men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are themselves no guilt aware</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"That is geschäftsschädigend, one must it fight", demands stalemate hole.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand is diluted, that disappears all attitude, the image damage is enormous".</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the process costs of the concerned industries go into the millions, above all in expensive show products.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion is Euro in the year the third largest market for luxury article and the at the fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Yet cancellations of suspicious entries in the brand-name index are to be reached and are to be gotten heavily expensive.</seg>
<seg id="26">Up to nine years, the procedure can move itself, with uncertain exit.</seg>
<seg id="27">Stalemate hole reports of cases, in which the court complaints rejected, because after the long duration of that name objected to become would be the "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the complainant would have bad luck, he had to pay the plagiarist even money because he injured its brand in China, says stalemate hole.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.</seg>
<seg id="30">Famous cases concern also graphic elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">Daimler lost 2009 a lawsuit with the building machine manufacturer Sany, that business that recently the German concrete pump farmer plaster master received.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chinese may use therefore until today an emblem, that resembles the Mercedes star.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue white Logo that reminded one of BMW; the dispute became had to change geschlichtet, Geely it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitator from Hong Kong and Singapore that the famous crocodile let view into the other direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are themselves no guilt aware.</seg>
<seg id="36">The brand-name office CTMO in Beijing admits to be sure that it had given there 2010 because of to slight personnel equipment and room equipment bottlenecks.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the past year, one would be returned" however of the "need situation in the work flow to the normality.</seg>
<seg id="38">So the existence of unfinished objection procedures had sunk around 22 percent.</seg>
<seg id="39">One had locked almost 57,000 of such cases, 75 percent more than in the preceding year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless wait in the office of still 81,500 objections for settlement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">To concern on the other hand much costs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">How so often in China the numbers are impressively.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the past year, more went in the CTMO than 1.4 million proposals on brand-name protection on, almost one-third more than 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">Let a record be that and mean that China would cite for the tenth time sequentially the list of the new registrations in the world, divides the authority with.</seg>
<seg id="45">That applies also to the existence of all valid trademarks, altogether 5.5 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="46">2011 had been taken in 1.8 billions of Yuan at fees.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simplified that is named that each registration costs on average 1280 Yuan or 160 Euro.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">To concern on the other hand a multiple costs how the case of the German family business joy mountain shows.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since more than seven years, the group against a Chinese plagiarist fights.</seg>
<seg id="50">To be sure the Germans were able to reach that its illegal fabrication imitated motor vehicle part was excavated.</seg>
<seg id="51">Yet the imitator secured himself further the Chinese rights at the brand joy mountain.</seg>
<seg id="52">One himself would have that neglects because in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairperson of the management of joy mountain Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The brand-name office CTMO rejected the objection of the citizens of Munich then also.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the next both instances joy mountain got to be sure quite, but the process opponent fights until today further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">One must pay attention infernal</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now the matter is pending before the colonel court.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confidently, to bring the thing to a good conclusion, and the professionalism of the courts praises.</seg>
<seg id="58">But it says also: "The procedure is extremely costly and costs us much time, money and nerve".</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs let do hardly number themselves, the firm archive had to look through even one hundred year acts old in order to furnish proofs.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago joy mountain of the opposite side offered in vain a "high six-figure Euro sum" to the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"On that sees one, like much us that is valued", says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers in the far east threaten slosh back even to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">If there imitators secure themselves unprotected brands.</seg>
<seg id="64">So a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the label joy mountain for shoes and leather.</seg>
<seg id="65">The group abandoned this business field a long time, nevertheless it was able to turn away the registration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"One must infernal pay attention", says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both it and the lawyer stalemate hole advise German business in addition to be in businesses with China very careful.</seg>
<seg id="68">Do not suffice should to depend on international brand-name rights, rather the foreigners "all, what somehow is worthy of protection, also in China register" how Wentzler says.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise that can become much more expensive than the registration.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the deed: If joy mountain would be subject in the last act of its brand-name drama, one would have to pay probably the opposite side license fees for the own name, explains Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="71">Or we are pressed in the questionable segment out of the market.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Aids day: Tramp, sing, help</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland are happy Aids orphan about that.</seg>
<seg id="3">The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">First the tramping is there: Cowboy boot, basketball shoes, lady pump and Herrenslipper seek the tact on the parquet ground, find it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="5">One-two-three-four.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then first the voices of the singers swell slowly at - old, bass, tenor and soprano - oppress, betören and pursue themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, lifts it almost out of its material shoes if he brings together it with its pliant wild gestures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">It is rehearses Monday evening, in the music room of the institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi a new song.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the fifty singers and singer came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin to the house man.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Om' Obani" no simple piece, each choir voice is still has another text and this also in a very strange language: Zulu that is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts by Swaziland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Aid to the self-help</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Worldwide there is appreciates approximately 34 million HIV infected, that Unaids, the program of the United Nations to the Bekämfung of Aids.</seg>
<seg id="13">23.5 million people therefrom live in the south of Africa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In Swaziland, 245000 Aids orphans live.</seg>
<seg id="15">More than 40 percent of the population are in the meantime HIV positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For 180 Aids orphans in the village Esitjeni, the society found Voices for Africa godfather in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">70 of them visit a continuing school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For 15 or 20 Euro per month, one can receive a godfather shaft.</seg>
<seg id="19">It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Imbongi means on Zulu story narrator or also praise prices.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Bantusprache fluently speak can no one in this room, but sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">For almost ten years the choir of songs in this strange soft language has practiced and diverts it and at also there back where they originally come: into the south of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">For 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies of Heidelberg removes, in the northwest of the kingdom Swaziland, gives it the village Esitjeni that depends on the voice force of the German choir.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About 2000 people live are there, many yet in simple clay cottages and straw cottages, a large part therefrom children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them have no more parents because these are succumbed the HI virus.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Esitjeni appears in the small on what entirely Swaziland suffers: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.</seg>
<seg id="28">Circumcisions of the masculine foreskin, that diminish the contagion risk demonstrably around the half, are hardly supposed of the population.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry is the immunodeficiency virus in itself to die with middle thirty no rarity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">In a joint Africa trip in the spring 2005 discovered the choir the village, above all however saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, which it lacked not only at parental care, but rather simply at all: Eat, clothing, development.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without diploma, one has no chance in a poor country first quite.</seg>
<seg id="32">Originally it was yet the private engagement more single to send for a couple of Euro in the year a child to the school and to enable it a warm meal at the day.</seg>
<seg id="33">The choir later established yet already a year the society "Voices for Africa" that attends since then almost professionally to the Aids orphan in Esitjeni.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Facts to sexually transferable infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the most important sexually transferable illnesses?</seg>
<seg id="36">To the bacterial STI, syphilis, Chlamydien and Tripper (gonorrhea) count.</seg>
<seg id="37">Frequent viral STI are HIV, humane Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Felt lice and Krätze belong to the parasitical STI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who are the main party concerned groups?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and Tripper occur above all with men, who have sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert-cook-institute assumes that at least four are transmitted by five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany by sexual contacts between men.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the heterosexual adults, Chlamydien infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (fungus), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren are frequently occurring sexually transferable illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="43">The distribution of HIV is in this country comparatively slight under heterosexual adult - nevertheless: Approximately 20 percent of the HIVS new infections fall to this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Under youth, Chlamydien infections step substantially more frequently on than in other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">After European elevations, three-quarters concern people young all infections between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In this country humane Pappilomaviren occur moreover with youth frequently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How did the number of the infections develop?</seg>
<seg id="48">All sexually transferable illnesses are not reportable.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of the syphilis infections has according to the Robert-cook-institute of 1697 diseases per year 2001 on 3698 diseases per year 2011 more than doubled itself.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of the HIVS new infections has returned since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">There were 2011 approximately 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Which symptoms refer to a venereal disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">The infectious diseases can evoke abscesses in the genital area, troubles in the Urinieren, outflow, lower stomach ache as well as blister or wart.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often they cause however no pains or other symptoms and remain therefore unseen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can one protect himself?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can decrease the risk of a contagion, offer however no hundred percent protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">For in part pathogens can be transmitted by sexually transferable illnesses also by grease infections and narrow body contact.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore experts recommend above all regular investigations with frequently changing sex partners.</seg>
<seg id="60">Early diagnosed most STI can healed and long-term consequences avoided become.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through godfather shafts, contributions and not finally the salaries, that itself the choir throughout Germany ersingt, meets a few things.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Altogether have we already round 200,000 Euro after Esitjeni sent", says Annette Lennartz, the chairperson of the society.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and execution strong woman, the moneys administers from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">It is concerned also therefore that the orphans find accommodation well, with one of the grandmothers about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The Gogos how one names the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Many of them received up to 14 orphans with itself, give them a roof over the head and provide that the children in its uniforms appear every day punctually to the school instruction.</seg>
<seg id="67">He who has no one more, comes becomes into the protection house Khanyisile, a single woman, that just as of the society paid like both cooks, who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Moreover "Voices for Africa" called a vicinity school into life, constructed two chicken houses and organizes jointly with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have make let a HIV test.</seg>
<seg id="69">That is is no basic assumption, for so obvious the illness in the entire country also, one is quiet it most dearly dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"Aids is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it with sexuality to do has".</seg>
<seg id="72">Actually strangely in a country, in which the kings officially 14 wife holds itself.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Mswati III., is well known for its excessive lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Among other things it is owed also this nationally sanctioned life form that the HI virus in the past decades so quickly spread out.</seg>
<seg id="76">But also the many wall workers who carry the virus through the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">There would be free condoms to be sure at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but that will hardly use.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is another - flesh to flesh".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">Around the cultural exchange something to promote, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years jointly through the south of Africa and sings songs of full melancholy, battle spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many know at the southern point of the Dark Continent yet out of times of the Apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="80">Sing a bus fuller whiter, the songs in a black language - so much recognition brings has not only mood and joy, but rather also already many a grim boundary soldier a couple of tears abgetrotzt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The trip leads always also after Esitjeni where the singers visit its godchilds.</seg>
<seg id="82">Also if one does hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than well known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Goes to Esitjeni, there is say the light" the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And if one returns the 8733 kilometers as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the tramping singers in the sample room at the Bergheimer street, sees illuminate one it also there.</seg>

<seg id="49">Researchers assume that he emerged first shortly after the Big Bang, when in the universe predominantly hydrogen was to be found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our insights in that all: The most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope should have been invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - yet before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to the star observation.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became more and more larger - and the insights that deliver it, always deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">For 30 years, the Hale telescope in the Palomar observatory, namely of 1947 to 1975, was near San Diego the largest telescope of the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.</seg>
<seg id="56">It allows views in that all immediately over two mirrors, every with a diameter of 8.4 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The thoughts and feelings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Kanareninsel La Palma is tremendously - alone of the mirrors comes on 10.4 meters in the diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - around costs to save.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.</seg>
<seg id="60">Disadvantage of the favorable method of building: The telescope is in its height angle festgezurrt - and therewith in its mobility restricts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Also the hobby-Eberly-telescope in Texas is fixed in the height angle.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its peculiarity: the high light collecting power.</seg>
<seg id="63">This passes namely - in spite of comparatively slight mirror diameter - at that of the mirror telescope largest worldwide up to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">By means of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers monitor that all after extraterrestial signals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), every computer owner can help in that he makes available computing power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">View of the observatory of the European observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here the Very Large Telescope stands - that its name all honor makes.</seg>
<seg id="69">With its altogether four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate also the middle infrared spectrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Also on the Chilean ESO observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.</seg>
<seg id="71">Its head mirror should comprise satisfied 42 meters - and out of nearly 1000 mirror elements together set become.</seg>
<seg id="72">With pictures is to be calculated however at the earliest 2018.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007 counted both bold telescopes on the hawaiianischen volcano Mauna Kea as the largest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">They offer immediately two mirrors with an average apiece of ten meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">The bold telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-observatory that looks next to them yet with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF into the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, gigantic telescope should emerge - with a mirror average of thirty meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">Here it is on an illustration to marvel at.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">The most important impressions out of that the space telescope Hubble all delivers however.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since the 24th of April 1990 it has delivered already pictures from a distance worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009 the space telescope Kepler has searched for extra solar planet - especially after such, that are inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">On the 2nd of February 2011 was announced of the Nasa that 1235 planet candidates were determined since mission start.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the picture, the last start preparations are documented at the space telescope Kepler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) becomes all shot at the earliest 2018 on board an Ariane5-Rakete in that.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: It should search for light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume that also at the south pole of the mercury ice exists.</seg>
<seg id="87">To be sure there are for that no reliable data because the messengers circles far more closely at the north pole around the planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements pointed for decades on that that there is ice on the mercury.</seg>
<seg id="89">Through the 2004 started messenger probe - the first, that around the mercury circles -, the scientists have now certainty.</seg>

<seg id="10">Everything is green and juicy, one could mean, one would be in the Black Forest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The deepest south of Azerbaijan, the boundary to the Iran is is removed yet that here only a few kilometer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here the caucasian ethnic group of the Talyschen of which much well known is not lives, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserisch and is very durable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Terminal is Lerik.</seg>
<seg id="14">The small village shows off with to mightily advised architecture out of Soviet times, that wants to fit so not at all into the picturesque mountain landscape.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tourists from Europe come is conveys hardly here, to onerously that of Azerbaijan capital Baku.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the 323 kilometers, one needs eight hours because the street is only single-track.</seg>
<seg id="17">The incredible wealth, that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian sea, did not arrive here in the province yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Yet Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the thing to the tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku became in May with the Euro vision-song-festival famously - and in the next year have we here a festival of the oldest people of the world", says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">It is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen is documented out of the area, that shows more old than 100th Fatulayeva on a black-white-photo.</seg>
<seg id="22">That here is my grandfather, he became 120 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the age of 136 years another child witnessed</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Yet disputed star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Müslümov that 168 years is supposed to have become old.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is not a birth document to be sure.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in view of the oldest documented person, who became 122 years old, Müslümovs age appears yet extremely doubtfully.</seg>
<seg id="27">"1805 became it here in the region born, 1973 died it", clarifies Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man would be married been three times and had had 23 children, should have witnessed at the age of 136 years he another daughter.</seg>
<seg id="29">Did Müslümov reckon itself therefore in its age around a couple of decade?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of the Hochbetagten in means Asia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Incidentally many highly old would jut people gives it also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "also in Sardinia live extremely many very old men".</seg>
<seg id="32">Because of missing documents, no scientific proof is to be led however over the age especially since Personenstandsregister were missing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Butter goblet wise melted every day</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Fact is however that the people of the region reach all around Lerik incidentally frequently a biblical age.</seg>
<seg id="35">Currently there are 20 people who are older than a 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">Why do therefore so many Hochbetagte live here in the south?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.</seg>
<seg id="38">Museum director Fatulayeva on the other hand believes that it would lie at the nourishment.</seg>
<seg id="39">Yet that calculated so healthy be should the food of high-calorie the Talyschen, appears that meat, bread and above all milk products of dear and, of which many drink daily a glass of melted butter, out of nourishment scientific visibility also not exactly plausible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Is it or the original way of life that the people young holds? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement close to the city Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">With its 97 years, it is extend for this yet comparatively young.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva that maintains to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wood house, that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">It sits on the ground with a churn, that rolls here it indefatigably there and.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live are here under a roof, under that one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both a long time grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also two infants jump around.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen, one prepares the guests tea that is served in that typical, belly-shaped Armadu glass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Teeth white Mirzayevas stand conceals perfectly in row and limb, under its scarf it long, dark blond braids that its son reveals proudly before us.</seg>
<seg id="48">I washed my hairs always with milk, went it myself never from and retained its color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Shampoo have I also never uses", says Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Monthly pension passes for life</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It ate always only that, what came of its own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">I long did not buy my entire life a single time in the supermarket groceries.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then it tells of its man, who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most badly it was at the time after the second world war.</seg>
<seg id="55">Yet everything became received better, than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew the oar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The propaganda sounds strangely out of the mouth of an old woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">Yet the cult, that is driven around the father figure of the nation, that be reigned country such as a dictator, knows hardly boundaries in Azerbaijan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Until 2003, it was received at the power, later its son Ilham the oar.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless there is no need under Azerbaijan of old.</seg>
<seg id="60">230 Manat (about the same sum in Euro), receives Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for local ratios a sum of which one can live well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And perhaps also Mirzayevas has a long time grayed son quite: "The old enjoy respect" in our culture.</seg>
<seg id="62">They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, umsorgt and are happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">If that is no reason to remain as long as possible alive</seg>

<seg id="1">Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the most smelly fish of the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">One of the highest standard of living enjoy the five million inhabitants of Norway - and that not only in Europe, but rather in the entire world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Could the success secret of the country have to do something with the local appetite for rather smelly fish?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a selection of overripe cheese sorts.</seg>
<seg id="5">Place it in the middle of a pile more dirtily, damp sport clothing.</seg>
<seg id="6">It and leaves there a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">So approximately one must imagine the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the large delicacy of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am removes in the small city Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is here snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that not simply wants to disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is best regretted fermented becomes with salt trout, that - dependent on, like stink one its fish gladly would have - to a year in water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">If in Norway the darkness comes over the country and becomes the weather colder, stream norwegian to a festival here in Fagernes, that is dedicated this, now, to really very bribing specialties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"One eats it raw and rinses it then with a glass of aquavit down", says Havard Halvarsen, that works actually in the local fire watch, but as a so-called "Rakfisk general" also the festival arranges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Around us around people consume fish cubes small and take in addition large quantities at alcohol to itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk", says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Spirituose can displace the smell.</seg>
<seg id="16">I cost some morsels.</seg>
<seg id="17">If one avoids it to bring the Rakfisk in nose vicinity, it is not bad - about like Sushi, that has a quite long bus trip behind itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of an entire other, by far poorer Norwegian epoch when there were yet no cool possibilities and fish in the autumn in airtight brine casks was soaked.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the deepest winter, it was taken out then after long Fermentierung and - undoubtedly under with the help of senses softened by alcohol - was consumed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Before a generation saw cable would send himself norwegian in search of work forced to leave its country and hiked mainly into the USA from.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Today the population are awake rapid - more than 13% are immigrant, lured of a flourishing labor market, high wages and a comprehensive public health.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even from Sweden, the old rival, that by far pass was as Norway before not yet all too long time, stream immigrant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is looked at as something important - as an essential if also exertally smelling part of the Norwegian story.</seg>
<seg id="24">It belongs to the more expensive courts, that one can buy himself here.</seg>
<seg id="25">But actually is here yes all expensively - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 Euro.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not create it often into the world press, and that does not seem most people to disturb.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here one hates to name it still, differently Breivik in the name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot last year 77 of men, women and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead one has reference only to the "occurrence of the 22nd of July".</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegian have trouble therewith, to accept that someone is capable in its peace-loving country to such brutal murders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Mainly responsible for the current wealth of Norway the growth of one of the largest oil industries and gas industries is since the early '1970's the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But oil is not the single reason, why it us so well goes", says Anna, our waiter, the round trays with ripe Rakfisk distributes and ideally embodies with its long blond hair and the pricking blue eyes the Nordic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are a - how says one - circumspect people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Your English is exact like that of the most people here immaculate.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are not very ostentatious, we like no bragging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway very carefully handled its oil wealth - a large part of the industry yields will invest to the welfare of future generations into a special fund.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">When in the years to the world economic crisis all with money threw around itself, that it not at did all possess, held locked Norway its money stock exchange firmly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as we in the winter ski go and in the summer hike go can, are we happy", says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And naturally Rakfisk eat", joins it with unencumbered laughing thereto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I stand in the snow and stand for another court at - of Rakfisk have I enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">Such a moose castle is in any case something else. The juicy meat mundet me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But in the evening again the stink fish stands on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="42">The hotel in which I room is one of several venues, who organize a Rakfisk Dinner, with which guests can agree for the best - or perhaps the senses of smell of at the strongest demanding - fish.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a live-TV-control to a Showmaster clothed with fly that is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.</seg>
<seg id="44">The spectacle resembles the Euro vision song Contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"Which score do you have there above in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here our points, Havard" are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">One klatscht and laughs.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls overwhelms of its chair, possibly of the aquavit.</seg>
<seg id="49">But perhaps it is yet the severe vapor of the entire fish.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The traffic in Mexico city is current very especially bad.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even at better days, this is clogged one always city, but on Monday a ring was erected out of steel, that closes off several important traffic route into the capital and provides on the streets for chaos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It was not the goal however to disturb commuter on the way to the work, but rather to prevent demonstrators on that, to reach the parliament.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On Saturday the president bandage will receive Mexico of new Präsident Enrique Pena Nieto and will receive the leadership of the nation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It stands before a complex task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Under the separating government Felipe Calderons, Mexico was able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the handle of a drug war, that cost in the last six years already 60,000 human life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government becomes involved strongly for that, the force to reduce", explained Pena Nieto beginning of this week in the oval Office the US American Präsidenten Barack Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can reach this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before it went with the US president at eye level, Pena Nieto was as a governor of its homeland country Mexico active.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this thickly settled, extensive part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions are divided over the new country chief.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A direct man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the remote town Valle del Bravo, one remembers for example gladly it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Inhabitants of the vacation place attribute it the development of the tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to reach the city, one can go on one of the freeways, that let construct Pena Nieto and represent the one large improvement vis-à-vis the brittle, uneven streets, that there was here once.</seg>
<seg id="17">Badges with its name hang also outside of a modern sport center and an impressive interactive museum to climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect of it real and continuous variations", so its friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, that as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, that PRI works.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We hope, especially, what concerns the security and economy, for an interesting and actual variation, that needs our country so urgently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years at the power, the PRI in 2000 of Vicente Fox was removed.</seg>
<seg id="21">The congresswoman Olvera admits that the party places large expectations after 12 years outside of the president palace of lot Pinos at Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accusations of the opposition, the new president false it at substance, rejects he.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">It would be engaged and would have a very direct man, very large plans for the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">Let he be an outstanding statesman, above all would be he however also someone, who can listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the country, many people do not divide this view over its earlier governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also well known as Ciudad Neza, could be not larger the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo.</seg>
<seg id="27">The place lies hidden under freeway transfers and places in regard multifarious a suburb of Mexico city even there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the community are of decisively urban nature.</seg>
<seg id="29">Beginning of this year was turned on the military in order to fight the drug volumes operating in the quarters, and force against women is an especially acute problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On a spot fallow in the vicinity of a large dump the corpses dutzender of murdered women were put back alone in the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="31">While the tenure of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the country Mexico over 1,000 women - a statistics, that exceeds even that of the city Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its force and the murder of innocent women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The critics Pena Nietos are the view that he is concerned the problem of the woman murders during its tenure at least not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="33">Yet in the worst trap, its government had locked its eyes before the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete building, Irinea Buendia with the tears, typically for the come down quarter, fights when it shows me photos of its deceased daughter Mariana Luna.</seg>
<seg id="35">The official version of the events according to Mariana committed 2010 suicides.</seg>
<seg id="36">Yet its family believes that it was murdered by its companion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As I in its home arrived, seemed it, as would be its body washed become", remembers Senora Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">There was sign that it was struck, and the rigor mortis already had used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While its mother tells its story, a picture of Mariana looks of the wall at us down. It is mounted next to a cross, that carries a single word: Justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">One had forbidden yet exactly this, so the family, its until now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The authorities treated me, would be as I a Schwätzerin, trouble-maker, grouch.</seg>
<seg id="42">They would want that one simply accepts its judgment and holds the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But that is not possible, if it so many irregularities and failures gave", says it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">If Präsident Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday the president bandage, it accepts therewith also a large responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Families Mexican ten thousand were affected the last six years by violent crime in, and the new president promised to attend during its tenure especially to this problem.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My Mexican American identity crisis.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Many people would be forced based on the missing chances to left Mexico</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexican tend in addition to accuse the emigrants - it call them difficult times into the memory, says he</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette is the view that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On one recently trip after Mexico city I had crossed and had arrived just recently the hall at the passport inspection when helplessness in me extend made itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there some seconds long, unsteadily, to which I should proceed me.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in headquarters California and was named my entire life long "mexican".</seg>
<seg id="9">An ethnic shorthand symbol - exactly so how my friends in Boston "Iren" or my friends in New York name themselves "Italian".</seg>
<seg id="10">Later I decided on "Mexican American".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But that here was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no requirement after shorthand symbols or dash.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simply only American.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish, at least well enough in order to maintain myself in this language at both ending of an interview.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not control the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I become not my American accent either loose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Therefore I took my American passport and stood into the snake for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about that moment of this week when the future Mexican Präsident Enrique Pena Nieto visited the white house in order to meet with president Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda, all those subjects that one expects stood, if the heads meet both countries: Immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto was interested also very on that to speak over the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that mexican remain nowadays with just as high probability in Mexico instead of emigrating into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would like to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block after example of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drugs cartels, also if it named relating to this no details.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mexico relation to the United States is complicated and full resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans never waste probably a single thought that the United States in 1848 in Mexico occurred and forced the leadership of the country under reproached weapon in addition to leave more than the half of its territory to them.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for mexican, who do not think in centuries and in minutes, memories of not to are surveyed this event.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As soon as therefore a US government official practices criticism also only mildest of Mexico, one - in the Mexican press and under the elite of the country - hears troubles about how the Americans oppress the sovereignty of its neighboring country.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children Montezumas proceed on the war path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet the largest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relation with the more lies than 35 millions Mexican Americans who live in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Speak desire to over resentment?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">Winner and loser has Mexico. People for whom the country chances offers, and other for which it does not do this.</seg>
<seg id="31">The single reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles live, read Vegas, phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, exists therein that at a point in our pedigree a person - perhaps a parents parent or large parent - got offered no chance in Mexico and emigrated toward north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - swarthy, uneducated, out of a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are the descendants of these people, and our faithful counts them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And although we live perhaps now the American dream, good schools visits and receive have good jobs, may lose live we never out of the eyes that it is the American dream, that we - not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity blurred sometimes if possible, but what concerns our loyalty, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="37">This counts unambiguously the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class do not like us.</seg>
<seg id="39">This is based upon mutuality.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a memorial of a humbling defeat and view on us down because we are not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish never will be good enough, our volumes to Mexico never strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">According to your opinion our existence is a symbol of the failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families were not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And then we would not be caught see ourselves now behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but yet somehow lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who were born in Guadalajara and immigrated as a child legal into the United States, remembered that between mexican and Mexican Americans tensions exist, because mexican possess a clearer presentation about that, who it are me - and Mexican Americans take them this vile.</seg>
<seg id="46">While she is US American citizen, she sees herself as a part of these countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">To belong yet many Mexican Americans whom I know, have the feeling, neither to the one yet to the other country.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the Mexican volumes lot Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">One enjoys is the best of both worlds, but in none of them rooted.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we are seen as American.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States, we are seen as a mexican.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">How I should learn during my trip, there is makes something, that this relation yet more complicated: Some Mexican leadership people and parts of the development citizenship would like to receive its connections to the Diaspora again.</seg>
<seg id="53">They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, that represent its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American colleague therefrom how crazy a visit of this country is and exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify its ties to Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Now.</seg>
<seg id="56">That will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many injured feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And in view of the unjust distribution of income, the unbridled corruption and the drug force many of us are certain not at all so whether it concerns really a crazy country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I fear, must there its alone through, Amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">That is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some mexicans are not yet ready, to forgive the United States for the contact with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept also that some Mexican Americans cultivate a grudge, how its members of the family were treated first before not at all so long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are thought "More mexican", than I.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old combats, new Near East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could prove to be an unexpected main pillar for the peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can there be ever continuous peace between Arabians and Jews in the Near East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The newest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the middle of the usual guilt assignments, countless buildings in debris and ash were put, more than 140 Palestinians, that therefrom civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time are hit rockets out of Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolises tels Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Yet although Israelis and Palestinian in its historic conflict seem caught, changes the near East around it around.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arabic spring did not create a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or - Palestinian and Israelis became part of these confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will lead only to more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet there are reasons to the acceptance that the deadly stalemate situation could find finally its end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war, that neither lost yet won becomes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">On the first view, optimism seems in view of the current situation all other as mounted.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the armistice arranged at the 21st of November stops, the dieswöchigen battles the Hartgesottenen strengthened on both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of the Hamas, who Islamist movement, that has controlled since 2007 the Gaza Strip, will maintain of itself to have driven back the Israelis although its grouping had to indicate even large losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gazastreifens in one of the most wretched and thickly most populated corners of the planet are corralled, it is not arrive Israel until now to destroy the Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Actually the Hamas in the West Bank gains controlled becomes, that by the competing, moderated Palestinian group Fatah.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">And the Hamas leaders could come to the end that they have the time on its side.</seg>
<seg id="17">So, how Islamists in the Arabic world won at influence, the Hamas was able to pull powerful and rich friends on its side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, an again gaining strength, regional power, that counted as Israel of narrowest Muslim ally once, seized for the Hamas party - exactly like Qatar, one of that pass and most dynamic gulf countries.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rejoicing Hamas followers believe that around Israel an Islamist crescent moon forms - of the Lebanon in the north where the militant Hisbollah has the power, over Syria where rebels of an increasingly More islamist stamp could stand before the Stürzung Bashar Assads, up to Jordan where Hamas allies threaten the king.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And especially the ascent of the Moslem fraternity under Präsident Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the country inhabitant strongest and most important Arabic with distance - at the southern flank of Israel persistently changed the balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot, who reigned Egypt to its slump 2011 for 30 years, had only little time for the Hamas over.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast to that the fraternity with the Hamas is intermarries and its leaders stronger of people views dependent.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could prove to be a participant, who cannot be squeezed out even by Israel and the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Israeli hardliners on the other hand let pull an opposed conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">Militarily seen is the Hamas no more danger.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli rocket defense system, "Iron cathedrals", was able to prove itself and were destroyed many of the Hamas rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">At least a while long more quietly will be able to sleep Israel.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic regard, the United States hold imperturbably at its position firmly. Many European countries responsibly made the Hamas for the newest force escalations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Israel issued, especially under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, it in last years well that ignored the peace process to large parts.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although rockets killed out of the Gaza strip since 2004 about 30 Israelis, the country remained relatively free of suicide attempts - not finally thanks to the barrier plants, that into the West Bank and therewith in the main parts of a contingent Palestinian country in stray. These protect expanded become the Jewish settlements, that were declared to be sure to be people illegal, however always further.</seg>
<seg id="31">Netanyahu stands there well. Its Likud party allied itself in the forefield of the choices on the 22nd of January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even more aggressive group.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why do also these cunning Palestinians pamper and leave an own country to them?</seg>
<seg id="33">Did if they have actually the control of the West Bank, they would become then not exactly like its comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip also rockets discharge?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, it is better to hold and to punish it behind the wall in chess, should venture it it to lift the heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail. Yet the Arabic spring could make them a stroke through the calculation.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists, who sit in Egypt and in other countries now at the power, remaining have, few for Israel, they will concentrate first of all on the difficulties in the own country.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defense budget of Israel is larger than that of its four Arabic neighbors together.</seg>
<seg id="38">A war with the local superpower will help the new Arabic governments hardly in the restoration of its economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">To reach that the pragmatic president Mursi got together itself with Barack Obama, around an armistice, a promising sign could be - and perhaps the start of a new era symbolize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also Israelis should think more long-termed.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the remaining Arabic world undertakes timid steps toward democratization, Palestinians are robbed further its self-determination right - a powder keg, that will explode undoubtedly one day in the Israeli occupied zones, exactly like this week a bus in tel Aviv exploded.</seg>
<seg id="42">The suppression undermines already now the democracy in the Jewish country, and with the growth of the Arabic population, this situation only will worsen.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bloody missions to the repression of the Hamas in the Gaza strip will demand over the years increasingly its diplomatic tribute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides require an impetus from outside</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The correct answer is that, that of the sensibler representatives of both sides, whom large part of the remaining world will represent and of this newspaper: Two countries with which Israel to security purposes lectures zones.</seg>
<seg id="46">That - for the near future small - hope exists therein that the armistice of outsides more influence to the execution of this solution grants.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt must stop jointly with Turkey and Qatar now the weapon deliveries into the Gaza strip and better positioned than ever before, expanded through zone exchange and a joint Jerusalem, to convince by the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish country on base of the boundaries of 1967.</seg>
<seg id="48">Outside Arabic nations should move also the Hamas and Fatah to a unification.</seg>
<seg id="49">Therewith would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian country than with the impending proposal on UN observer status.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Also Obama must contribute its part in addition to move Israel to negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="51">During its first tenure, it neglected the presentation of its own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Far removes seems in the white house it, as would be it just as a participation disinclined.</seg>
<seg id="53">Yet that is a deplorable, short-sighted perspective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States have an essential interest in a stable Near East.</seg>
<seg id="55">And in addition a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians belongs.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The laws first worldwide for uniform cigarette packaging and tobacco packaging stepped in Australia effective. Therewith Markenlogos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive covers, that are imprinted in addition with drastic pictures, which show sick body parts and through cigarette smoke sick babies and children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Of the different health warnings and pictures once seen exists the single difference between the packings in the brand name, that are printed in more identical, small writing, as of coming Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therewith Australia introduces the regulations most severe worldwide for tobacco packaging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian Federal Government wants to divert young people of the smoking in that the glamouröse picture of the tobacco consumption is removed.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the same time the government of studies goes out, that showed that people, who did not begin with 26 yet, to smoke,, with 99 %- iger probability also after that no longer begin become.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"One can already with children of young age see, that it the message understand, the tobacco groups with its brand-name picture to apply try", so federal health minister Tanya Plibersek. It quotes studies that showed for example, that children associate the crown of a Logos with the idea of a princess.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Although Australia shows one of the slightest smoker quotas of the world and the changes will affect only negligibly the profits of the multinational groups, other countries consider already similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">So it was named would be favored, with which laws the black market trade, what would go to cheap and more easily accessible cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The laws become serious, unintentional consequences lead", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer by far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Other on the other hand say that the laws boosted its business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notices in that the demand enormously increased after cigarette cases and silicone cover to the cover of the intolerable packaging, since the groups British American Tobacco, Britain's failed it imperially Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco of two months ago uppermost Australian court with its attack of the laws.</seg>
<seg id="16">Zico had sold and would wait up to 6,000 units at wholesale trade businesses for new supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, that is a good business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to expert is the hooks in the popularity of social media about exactly the population group, at which the plan arranges itself.</seg>
<seg id="19">A row of Australian laws banished tobacco groups out of the TV advertising, prohibits it them when sport sponsors to appear and forced most dealers in addition not to display cigarettes in businesses more long. Now the tobacco advertising is changed into the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government forbid Internet advertising through local businesses and sides, possesses however no influence on international sides.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Who tobacco markets and only a small area remaining has, around its products to apply, comes around the Internet not around", says Becky Freeman, researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman assessed a climb at reports to brands, that were composed by "entirely normal people".</seg>
<seg id="23">One must ask himself the question: Does the merely one private person, who find so large favor at Marlboro cigarettes, is receives, that it for that even a video - or has a marketing agency therewith to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry would concentrate instead of on marketing on that to explain itself with the new laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It even so far went, the Ukraine to pay Honduras and the Dominican Republic, to contest around the new regulations - those countries complain in the World Trade Organization about unjust trade restrictions although none of the countries operates larger trade with Australia.</seg>
<seg id="26">A WTO decision is expected for middle 2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">According to Plibersek the government of conversations with other countries led, that similar packaging laws consider.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada was 2001 the first country that prescribed photographic warnings.</seg>
<seg id="29">Meanwhile these were expanded on more than 40 countries, under that Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In a permanently galvanizeed world, it is beautiful, also to be bored once</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This Thanksgiving spent I unexpectedly five hours in the airport when our airplane out fell based on mechanical problems and we on another flyer wait must.</seg>
<seg id="3">I had therefore enough time in order to make myself a couple of thought to boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I do not want to lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">To wait a half day at the airport for a flight, is rather nerve-rackingly - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and naturally tax free shopping) are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But more and more academician and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">If it goes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be occasionally bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therewith the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting reasonings, what promotes if possible creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because that of us stare nowadays almost permanently on that on or other screen, benefit us the advantages of the boredom no longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Should we welcome the boredom therefore with open arms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">On that I return once again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">How many people also I assumed always that boredom of a relatively current phenomenon is, that developed with increasing leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="15">Yet Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and Roman story at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of "bora cathedral: A Lively History" (Yale University of press, 2011) that sees not so.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Actually has the boredom of a very long story", says it.</seg>
<seg id="17">A Latin graffiti adorns the house walls of Pompeii over boredom, that is due to the first century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then yet the question is there how we actually define boredom.</seg>
<seg id="19">John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of the psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada according to the problem exists therein that boredom was defined and discussed on types multifarious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After long reading material of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Eastwood and its colleagues to the end came professor that boredom as the experience, "a satisfying activity exercise to want, this however to can" cannot be defined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom differs of apathy consequently indicating that the person is not busied, this however be would like.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the apathy on the other hand there is no pressure to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The key experience of the boredom, says it, would exist in an "interference of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling, that the time only slowly passes".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can sound therewith almost so like depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But professor Eastwood believes although both conditions in context stand could, see bored people the problem in its environment or the world while depressive people see the problem in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we believe that is boring us, also if we have merely difficulties to concentrate.</seg>
<seg id="27">In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining bora cathedral in Terms of Attention" - to German about: "The idle intellect: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention", that appear in September in the trade journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", wise professor Eastwood and its colleagues on an earlier experiment there, with which participants listened a volume, on which a person read a magazine article.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard a loud television program out of the neighboring room, that had to do nothing with the contents. Others heard it on low volume so that it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The people who heard the hardly audible television, indicated to perceive more boredom than the two other groups - it had problems to concentrate, were able to find and wrote no reason for this its difficulties of the boredom to.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If one tries to concentrate on a difficult or strenuous task, the interference of the attention to boredom can lead, says mark J. Fenske, associated professor for neurosciences at the university Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">If one exercised on the other hand a monotonous activity - "so like the search for defective products on a factory conveyer belt, music can distract and help at the same time to not to feel" bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Actually, so it says, know even fight can we now that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln interprets, often as a sign for boredom, this in that people remain physically more attentively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Studies showed, that children, that herumhampeln may, more learn and more information retain than that, that for sitting still forced become", so professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">All becomes us at some time or another boring - my belated flight, a roaring loudspeaker, an especially tiring film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people bore themselves more easily than other.</seg>
<seg id="36">In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980 developed years a "scale to the boredom susceptibility".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On the scale, statements such as "many things that I must do be found repeat, themselves and are have monotonous" and "I so many interests that I have not" enough time for everything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">With the help of such scales, researchers found out, becomes that boy more often boring as a girl, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the university west Florida - especially, what concerns the requirement after more and a larger variety of external attractions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general teenagers are a rather exhausted pile.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, professor for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment carried out contacted, in that he almost 400 teenagers and its parents seven to eight times at the day with a Pager.</seg>
<seg id="41">It found out that 32% of the growing up were bored in the school and in the settling of the homework, whereas 23% indicated to be bored if they were not in the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Yet only 3% of the parents indicated to feel bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he would not know whether the percent shares climbed or sunk with respect to the boredom.</seg>
<seg id="44">Let he be certain however that "the youth as especially boring perceived becomes", mainly, because children and teenager have no large influence on its everyday life flow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Back therefore to my origin question: Is boredom healthy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes, for in the extreme case it does not lead in addition that people take extreme physical risks on itself and decay the gamble or drugs to mitigate around it - that showed studies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand many philosophers and authors examine the relation between boredom and creativity. Professor Vodanovich, that the subject investigates since more than two decades, is this opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"With the boredom wants the brain one say, that one something else do should", so Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain does not know always, what one should do just best.</seg>
<seg id="50">If one boringly is and one this energy uses in order to play and to cook guitar, becomes one happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">Yet television can provide to be sure short-termed for feelings of happiness, these evaporate long-termed however again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">He, who passes therefore an iPad to its bored child, can divert it therewith to be sure of the boredom. It did not learn therewith however to conversed or to control, says professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And it adds: "Self-control transfers itself of a situation to the other".</seg>
<seg id="54">The child learns not only to converse, but rather more self-control receives also in other areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also we should not see it to critically.</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead our goal should exist therein, well should feel us also to one side of the permanent activity irrigation and technology irrigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agrees that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"It sounds so, as would have to be more often boring us. But boredom is the tormenting, unceasing wish to do something meaningful", says it.</seg>
<seg id="60">It believes that the people in truth search only for a way, to disengage and to relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment, in which we permanently are stimulated over, to busy is difficult for it, itself if the noise is" upset once.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marihuana law</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The 19-year-old Community College student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands be becomes in the southeast Colorados for an offense before court, that in this country already soon legal: The possession of some less marihuana chunk and a pipe with which it smoked this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">According to Orozco it and some friends were at a September day with the car in Lamar near the boundary to Kansas underway when they were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officer had found marihuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalier offense, that respectively with a punishment of 100 U.S. dollars accommodated are - and received a court appointment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We become how criminal treats", so Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Is it but also one?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the country of legalizeing small quantities marihuana to the own use, depends the answer in hunderten of smaller drug offense fewer on the law, than of the location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of infringements that revolve around marihuana become here and in the Staate Washington, that similar measures approved, already fallengelassen.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police authorities does not pursue adult over 21 years more long for possession in small mass. This legally is allowed as soon as the new laws in the next weeks step effective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But district attorneys in the more conservative districts Colorados announced, existing marihuana offenses followiera and quote still people before court.</seg>
<seg id="11">To the same time, several cities vote, of the suburbs that verse to the Western Mountains about that to prevent from new, national licensed marihuana businesses the opening in its communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This situation develops so quickly further, that I not at does all know, what next happen becomes", says Daniel J. Oates, police boss in Aurora who lies east of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">And also regulating authorities in the state Washington scratch themselves helplessly at the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They wait for a guidance to the arrangement of a license system for the production, manufacture, the sales and marketing and the sale of the drug - and have at the same time a time period to the 1st of December 2013 before eyes.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Washington, one is the view that Colorado in every trap is most countries ahead, what concerns the regulation of marihuana. There the drug became first medical purposes and then to the own consumption legalizeed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more strongly regulated market. The country suits itself therefore well to the orientation", says smith Brian E., speaker of the regulatory agency for Spirituosen in the country Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But smith gives also to that no place or system can do more to serve than in the sense of a coarse clue.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent, that we follow can", joins it thereto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">That Washington law, I named-502, steps on the 6th of December effective and forms legalizes is therewith also the final point of a gray zone, in which the national license system exists to be sure not yet, but the possession.</seg>
<seg id="20">And unpleasant practice questions must be clarified in this time - about how the national specification of an "appropriate access" is supposed to be arranged to licensed marihuana with the ban by cannabis businesses in the vicinity by 300 meters around schools, park, playgrounds and child care arrangements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Nowhere becomes it be heavier, a location for a licensed cannabis business to find than in metropolitan areas, especially in the conurbation of Seattle", means Ben Livingston, speaker for that "center cannabis legal for", a research group formed recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On the 21st of November, Chief Oates sent its colleagues in Aurora an e-mail in which he explained, the district attorney not more long would pursue smaller marihuana offenses with people over 21 years, and that the police would strive for "from immediately" no punishment notices for these offense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates added that the police would put through further municipal specification to the regulation of Anbauern of medical marihuana and drug dealers would be pursued further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County in the north Colorados, district district attorney Ken represents baked a more severe view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the voting, it indicated would pursue, its authority cases of marihuana possession further, mainly in order to move consumer to the withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="26">Up-to-date 119 people for the possession of about 50 grams or less marihuana must answer to court although many were accused also for other offenses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our authority has the duty, offences to pursue, with which it itself to the deed moment around criminal offenses acted", let baked be reported in an explanation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions are even at places such as the rural Mesa County where voters rejected the marihuana initiative, conflicting.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, does not indicate adult for the possession of smaller quantities more long.</seg>
<seg id="30">District district attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided however also in addition to not let fall all being outstanding possession procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I believe not, that I my time therewith would waste, the right to prevail, until it changes", says it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, was already from the beginning clear that it would not be simple to arrange the personal consumption of marihuana with the complexities of government and right system.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the contradictory reactions in the entire country promoted a far-reaching discrepancy under local official with regard to the large green experiment too days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">With district district attorneys would concern it one "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer out of Denver, that for marihuana offense before court standing accused represents and acts on the spot as a speaker for the national organization to the reform of marihuana laws.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"You have a so large part of its life therewith spent, people for that criminal to pursue, that it the legalization still do not accept can", believes it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first country, the smaller quantity marihuana such as alcohol treat, are been Colorado and Washington as national pattern cases for the legalization about drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">While champion and country official prepare themselves for an age of legal sale, they wait simultaneously also nervously for directions of the Federal Government, which wants to treat the sale and the annex of marihuana on federal level further as a criminal offense.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Champions of the legalization movement hope that the justice ministry will give way.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Federal Government allowed marihuana medical in spite of several sensation exciting arrests by consumer and salesmen the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries to the large part.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Kevin A. Sabet, earlier drug politics adviser of the Obama government is the view that criminalist will enter to be sure probably no doors in order to seize smaller quantities of the drugs, itself however probably sträuben become to tolerate the marihuanas businesses legal, nationally regulated under the new legislation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several cities in Colorado wait first not at all on that that the federal authorities act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yet the election day ago some local community administrations approved moratoriums for new marihuanas businesses although these could open not until about a year.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban that is dismissed probably next week concluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We would want not into a position run, with which we someone license and then on federal level before a large problem stand", quaked Nicholson, member of the city advice.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community agreed against this change in the law.</seg>
<seg id="46">We do not arrange ourselves after that, for which the community decided, and after that, for which the country decided.</seg>
<seg id="47">Yet many questions are open.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford because I am Tory</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only university students of today are attacked for its views</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Already always it had been my largest dream to received a place at the university Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, that I considered once to be the largest white stamp of the world, for a modern Greek Symposion, that promoted the large columns of the civilization - free thinking and tolerance -.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Yet within two weeks after my entrance in the Worscester College end of the eighty - there had I intended, story to study -, I had packed again my suitcases and had induced so the first scandal of my life.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father collapsed in tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the Evening standard, it was named would have gone, I because I would have had a problem therewith, that fellow student in the neighboring room sexes had.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author A N Wilson declared impish, I the university would have left because I was forced in addition to drink out of damaged cups.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth however was less amusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, ran suffered, for I from systematic Mobbing and threats.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not based on my quite unusual by the name of, or because I had come of a private school.</seg>
<seg id="14">One had tormented me only for a reason - a reason, that seemed in this alleged cradle of the enlightenment the more narrow and crueler: My father deceased meanwhile Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser Margaret Thatchers and I advocate of the conservative party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why do I mention this just now?</seg>
<seg id="16">According to now, current reports a new generation of students of the moderated rights suffers from similar pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford developed meanwhile such dimensions that a group of them demanded last week the same equality protection, that gay, hindered and ethnic minorities of benefit comes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christ College indicate, they become "often actively isolated based on its political views, personally are attacked and declares" to be undesirablely.</seg>
<seg id="19">They demand a place in the equality committee of its College in order to guarantee that its opinions can be expressed free.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Aggravated its situation became through a documentation radiated recently over political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", that represented Tories as an Exzentriker and Neonazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">Therein shown became graduate Joe Cooke, earlier president the conservative student-like union the university among other things Oxford that went in a roll Royce and showed off with silberfarbenem suit and silver occupied walking stick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities, conservative students say be regarded, it as a "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".</seg>
<seg id="23">The hatch 20-year-old looked, vice president of the conservative student union of the university Nottingham, let be reported in a Sunday newspaper: "There is some growing links tendency at universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people believe, we are like the Bullingdon club to have become acquainted with without us generally".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christs, that the petition initiated for larger protection, is the view, such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student-like union of Oxford says, it would be right with JCR members a growing rejection vis-à-vis students of the moderated observes.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This places a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members there", says it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I had arrived in September 1986.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred of the conservative party had reached its highpoint.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the preceding year, the university had agreed for that to lend Margaret Thatcher - an earlier student - on the basis of abridgments in the high school system no honorary title.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would have startle let even Stalinisten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of the first semester week, with which new students meet and the tutors, I received a foretaste on the future events.</seg>
<seg id="33">I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but rather participated even with joys on that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political subjects such as the miner strikes, the denationalization and the rejection of the government of sanction against the Apartheid of regime South Africa found its way into the holzgetäfelten rooms of the Tutoriums.</seg>
<seg id="35">In my first of these organizations, I should translate French texts out of the 18th century into the English. On that, what should come then, I had not been calm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (meanwhile deceased), "translate you please the first paragraph".</seg>
<seg id="37">I stumbled at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt was a small man with a face such as out of cake dough, and rather hateful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Do Thatcher followers "refuse to learn French, or they are simply only stupid"?, asked he me.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students giggled.</seg>
<seg id="41">In my eyes, tears boiled.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I strike before, that it in your leisure time a couple of French hours take - therefore, if you not too very with your social activities busied are", knurrte me Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned with hanging head into my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">At this evening I sat in the College alone in the supper when someone typed me easily on the shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was an English student out of the second year by the name of James who imagined as a member of the conservative student-like union.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I knows, who you are", said it friendlily.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately it is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Every that is suspected to be Tory, is tormented.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me, it is already bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher near stands, therefore it will be worse for you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most Tory first semesters purport to be follower of the Labour party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In a local pub tried I later to block me.</seg>
<seg id="52">I existed on that that I not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion was.</seg>
<seg id="53">This trick should as unsuccessful prove itself.</seg>
<seg id="54">A study beginner in the specialty philosophy, politics and economy, that ironic would prove visited had that as a conservatively valid Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".</seg>
<seg id="55">You for hours.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students divided its opinion.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was perverse and dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How do Tories sex" have?, asked me one.</seg>
<seg id="59">Do that strike itself mutually, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt so how homosexual had to have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="61">Would it ever succeed me to lead a normal life at the university Oxford?</seg>
<seg id="62">Would I be able to encounter like-minded first after break-in of the darkness?</seg>
<seg id="63">Should I must turn to the Labour party and suppress my natural inclinations?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years that lay before me extended in my mind's eye to a sweep ivy of the ostracism and isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The single tutor, that gave to recognize itself openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, professor for contemporary story, that had its seat in my College.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was hated not only for that to be a conservative, but rather also because it had advised Thatcher in things foreign policy and had written for it speeches.</seg>
<seg id="67">It was only rare there.</seg>
<seg id="68">It hated the place, found it provincial and narrow-minded and leaned it for its Marxist deterministic Geschichtsperspektive off.</seg>
<seg id="69">It supposed 1997 a professorship at the university Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You become here not happy become", said it me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open friends and members of the family in the city.</seg>
<seg id="72">My father told I that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">It seemed unbelieving.</seg>
<seg id="74">During its time in the Vierzigern, all political views were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it is the best place in the world", said it subdued.</seg>
<seg id="76">They never would do so something, not in my city of the dreaming tower tip.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my communist friends put always flawless manner at the day.</seg>
<seg id="78">Its damp eyes clouded themselves.</seg>
<seg id="79">Gib the entire a chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am certain, one teases you only.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break me the heart if you went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausts through my frequent trips after London became my emotional resistance weaker.</seg>
<seg id="83">One of my masculine friends, also Tory follower, had given way the pressure and renounces its convictions.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">For four Euro, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano set its life and its health on the game if they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky ways.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">There are work people, for whom its work is the hell, and others literal in the hell.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the case in Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers that earn itself its life, in that they get sulfur out of the volcano Kawah Ijen in the East of the Indonesian island java.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition it must climb down every day on the ground of its crater where the gas streaming out sulphurous out of the earth in the contact with the air hardens itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">After it broke out here large sulfur stones, that can weigh altogether up to 70 kilos, it transports it in two bamboo baskets on its shoulders over the steep paths out of stone.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only 250 meters are to be sure to the tip of the volcano, that rises into a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent in the turtle speed whereby they must retain the balance and carefully must set its steps so that they do not slip and crash.</seg>
<seg id="8">They know that every step can cost its life, how this happened to a French tourist, who crashed years ago at the steep cliff of the Kawah Ijen.</seg>

<seg id="12">That sells it then for 10,000 rupees apiece (83 Euro cents) at the petrochemical industry because this mineral in the everyday life is widespread and is used to the manufacture of matches, fireworks articles, cosmetic, dynamite and even to the lead of sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"There we normally 70 kg carry, receive we for every ways approximately 46,000 rupee (3.8 Euro)", explains Anto, that in the normal case three stretches makes at the day, to us.</seg>
<seg id="14">For each stretch, it required three hours according to what it is created totally, at the end of the day has it however then 138,000 rupees (11.5 Euro) together.</seg>
<seg id="15">What looks like a miserable wage for one such exertion sheerly inhuman, is however the triple of that, what it would earn with the field work.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The day wage of the mine workers here, where in the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euro) at the day paid become and the average monthly income two million rupees (167 Euro) amounts to, is very high", clarifies the carrier, that as a mason on the tourist island previously Bali worked.</seg>
<seg id="17">There it earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 Euro) at the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with its family after Banyuwangi, a village in the vicinity, returned, and that for a reason, that is in Indonesia as important as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduisten, and I brought it after java in order to convert" it to Islam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs are excited frequently and its eyes because of the poisonous gases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The 27 year-old Anto has set for three years its life at the Kawah Ijen on the game, whose sulfur left behind in that it already the first traces, although it uncovers its face with a costume and special glasses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs are excited frequently and its eyes because of the poisonous gases out of the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is the price that it must pay for the reaching of its dream.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I become here yet two years work, because I a store open or Spanish or French learn would like", promises it in one more than an only acceptable English.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This sympathetic and intelligent, but of life punished young man could work performs as a tourist leader, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he the work of a deceit donkey.</seg>
<seg id="24">He divides himself a dirty wood cottage with other carriers and stands every morning at two o'clock up because the sulfur out streams also at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the darkness shines bluish.</seg>
<seg id="25">The shadows demanding, climbs he in the light of a small forehead lamp at its helmet, that he bought himself of its own money, in the crater.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Approximately 400 carriers load themselves at the crater ground the baskets with sulfur on its shoulders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In spite of its large profits, the mine company did not mechanize delivers the sulfur dismantling in order to save costs, and to the carriers, who work on own calculation and are paid after weight, no equipment at all.</seg>
<seg id="28">They receive also no share in the 30,000 rupee (2.5 Euro) extra charge per camera, that the guards of this nature reserve demand together the amount with the entrance fee in of 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euro) of the tourists, who come for photographing the volcano and the human deceit donkeys.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="30">It is in a position to carry up to 110 kg and assures that it continues, "as long as it goes" because it needs the money for the upbringing of its three children in the age between 10 and 18 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">I will not go in pension, I will die here because the volcano was my entire life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Even if the sulfur burns the throats and the eyes itch, if the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers in the thick columns clamps, who climb out of the crater, the men are complains so hard, that no one about heavy illnesses... naturally except the usual breath problems, Arthrose, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, that shaped itself of the weight of the baskets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">With the basket on its back, Unainik with its 53 years nurmehr in a position is, to carry 50 kg.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">It appears incredulously that the verses part of an advertising are for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless - or just therefore - they became at the beginning this year in Singapore a viral video on YouTube.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The sentences are part of a Rapper song, the local saying such as for example "pushing becomes a" bao" (loaf) into the oven in order to make themselves over the low birth rate in Singapore amusingly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The hope the advertise firm BBH that turned the video, preserves that the advertisement reaches on funny type and manner to make aware of the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Your creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of the music in addition to bring the people in addition, fulfill its "national duty".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">This is somewhat only for the Internet, therefore we must it amusingly and witty form.</seg>
<seg id="10">It concerns the largest problem in this country.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the reproducing, we are the worst of the world, therefore we noticed that it concerns a subject, around which we had to worry us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We knew that the government had tried much, like for example the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of Speed-Dating-evening (fast flirt).</seg>
<seg id="13">Possible, that many of these ideas were creative, it led however not compelling to the success.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore we thought: Why shall we not make somewhat as creatively as possible in order to concern this problem, to compose like for example a Rap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">1.2 Children</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">He who not easily takes this subject, is the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each year issues it 1,300 U.S. dollars for political measures in order to encourage the citizens, to get more children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A package of the government for married couple and parents grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends the motherhood vacation and distributes fiscal advantages.</seg>
<seg id="19">But everything had previously little success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Singapore is a rich, highly technological city state in the southeast of Asia that is well known also for the conservatism of its reigning and its strict social inspections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is presently about 1.2 children per woman.</seg>
<seg id="22">The last time when this rate - what also as a substitution rate well known is - was amounted to over 2 in the year 1976.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Therefore why get the Singapurer no longer children?</seg>
<seg id="24">Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage politics and family politics of the national population authority, says that this is to be attributed to a "better education" and "larger career chances".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"This has the person enables, except to marry and a family to form substantially more option with regard to life goal to have and priorities to set", explains it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">These changes in the social facts contributed to the higher number at single and at the out hesitation of the marriage and births, whose result the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the meantime an immigration politics, that aims on a drastic climb of the immigrations, led in order to work against the reduction of the population, to resentment at the local population.</seg>
<seg id="28">In Singapore, there are blooms web pages, where the hardly concealed Xenophobie against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for that, that they hold the wages low and do not integrate itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The climb of the immigration is looked at also as one of the reasons that the party in power in Singapore obtained last year its worst choice result since the independence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the choices, an attempt was undertaken to correct the problem with higher contributions and duties for foreign workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Unexpected consequences</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">During the falling birth rate the well known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the tax collections, that has health costs and the immigration politics, the example shows consequences also unexpected Singapore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">To reach the government tried that so many small dwellings are not constructed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">So it has already also effects on the housing market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The authority for municipal development began therewith to control the number at small suite, that are as a "shoe boxes" well known and may be constructed in certain zones of the city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">These suites have a living space of 46 square meters and show a large sale success.</seg>
<seg id="37">To be sure the worry exists that they can promote the lifestyle of the single, and that they deter the construction companies therefrom to construct large dwelling for families.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But Lim Yew Soon, general director of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that its "shoe boxes" can be sold very much faster than larger housing units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">They are so popular, and the units are around days and even weeks faster sold out as the larger housing units.</seg>
<seg id="40">This leads in addition that they are better for our cash Flow very much.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It admits to be sure that the new standards give the developer clearer orientations, which previously hindrances were put into the way, if they wanted to construct too many small housing units within a project.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much stress</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Even if these new rules could prepare the way to a climb of the national birth rate, to take is the conversations with the Singapurern, that work in the finance quarter, that they will have no large effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"The people are are postponed becomes" says strongly gestresst, the dwellings and also the upbringing expensive, why it by many a young manager.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The children can get others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"For me, it is says important to control" my own money and time another, approximately twenty years man old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Men and women cite its career, that stress and the costs for the property and the upbringing as reasons for that that they can have no children.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Therefore the Singapurer have the last word if it goes therefore to got children - there can do the government yet so much.</seg>

<seg id="1">"South America must in the integration of the citizens learn", says Rafael Correa</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a joint country citizenry is a goal, whereby "South America can" learn actually something of Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Correa, that participated on the 6th summit meeting of the presidents of the union South American nations (Unasur), that in Lima took place, explained the national television in Peru that the Europeans "in the second world war and in other discussions killed" themselves and are" "today practically a homeland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In this sense defended it the project to create a South American country citizenry, that the member countries of the Unasur push.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Reached will must the free traffic of the citizens and worker in all South American countries, like this already in the Andes partnership the case is it gives to be sure yet reactionary sectors, the one return into the past strive for", warned he.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The president Ecuadors advocated moreover the reorganisation of the organization of American countries (OEA) under the specification to diminish the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to consider that, that have signs the agreement of San José over human rights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">That that teach never promise to something, and in return in addition we sign the South Americans always all.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is incomprehensible, that the interamerikanische commission for human rights its seat in Washington has and of the United States financed becomes", declared it as an allusion on the political asylum, that granted Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Correa assured that it would not regret this decision, because it had not betrayed therewith its principles, but rather would be come later its "deep democratic values and views over human rights".</seg>
<seg id="10">It added that there had been at that time "established suppositions, that Assange delivered at a third country and its procedure would not become" kept.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It criticized moreover the Swedish justice that had demanded by it to subject it on its country zone because of an alleged sexual offense to an interrogation while "the Swedish jurisdiction permits this by means of a video conference, that over the message Ecuadors in London would have carried out will can".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Correa explained that the danger would exist, that the health and the psychic condition would be impaired by Assange.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since then he herself in our message finds, have I not with it spoken, the ambassador has me to be sure informs, that he an easy problem with the lungs has, but no serious", said the country chief Ecuadors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The danger exists to be sure that it would take physical and psychic damage, because it would be caught in a narrow room and could carry out no physical practices in the free.</seg>
<seg id="15">"That would become the health of every person impair", joined he thereto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Correa indicated that the solution for the asylum, that was granted Assange for the month of June in the message Ecuadors in London, that would be granting of a license, wherewith it could travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juristic authorities Europe it. It unterstrich that it had given with London of conversations in order to find a solution for the locked in founder of WikiLeaks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">We do not act with the human rights, we do not turn this word for this case on, there had been to be sure permanent conversations.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The solution for this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the juristic authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a row of procedure on different European instances leads", explained he.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">And "if Great Britain grants morning this license, this is settled" according to my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">And if Sweden of Mr. Assange interrogated on the message Ecuadors in London or over Skype, how it allows the Swedish jurisdiction and was made in other cases, would be settled the problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Correa used the opportunity in order to be confirmed as a defender of the press freedom and said that that what he would not tolerate, "the mediocrity, that bad intention and the lie are, that the freedom of speech weaken".</seg>
<seg id="22">"The largest enemies of the press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but rather bad journalists, that after profit strive and blackmail", said he.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In this sense congratulated he herself that Ecuador ahead did not take no longer "and also of the banks or hegemonic and spear middle class countries controlled becomes" of such journalists, and, that he will deepen "the revolution in a re-election in order to continue" the way into this correct direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Correa supported also the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least to its next choices whereby it argued, that the organisms became" "hard remain must and no opportunism and no as legal disguised country stroke grant may", because through it "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay destroyed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The president Ecuadors considers moreover the wish of its Colombian opposite, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the international court of the Hagues, that divided before the maritime country highness of Nicaragua, to negotiate the lake legal boundaries between both countries with Nicaragua, to be "absolutely entitles".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Presently this judgment is not transferred.</seg>
<seg id="27">It concerns a problem between one South American and a Central American country.</seg>
<seg id="28">Conflicts are unavoidable, they must be overcome however in the striving after a joint way.</seg>
<seg id="29">They must be treated comprehensively so that one can overcome it and can view forwards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Just as it trusted on a good conclusion of the disputes over the lake boundaries between Peru and Chile before the same court and meant that "it is correct for Latin America to call international instances if both countries promise to suppose the judgment even if it very hard precipitates".</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">With regard to the possibility that he stands as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to reach its third mandate in consequence, indicated he that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it also very heavily falls" sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Correa assured that, if it would lose the choices in February 2013, it out of the political life withdraw would become.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Power never interested me personally, but under so unjust circumstances such as in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can be corrected only by the political power.</seg>
<seg id="34">"My political movement had the belief, that I it was, that this probable victory guaranteed, therefore must I this responsibility come later", said it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If I should win, it would be retract me my last period as a president, after that I out of the public life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cause for a dying because of Aids is today a too late recognition</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when one it the test result confirmed: HIV positively.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was, as if a bomb hit", says it over the moment, in which it received the diagnosis "to reduce that the physician without recognizable success tried".</seg>
<seg id="4">It hid it before its family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He concluded to attend alone to its illness and began therewith to inform itself about that; and this with such use that he celebrated just its 43rd birthday.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is came doubtless one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in that he after several fights 1994.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio has lived with the humane Immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years, what at the beginning the '90's was heavily conceivable, when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more stigmas.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time it itself avoided the director of a clinic of the IMSS to take leave, "because it into a dead end led".</seg>
<seg id="9">At that time AIDS was synonymous for death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="11">To be sure many people come yet always into the clinic, that know nothing of its illness and with which the virus already damage caused, and its immune system exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, i.e. after appearance of the first reported cases, "means the large success today, that the survival of a patient, that the treatment on time receives, and the survival of the general population exact same are", explained the leader of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, whereby he said, that this information had been supported in April this year of an esteemed scientific publication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The expert for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented on that the scientists have concluded since the year 2008, that AIDS would be to be sure no death sentence, that however the years of the survival would depend and the quality of life on the degree of the impairment of the immune system the people in start of the treatment, and that that larger chance would have, that are not drug-addicted: up to 30 years in a counting of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a counting Of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply said, mean the above-mentioned executions that, who HIV positively receives at the age of 25 years the diagnosis, in this sense "problem-free 75 years old will can, as long as it under control stands", explained this expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In order correctly to be able to incorporate this progress, must be remembered on that that the life expectancy the mexican amounts to today on the average 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Even if the mortality in the past years significantly diminished has (in Mexico has itself the number of the people, that at AIDS die, of 6,678 cases per year 2007 on 4,862 in 2011 (year report of the ONUSIDA) diminished itself), is it nevertheless correct that since the appearance of the AIDS 60 of percent the patient grasped in the national database died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alone in Jalisco died are in 2011,255 people, and to the month of May of this year it already 187 deaths; to be sure is assured that there has been since 2005 universal access to the antiretroviralen medicines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- Why do people die therefore yet always on that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- Do not mean is according to opinion the problem the access to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is is my opinion, and so in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the past 12 years, we had no provision problems in the medicines. The problem is that the people come in far advanced condition, because they do not know its infection condition, i.e. in very late phases of the illness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It makes a striking statement: "Nine of ten patients come to us if they have already an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, are offered will must more premature diagnoses required, why, massively recognition tests" to all people with whom this is required.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The specialists and official of the Consejo Estatal agree this suggestion de Prevención del Sida e Jalisco (Coesida) (more nationally from shot to the AIDS avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio, that let carry out its test in a private laboratory, and this out of the single reason because it a friend of it had made, was that in spite of its young age already in the AIDS phase and had even the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancer-like tumor) What is one of the usual complication.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything is differently if you know, that you have AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they will die, and would want do nothing hear.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I already die must, then rather three times burst", says one in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The change was to that there improvement, I eat good, drive sport and would take the medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today his parents know only that it had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like every other also.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, would undertake much, would have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person", itemizes Fabrizio, that agreed to divide its intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to animate with its testimony that, that have today anxiety in the frame of the worldwide AIDS day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know, whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, should learn it how one can live like all people responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its message is a summary of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condom behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Between the health programs and the simple citizen consist large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara, that took on the thing of the HIV.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the most important is the prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the places certain in addition "became the distribution by condom actually increases; earlier became it individually delivered, now give it us packages with hundred pieces, what is already good, it gives however yet always people, that no access to a condom have", said he.</seg>
<seg id="37">To the risk people for new infections, the youths count.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Why do you need that"? is a common mockery question of social workers, orientation personnel in schools, employee in pharmacies and in the health system that youths not would like to stop itself, the correspondent assured.</seg>
<seg id="39">It proposed to orient this inefficient distribution newly; the condoms should be not only behind the counter, but rather in edition devices in public toilets of arrangements, that are visited frequently by youth.</seg>
<seg id="40">The promiscuity is not supposed to be promoted.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is not supposed to be paid them the beer and motel how the governor Emilio González answered on the question, whether under its administration condoms would become distributed.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Sexuality sees so not from; best is it, that condom that more closely to bring, the already one sexual activity exercise", brought it it on the point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key data of Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There are 13,435 cumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIVS).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The country lies nationally seen at 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and at 13th place with regard to HIV.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">92% of the contagion cases take place via sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2% perinatal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">It is appreciated that 50,000 people live with HIV, because it gives for every registered case 4 or 5 people, who do not know it.</seg>

<seg id="7">Actually the model law of the United Nations was created to this purpose for the unification of the international commercial law whereby that of American Law institutes was used as simpler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Secondly the judgment determines that without the voices of the companies after recognition of the obligations in the bankruptcy mass, that had the branch of Vitro with its mother company, the required majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the obligations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">To be sure this possibility is acknowledged of the Mexican laws.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Is correct moreover that after deduction of the voices of the branch the creditors of Vitro, who creditor, who in the courts of the United States against Vitro complained, i.e. the vultures funds such as for example Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and live pool Limited, no majority reached would have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The voting would have gone out 45 percent against 37 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This is not considered of the court of appeal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the other hand there is Vitro guilt for its difficult situation from 2008 in the frame of the large economic crisis in the United States, that gave the country of blows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For this reason the family González Sada inserts contradiction before the same court of appeal so that the voting follows, i.e. from all judges, in the plenum because only three voted therefrom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Becomes not that granted, is inserted the Cerciorare objection, that demands the examination of the procedure by a higher instance, in this case by the colonel court of the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The serious at this case is that the court let a document aside, that was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), wherein the procedure carried out by Vitro in the frame of the law is described over trade bankruptcy, and is referred wherein on that, that it strictly at that of both countries signed come off held had itself in order to to correspond to the chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The Weltenbummler of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected the basket sport more long than a 60 years and has the entire world bereist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few in Puerto Rico control the country such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes a so large intellectual collection of the story of the basketball.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Before it was tied by a stroke in 2008 to the wheelchair, Rexes was for 6 years part of this sport, would be it as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, authorized and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"My life long have I me in the basketball many hats mounted, even several simultaneously, when I president of the BSN, principal director of the national team and president of the association in the '90's was", remembered Reyes in a visit of Primera Hora with it at home in Bayamón where he lives with Isabel, its loyal wife since more than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes does not exaggerate with these statements.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of its house are decorated and attest almost all with photos and memories of its long career it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The most emotional memories are that, that remind one of its time in the Vaqueros of the middle of the '50's as a player until 1982, where he celebrated its 15-year-old anniversary as a with manager or manager of the club.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Those were my best years, that I wetted at the most, because I part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 it would be be might as a manager, with manager or trainer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many fulfilling years were, including the five championship one after another of 1971 until 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I took leave with a championship 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From then, "Cuco" Ortiz, that received was a very good administrator", says Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I know yet that gene Bartow, that worked here as a trainer and was engaged at the university of Alabama (Birmingham), said me: "I have a very strong and 2 ms large player.</seg>
<seg id="16">Would you like it"?</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that ever had Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow recommended after that the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse that let become established and was one of our best throwers.</seg>
<seg id="19">I know yet how it said, that, if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for a further provide would become.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted it, but already out of a distance because it stood 1988 already at uppermost place of the association.</seg>
<seg id="21">To this time, it preferred it to enjoy its execution and that of Mincy in the national team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I know yet when we won for the first time in the before Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.</seg>
<seg id="23">After that the world championship 1990, with which we covered the fourth place, came, what actually bronze should have been, if this Canadian arbitrator had not been, who let repeat us the last playing style for the second time, Reyes said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Was this group of the world championship 1990 the best national team that you ever saw?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It belongs to the best how also that that won in the Olympic Games 2004 against the Dream team.</seg>
<seg id="26">My favorite is however the team of the panamerikanischen games 1991 in Cuba where we won gold and offered a battle to the team of the USA how at that time, when they won against us in the world championship bronze.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were again there, but rather also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, that brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, that 1990 was not able to be because of a knee injury there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">That a team, that was not perhaps with regard to personalities the best with which we won however a gold medal, and the joy large us prepared, was the before Olympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blocked players because of the incidents on the Panamerikanischen games in Mar del Plata, won we contrary to every prognosis the gold medal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">That was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its numbers on plain of the international tournaments are impressively.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico dominated on this plain so like Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this without considering its course in the different leagues, in which it played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best trainer out of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">That is a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a row of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of the boys pleases me the work of Leo Arill good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you believe is the best what you reached in the association?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">I was part of the most successful era of the national team of 1988 to 1995 that comprised the BSN at the beginning the '90's up to 17 teams in a season.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What remains to be done you yet?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things that I would have introduced, like for example the regionalization of the lower categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">That the boys in Ponce play for example only in its zone and encounter not until the national Playoffs on teams out of other corners of the island.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today the children make unnecessarily many trips and games.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the result of the prescribed educations and courses for trainer, table official and arbitrator.</seg>
<seg id="46">On that I am proud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What do you make today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I hear gladly music, would see videos of music of my time in YouTube, would enjoy my grandchilds and occasionally I go to a basketball game.</seg>
<seg id="49">And naturally I enjoy the company my wife Isabel that was always at my side.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">Each semester if the religion professor concluded to hold off a course over the end of the world, knew he that he controlled an irresistible hinge hook: the end of the "long backwards counting" of the Maya calendar on the 21st of December, of which many people believed, that it would mean the end of the world.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">But Charmé had no idea, what should expect it in the following both months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, that some designated as a "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict under participation of Israel, that place, of which the Christian theorists believe, that the apocalypse begins.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"I did not notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester, that it ever gave" said Charmé this week the student at the university Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).</seg>
<seg id="6">If someone analyzes, what happened today in the world, as if we would be removed thirty days therefrom, would be this an actual good period.</seg>
<seg id="7">And it remembers that that is bad good for that with apocalyptic mentality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">And it is not the single professor that this semester offers, that should be actual the last in the story, courses over the "end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In Temple, the sitting in professor Barry Vacker gives the course "media, culture and the end of the world".</seg>
<seg id="10">Each week the students examine apocalyptic subjects such as for example the atom war, Zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"We analyze, why itself these ideas gradually spread", said it, as well as the type and manner how hypothetical scenarios are offered, that lead to a certain human behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">If nuclear material arrives into the hands of terrorist, a war could break out for example.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The students analyzed this month films with apocalyptic contents and examined, compare to compare let itself how it in that the actual life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I have tries, the students about that to inform, what possible, is probable, plausible and impossible", said Vacker.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">On the head campus of the university Pennsylvania the professor formed a team for Latin American story Matthew Restall and its colleague Amara Solari, a sitting in professor for art story and anthropology in order to offer a course with the simple label "the end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We take 2012 not up, so that we always the option retain, the course newly hold off to can, for the case, that the world does not sink", said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In spite of the "impending downfall", the students must study, must generate projects and participate in final exam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In Penn State, the final exam is carried out at the eve of the apocalypse why the students have no other chance, when "to the night to continue work on, where the world nominally to end goes", said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The courses were chosen very.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"In two hours, there were said no more places" Restall over its course for students with high average, who filled himself with 35 students.</seg>
<seg id="21">For weeks before beginning of the semester we received e-mails of students that asked, whether yet places would be free.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The students on their part assure that the course is among the most interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">"It fascinating is to be seen, what the people do, around itself to comfort", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for religion and sociology out of Haddonfield, New Jersey.</seg>

<seg id="26">"Never have I something of an instruction belongs, where this instructed becomes", gave it on.</seg>
<seg id="27">I enjoy it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">But none of the questioned students - and fewer another professor - explained to believe in the last date of the 21st of December.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayas, and on certain type and manner discredit we it", said Julie Zeglen, student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and out of west Chester.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it concerns only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It notices in to be sure that in the western company an apocalyptic anxiety exists, that leads back several centuries, when the people on changes in its environment with the prediction of the end of the world reacted.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Internet increased these speculations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Other place think the people not so", says he.</seg>

<seg id="35">Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor of the university La Salle, that this year instructs on the Philippines, answers quickly on the question whether he would know there a course over the "end of the world".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"The Philippines be involved not in the end of the world", wrote it as a hint on an exception of a higher instance.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have a pardon of the pope.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Restall referred on that that over the years many days was spoken by the last court, and said that if on the 21st of December does nothing happen, "the people immediately at a new date think" or about the fact philosophized that the 21st of December would be the start of a seven year old period, according to what the end of the world would come.</seg>
