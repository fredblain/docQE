Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who exclaims an annual survey on the most outrageous bank charges, has this year decided to hold the contest "absurd idea or regulation from the EU - Workshop".
"This gave us the idea recently put forward by the EU plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organization of this survey, the newspaper Pravo.
Among the nominees absurdities, for example, is the judgment of the European Court on the Unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women in life insurance enjoyed an advantage because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
" More incredible ideas from the EU - Workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote is then up to the end of February 2013, " Nacher said.
To the controversial EU regulations is inter alia the mandatory blending of bioethanol fuel that is naturally harmful in its impact, the further the prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometer, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, essentially because of this year eggs were more expensive.
Critical praise in the past, the de facto ban of the use of the term "butter spread" or even banning the sale of incandescent light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 inches long
The EU apparatus is often decisive, under the pressure of this or that lobby of Trade and Industry, whose claims are represented in Brussels usually of one or more Member States (as the Czech Republic is currently trying for example to enforce with veto threat demands Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas the highest classification in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have any "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended it by arguing that it merely harmonize the disparate national standards that would hamper trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables were softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries are already pointing out that the previous policy would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU directive of last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons on the sale by pointing out that children are not allowed to inflate the balloon without adult supervision under eight years.
The EU on the basis that an American study, the balloons are the leading cause of death by asphyxiation of the children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
Curious ideas are at home
Relatively absurd is also a policy that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and FYROM have to say instead (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of laissez faire liberal economists addition to the above Absurdities of the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies to the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus firmly put the maximum volume of food stocks, which could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
Czech Republic exceeded then e.g. the fixed volume of preserved mushrooms, for which we threatened a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or to give the idea, funding for applications for funding.
These ideas came certainly not from Brussels but from Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will ask the EU refund, "explained the fall of 2004, the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument, he noted that the grain harvest was very high and the state warehouse due to so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded.
Since the Czech Republic have another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us loud Palas.
The European Commission finally came against the Czech Republic so far that they organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered to municipalities to the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically it should be of medium to To Set Up A funding requests money to Brussels.
EU : Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily earned in the member countries the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to development effectiveness and the European Union according to some experts but rather recognition.
A more serious problem is the opinion of these experts rather the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but were forced in the budget negotiations of individual member countries.
Calls forth emotions in this country and the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and must not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the term "olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six -year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), with a tradition with us until the 19th Century goes back, but had to rename our manufacturers in "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beets.
In the official list of registered products in the EU dive in the company of world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham now also on the Carlsbad rusks, carp Pohořelice and Trebon, or the Saaz hops.
With an EU trademark the Pardubice gingerbread or Hořice roles can boast since.
