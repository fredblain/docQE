In a constantly electrified world, it is good to be bored sometimes
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport when our plane failed and we had to wait for another plane due to mechanical problems.
So I had enough time to give me some thoughts on boredom.
I will not lie.
To wait half a day at the airport on a flight that is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead to boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay, occasionally to be bored.
Thus, the brain is forced to lose interest in trains of thought, which perhaps encourages creativity.
And because most of us these days almost constantly stare at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome with open arms of boredom?
And.
And no.
I will come back again.
Like many people, I always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has grown with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom : A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it that way.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of the houses of Pompeii graffiti adorns a Latin of boredom that goes back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, according to the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After much reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that define boredom as the experience of "wanting to pursue a satisfying activity, but this is not to" be.
Boredom is different from apathy accordingly the effect that the person is not employed, but this would be.
When apathy, however, there was no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, there was a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly".
Boredom can listen to it almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, though these two conditions might be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we think that 's boring us, even if we only have difficulty concentrating.
In their study "The unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention" - to German as: "The Idle Mind: The definition of boredom in terms of attention," in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science," which appeared in September, have Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person was reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television in the next room, that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not heard this noise.
The people who heard the barely audible television, claimed to feel more bored than the other two groups - they had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you're trying to concentrate on a difficult or strenuous task, disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you, however, exerted a monotonous activity - "as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that fidgeting and doodling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, they can fight even by persons remain physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to fidget around, learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually get bored - my delayed flight, a booming speaker, a particularly tedious film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s, a "scale for boredom susceptibility".
On the scale we find statements like "Many things I have to do repetitive and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I did not have enough time for everything."
Using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more often dull than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially regarding the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a bunch of pretty haggard.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and while doing homework, whereas 23% reported being bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents reported that they feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know if the percentages are increased or decreased in terms of boredom.
However, he was sure that "the youth is seen as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have little impact on their everyday routine.
So back to my original question : Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it will cause people to take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to relieve it - the studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Vodanovich professor who studies the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain will tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what you should just do your best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But television can indeed provide for short-term happiness, but long term it evaporate again.
Who 's bored child enough so an iPad, so it may indeed distract from the boredom. It therefore has not learned to talk or to control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds : "self-control is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also gets into other areas more self-control.
I do not think we should celebrate boredom.
Also, we should not see them critically.
Instead, it should be our goal, we also feel comfortable away from the constant activity and irrigation technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we would be more boring., But boredom is excruciating, unrelenting desire to do something worthwhile," he says.
He believes that people are looking for in truth only for a way to unwind and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it 's hard to deal, even if the noise is silenced."
