El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years of age, who are often on the net on the go.
In four of the cases they associated the term with "something very private" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" if they used it on the social networks.

I sell me my time with friends.
"I would not share a photo that is not of me, or of someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is false, obscene photos of naked, to publish crime, violent or abusive or post comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.

Even if someone empfähle a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14 -year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know the 20 people that he has his friends list added.
"That scares me, not because we have something in common, such as music," he states.
After specifying the boys to him, no one has hinted or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone is hassling me or asked of me, I simply remove it from my account," he admits.
Jose reported to Ask, after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy experiences are not unknown that we know today as cyberbullying.

They threatened him and demanded money.

"But I know that this is cyberbullying" he explains.
key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher with a degree in education and learning, says that to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks, to be informed.
"The Internet was created as a means to search for information, with the appearance of these pages, the rules have changed but," she says.
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, and a Master title in Education at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" these concepts formed to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants, they are to teach, but even where we learn more," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we ask of them that they have a defined criterion about what common, may be published or told, and this. Reached an age where it is not mature enough"
"They should also be choosy when it is most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people, what is privacy, ask them questions that it brings to think.
"To tell you they are not doing is not working," he says.
Porras then mentions some options: There are things that you would not tell a stranger. Then why are you doing it on the internet?
Or: Would you like it if you posted a photo of you, like the one you released from a friend?
Do you know what the other post about you?
Have you previously asked the others for permission if you have tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question : Do all know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Someone is outside the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply for social networks," he explains.
monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, a primary school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that parents read the guidelines carefully the social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of reopening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you may share or disclose" he explains.
According to the Guardia children need the lesson "Do not talk to strangers" to be reminded.
