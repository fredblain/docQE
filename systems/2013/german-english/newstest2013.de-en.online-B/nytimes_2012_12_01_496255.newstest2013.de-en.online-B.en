In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19 -year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the Southeast Colorado court for an offense that will be legal in this state soon : The possession of a few chunks of marijuana and a pipe, which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border with Kansas on the road when they were stopped.
After the police had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - peccadilloes, which are each provided with a penalty of$ 100 - and was given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But he is also a?
In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends less on hundreds of smaller drug offenses with the law, as the location.
Hundreds of offenses that revolve around marijuana, here and in Washington State, which approved similar measures already dropped.
The police authorities pursue adults over 21 years no longer in possession of a small scale. This is legally allowed once the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the conservative Colorado counties have announced to continue existing marijuana offenses, citing people still in court.
At the same time agree to several cities, the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains from above to prevent new, state licensed marijuana businesses in the opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so fast to say that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state scratching their head helplessly.
They are waiting for a guide to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and earned a deadline of 1 December 2013 eyes.
In Washington, it is believed that in every case Colorado is ahead of most states, which relates to the regulation of marijuana. There, the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for personal consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Therefore, the state is good for orientation," said Brian E. Smith, Chairman of the supervisory authority for spirits in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve the purposes of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent for us to follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I- 502, take effect on 6 December is legalized in force and thus forms the endpoint of a gray area in which the state license system not yet exist, but the possession.
And unpleasant practical issues to be addressed at this time - such as the state's requirement of a "reasonable access" to be agreed to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"Nowhere, it will be difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a research group recently formed.
On 21 Chief Oates November sent his employees in Aurora an e- mail in which he declared that the prosecutor would pursue minor marijuana offenses in persons over 21 years no longer, and that the police "immediately" no criminal charges will strive for this offense.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce municipal regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers would continue to occur.
In Weld County in northern Colorado District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view.
After the vote, he said that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana must stand trial, though many were prosecuted for other offenses.
"Our agency has a duty to pursue violations, which are criminal offenses concerned at the material time," Buck had said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the county, shows adults for possession of small quantities is not longer.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership process.
"I do not think that I am wasting my time to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, from the beginning it was clear that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted among local officials a profound dichotomy in terms of the large green experiment days.
In district prosecutors if it were a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents standing for marijuana offenses in court accused and acts as spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws site.
"They have such a large part of their life spent for this to prosecute persons that they still can not accept the legalization," he believes.
The first states that treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington traded as a national model cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for a legal age of sale, at the same time they are waiting nervously to instructions of the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offense.
Advocate the legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give way.
Despite a number of sensational arrests of consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government announced the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states allow for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that detectives are indeed likely to occur no doors to confiscate small amounts of the drug, however, it will probably balk, under the new legislation, legal, state-regulated marijuana to tolerate businesses.
Several cities in Colorado did not even wait that the federal act.
Even before the election day some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, although this could only open in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a town in the west, a six-month ban, which is probably adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then at the federal level are facing a big problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We act on this, for what the community has chosen and not feel for what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
