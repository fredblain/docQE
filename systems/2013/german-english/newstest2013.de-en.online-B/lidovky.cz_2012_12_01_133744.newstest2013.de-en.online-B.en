The film Argo : If it is the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release they demanded the surrender of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which had maintained for decades the patronage of his regime.
For the U.S. government, there was no positive way out of this situation - they could not afford to throw overboard the Shah, because it would have damaged the trust of its allies in other countries massively.
At the same time she was not in a position in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, to secure the release of hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent violent fiasco when the hostage rescue attempt only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were released after 444 days of negotiations with the Algerian government had been taught.
The fate of the hostages called home produced a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode in history that the United States gave a small partial victory.
Immediately prior to the occupation of the Embassy of six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, taking them helped an extravagant story to conceal their true identity - she traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film rod, allegedly in the country locations for a science fiction film attended.
Combining the Genres
From the experts, developed for "exfiltration" Tony Mendez plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywood.
So that the camouflage was credible, published articles on this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of this operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a particular combination of film genres.
On the one hand it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time, a so-called "Caper Movie", ie the story of a successful piece of hussars, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in mood levels from the movie - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and slightly exaggerated come along.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, the office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded with this film a remarkable restart his career.
From a ridiculed actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is now no longer the goal ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film based on the thriller Gone Baby Gone (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City without Mercy (2010).
At the same time it's Affleck's first movie is not playing in his native Boston, the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was like the features that stood out the previous movies of this director from the standard Hollywood.
However, Affleck proves this sense also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the movie playing in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that actually took place - the input sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its simplicity, and yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when somewhere once moves the story.
A similar effect is achieved Affleck with his team at fictional scenes (the wrong film crew at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with it, that the story really does not offer many exciting scenes in cinematic sense.
But with the little he has worked quite successfully, and he sometimes nachhilft reality something - which then acts not always so stylish (the scenes of the impending crisis is averted at the airport in Tehran by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem a bit contrived).
The weakness of Argo is its excessive fragmentation, which is due to the necessity to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood staff although very charming, but their characters have earned more space, and therefore they are not in the movie by far alone.
Affleck film loses some traction. It is a film that you follow with some interest, while the design and a thriller from the 70th Years can goutieren reminiscent retro style.
However enthusiasm he wakes difficult.
As a reminder of a still alive in some way as a piece of history and evidence of how the ideas are still covered by the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence, but it is sufficient.
