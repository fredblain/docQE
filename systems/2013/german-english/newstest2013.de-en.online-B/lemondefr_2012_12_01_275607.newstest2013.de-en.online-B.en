He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraising for the liberal former Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him

The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this before the Commission : in ten years he received from contractors gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in the amount of$ 736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he artificially inflated.
Other officials of the Road Office have admitted that they could be lubricated by using false invoices ballooned the additional services artificially by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget that filled his coffers with dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay has resigned in early November, which Montreal plunged into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first members of Montreal, which sounded the alarm.
As Mayor of the Borough of Rivière -des- Prairies, to the east of the island, she leaned from 2010 against the sale of community land to that acquired for$ 5,000,000 and was sold for 1.6 million to property developers in the booming real estate market.

How to make clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, in turn, noted that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but makes mainly thinking about the role of the "elected officials who are about tactics in the picture" when they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting with a 70% share of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quips : "I was told that this was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to political parties to$ 100, which according to him would not change the situation ". Solange campaign spending are not strictly limited, Black money in politics will be in circulation"
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can not fall lower, as we go to things with courage to the bottom, we can visit the house on a more solid base with more controls and laws again build on."
