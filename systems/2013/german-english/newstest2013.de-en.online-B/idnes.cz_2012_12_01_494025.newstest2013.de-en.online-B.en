Poland and space.
Last week Poland was recorded on a Council of Ministers meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency as a member of this twentieth Space Agency. Poland is now the second member country of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic, the ESA member was on November 12, 2008).
Poland began in 1994 in close cooperation with ESA and participated in the following years in several ESA projects.
The way Poland into space began much earlier, however.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts busy with the space where they are not always met with understanding on it.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought "entrance to the Cosmonautics" introduced in his pioneering work.
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld still reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the Cosmonautics" donated by Robert Esnault - Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix REP - Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a leading proponent of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis internationally recognized contribution to the development of space was include thereby acknowledged that one of the craters was named on the far side of the moon for him.
A railway bogie was built in 1925 in Poland, for a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the design and the details of this project unfortunately remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile should be used to start or to brake the trolley.
The information is sourced from contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket -powered projectiles.
The research, the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the traditional documents, it is evident that the research had advanced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then of course interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 appeared in the trade press of the coming of Ing Rohozinski draft photoelectric hunting rocket on, and the following year appeared in the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" the author Leliwa - Krzywoblocky.
Both projects were concerned with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of the missile technology from passers Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo - Naukowy) were coordinated.
The Committee was set up in 1937, after two years of activity, however, his work was ended by the outbreak of war.
More articles on space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problemy, are dedicated to the four articles of the extensive space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to create a space company.
At the time, there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was expected that the exploration of space would have a future.
Even in its early days in 1956, the Polish aerospace company sought a PTA membership of the International Federation for Aerospace, founded in 1951, and was the PTA actually decent in the fall 1956 members.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz was Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space.
He held until his death in 1959 this office.
Since 1956 the PTA involved instrumental in developing the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM -1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 Oktober, 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 inches long and weighed not quite 5kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM -1A, built, and in 1959 began in the desert Błędów - flight tests with the two-stage rocket RM -2.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another development stage should already be able to make real scientific work - the RM -34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and come for the observation of high altitude winds are used.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
Successor of the first missiles RM was developed in the years 1962-1965 Meteor -1 rocket.
The rocket was designed as a two -stage rocket, their total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Of these three types were developed rocket (Meteor -1A, -1B and 1C) that differ from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor -1A rocket had a transport capacity of 0.4 liters, meteor -1B about 0.34 liters and 0.62 liters over 1C Meteor.
The maximum altitude was 37 km for all three types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor -2 rocket was developed in the aviation institute, began its first flight test in October 1970.
Meteor -2 had a launch mass of 380 kg, and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor Meteor -3 and 2H were built.
Also worth mentioning is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, later followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee on the two years.
Poland participated in the Intercosmos program also in space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs was cosmonaut Vladimir Remek second Inter.
