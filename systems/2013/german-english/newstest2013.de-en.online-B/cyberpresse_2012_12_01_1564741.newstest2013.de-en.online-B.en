Prostate cancer screening : the test should be done or not?
The PSA test, in fact sometimes erroneous results, but also with false negative or false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater reluctance of an indecisive men for performing screening tests.
The test should be done or not?
We have sought the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous confounding factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to provide clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection is.
This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the probability of the formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher when no screening was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years if you have a direct relative who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
In men, African-American ethnicity also have a higher risk.
The important thing is to make the right decision when a cancer is detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and indolent others.
The patient must be the degree of risk of his cancer be truly understood by the possible options it identified where prostate cancers may remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long run, and it is in these cases active rather for monitoring the disease decides.
Today is no treatment for many men with cancer has been recognized, instead, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
You propose to actively monitor and provides them with disease progression on treatment.
Is determined with increasing accuracy the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not.
That's why I still recommend running the test.
Most important, however, to speak with his physician to determine whether he should be executed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology Movember has developed a tool, with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no panacea for the prevention of cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and get enough exercise.
"If there was no smoking, this value would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers remains.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancers.
There is also a risk factor for a number of other cancers.
It severely damaged the health of the people.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data : 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette decreases the risk of dying from cancer by half.
weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer Grimm," he adds.
the diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risk of developing cancer of the rectum or a Grimm.
Meats should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
vitamin
In recent years, several scientists have the association between vitamin supplements and cancer investigated.
But their studies are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While a study has found that reducing the risk of prostate cancer, showed another rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed how important it is to talk to his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
