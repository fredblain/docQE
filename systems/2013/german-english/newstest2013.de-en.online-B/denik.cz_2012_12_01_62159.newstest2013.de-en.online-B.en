Šimon Ornest : At our concerts we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month, end of the world to take place?
This is one of those catastrophe reports, which we like to jump people like this.
With our band, The Tap Tap we make it more funny and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop the doomsday or prevent.
In December you also implement a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraising event, we are already planning two years.
For this purpose we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of the 21 December is forecasted at 11:10 clock in the morning.
The day before, that is on 20 December, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held simultaneously from 21:00 clock.
The end of the concerts will be at about the time of the ending on the Pacific island of Kiribati, located in a time zone 12 hours ahead to Mayan calendar.
By whom this idea come from?
Probably originally from me, then we have the idea embodied in common with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We want to not only collect enough positive energy to prevent the apocalypse, but we also want together with the public to think about what state we even give our children the world over.
At the end of the Mayan calendar we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T- shirts, bags and key rings end of the world, with their purchase via www.e- tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other artists also the so-called hymn to the apocalypse titled "Doomsday fails," added.
Even today, the hymn is very popular on YouTube. If they sound on benefit concerts?
Of course, namely the very end, assuming that everything works and the apocalypse does not happen...
The anthem will be sung by all performers simultaneously on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live together in a direct circuit by Czech Television.
The text of the anthem is by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene that goes with it, that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We strive to integrate these people into our intensive projects.
It has been shown that most are interested in working with us, and have fun doing it.
What purpose will the proceeds of the concert to the end of the world benefit?
For the establishment of accessible education center Studeo where we have been working together for six years with the club Tap in Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Institute Jedlička are regularly supervised by assistants who help them in various recreational activities.
Since the students do not even have the means to visit the editors, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is a private building arise in which we move with this project.
At every concert several groups and performers occur.
What criteria did you choose this?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiri Suchy occur.
Everything else you learn www.kpks.cz. on the website
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May, we meet for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are then ever in the U.S. - this would also like to connect with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, the Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, ie wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. We also of course have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, CSA and British Airways were always prepared very well for us that I have sometimes wondered partially.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your traveling abroad, you have to compare how it looks in different countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
As you have seen these things before?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnesses to the fact that in the East, all is in its infancy.
Compared to Moscow, Prague is absolutely not wheelchair accessible. There is still uncommon when someone is traveling alone in the city center in a wheelchair.
It is there not even a matter of course that you vorlässt a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there also arise clubs who try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things in which we hang behind...
This, however, is also to be noted that an improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it is very common that people also move independently with severe disabilities in the public domain, go to the museum can use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common, that there a large group of disabled people actively involved in social action, whereby we are with the band The Tap Tap a little ahead of the West!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when coming from our ranks major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change.
So far these are only isolated cases of very strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years : What was in 1998 motivated to start a band?
At that time, I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were keen to engage in some intensive.
And as a musician myself, and inter alia Saxophone playing, I founded together with a colleague Music AG.
Well, with time, much like our moderator, Láďa Angelovič uses to say something out of control (laughs).
But the band was known only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that we helped to working with famous singers in addition, we have also begun to actively recruit for us.
We realized that if one does something and this is not visible to the outside world, their own performance in a sense does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also good proofreaders, quality appliances and etc. afford.
Was it your goal to make it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt the potential that you can do things differently.
In show business today often copied one another.
This is logical in its own way, as everything carefully considered new and will be accepted only after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap one of them.
The first impression the audience has usually is, of course, compassion, which is only natural...
But this sympathy is absolutely unnecessary, because people are not lonely and abandoned creatures with disabilities that we would regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop as long as they have the necessary funds.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed in something, this is not only for itself a step forward, but for the whole society.
Was it for this success also helps that you are a strict boss, as one hears from many people?
If you want to do something good, you should not compromise on many things and must demand a certain amount of discipline.
I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic notions, and when they find that they have twice a week sample must complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the enthusiasm of many expire soon.
So but it works everywhere, in every band who work seriously and want to achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were from the beginning, that is since 1998?
Only one : Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. This can not be prevented.
Who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome.
