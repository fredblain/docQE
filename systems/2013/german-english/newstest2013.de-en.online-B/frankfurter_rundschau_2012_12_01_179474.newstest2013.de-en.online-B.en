Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice should possibly be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, as is apparent from three published Thursday in the journal "Science" studies.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is a sheet of ice in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that are stamped on the Mercury.
No one brings the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in relation, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have fallen into other areas of the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the Earthlings are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix about to explore the depths of space.
From time to time they send images back to Earth : Small peepholes into the final frontier.
The image comes from a camera that German researchers have developed at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, orbiting the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is after the new term defined by the International Astronomical Union from 2006, no "planet".
This image of cut- infrared image from the Spitzer Space Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars can be seen as blue dots, are more difficult to identify the pink "newborn" in the Zodiac Room.
This star- forming region - known by scientists unromantic W5 - has the Spitzer discovered in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has received the NASA Spitzer Telescope.
The donut - shaped ring is made of material that threw out the star in the process of dying.

The Pleiades star cluster, also known as "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope but the colors are better advantage.
Looks like a red Age of the Helix Nebula in this infrared photo towards the viewer.
It is located 700 light- years away in the constellation Aquarius.
His resemblance to a terrestrial continent brought this fog the title of North America.
A combination of regular and infrared photo makes for a spectacular color.
This baby star could be taken in its full beauty only by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings : As these are developed, is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe they are the remains of a Saturn moon who disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Space Telescope : The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colors are recordings of spiral galaxies to true works of art.
The list published by the European Southern Observatory image shows the several thousand light -years away Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word Trifid trifidus (three-piece, three split), as dark dust lanes three share the glowing heart of the birthplace - stars.
In the constellation Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carom : 400 million light-years away from Earth rush the cores of two merging galaxies to collide with each other and are inevitable.
This star- birth recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope on the spiral galaxy M83.
Who are not technical abbreviations, they may call her by her nickname Southern Pinwheel.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a portion of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The 1400 light- years distant nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times less than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light- years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, took on the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy UGC scientists call 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new youngster.
These stars - Cloud, connected with the Rosette Nebula, constantly bringing new baby star - 5000 light years from Earth.
In this light bright galaxy with a small black hole still exists no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he is only created shortly after the Big Bang, as was mostly to find hydrogen in the universe.
Our insights into space : The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lippershey - even before Galileo Galilei began observing the star a year later.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescopes were getting bigger - and the insights they provide, getting deeper.
30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope was the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, pictured here, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, steht das Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into the same space over two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the optimized design : The telescope is lashed in his elevation angle - and therefore limited in its mobility.
Even the hobby - Eberly Telescope in Texas is fixed in elevation.
Its special feature : the high light-gathering power.
This is sufficient if - despite comparatively low diameter mirror - the mirror of the world's largest telescopes zoom.
With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers hear from the All for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing computing power available.

Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean Observatory ESO European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its main mirror will include a whopping 42 feet - and are made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements together.
With pictures but is expected no earlier than 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which still looks with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky next to them.
Also on Mauna Kea to be built, a huge new telescope - with a mirror - average of thirty meters.
Here it can be admired on an illustration.
However, the main impressions from space provides the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler searches for extrasolar planets - especially for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 it was announced by NASA that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission begins.
The picture shows the final launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 - shot rocket into space.
The primary mirror of the infrared space telescope having a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope : it should look from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang to light.
Scientists assume that also exists at the south pole of Mercury Ice.
But there are actually no reliable data because the Messenger orbiting far closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades hinted at the fact that there is ice on Mercury.
By the Messenger probe, launched in 2004 - the first in orbit around Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
