Cause of death due to AIDS today is a belated recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the investigation : HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says of the moment when he got the diagnosis, "tried to mitigate" for no apparent success of the physician.
He hid it from his family.
He decided alone to care for his illness and began to inform themselves about, and this with such use that he just his 43rd Birthday celebrated.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was the beginning of the 90s hard to imagine, as there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
Then avoided even the director of a clinic in the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
Damals war Tod für synonym AIDS.
Today it is possible to survive with this syndrome quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic, who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already caused damage and their immune system has been exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, that after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of patients receiving the treatment time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the Head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was based, in April of this year, by a reputable scientific publication.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded since 2008 that although AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life on the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of the depended on treatment, and those that would have greater chances that are not addicted to drugs : up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years with a CD4 count of 500.
Simply put, the above observations imply that anyone who receives the diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, in this sense, "can easily be 75 years of age, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to assess this progress really need to be reminded that the life expectancy of the average Mexican is 76 years today.
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS, from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (Annual Report of the UNAIDS) decreases), it is nevertheless true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent recorded in the national database of patients have died.
In Jalisco alone died in 2011 255 people, and until the month of May this year, there have been 187 deaths, but be assured that there is since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral drugs.
- Why people are still dying of it?
- In my opinion the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come into a very advanced state, because they do not know their infection status, ie. In very late stages of disease
He makes a striking statement. "Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have a concomitant infection in order to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are required, which is why all persons for whom this is necessary massively detection tests are offered have to."
This proposal, agree the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (National Committee for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and the patient as Fabrizio to that made his test to perform at a private lab, and this made the only reason that it had made a friend of his, who was already in the AIDS stage despite his young age and even had Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they are going to die, and would not hear anything.
"If I must die, rather then burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve back, I eat well, do sports and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work in an entrepreneurial lot, had an active, yet responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio enumerates who agreed to share their intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony that, now in the context of the global AIDS Day are afraid.
You should take the test if they are at risk. The sooner they know whether they are HIV -positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly as all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between the health plans and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has assumed the responsibility of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
To specific locations on the "condom distribution was actually increased; previously they were sold individually, now they give us packages with hundred of what is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom", he said.
To persons at risk for new infections among young people.
"What do you need that?" is a common question mockery of social workers, guidance personnel in schools, employees in pharmacies and the health care system, the young people do not want to expose themselves, assured the correspondent.
He suggested to orient these new inefficient distribution, the condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in the output devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequented by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
It should not be paid for them the beer and motel, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked whether his administration would be distributed condoms.
"Sexuality does not look so, it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already exercise a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is seen nationally on 4 Location of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13 Place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection via sexual intercourse, blood and 6% higher than the 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case, who do not know.
