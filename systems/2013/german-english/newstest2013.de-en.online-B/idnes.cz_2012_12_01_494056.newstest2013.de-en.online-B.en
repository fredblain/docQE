The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on public works.
This decision called in public produced a lively discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective times out.
The liberal -oriented economies in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual national economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labor (wages), there is price tensions.
This term is defined as a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to pass through import cheaper goods in economic competition by "undercutting" the competition so as to tear a larger market share and to increase its profit.
On a large scale this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy there cheap, or give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labor costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, necessarily increase government spending.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the men entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus to replace the damage they have overall social economic and social damage.
This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics at this point are unnecessary.
The reckless practice of private capital creates in the individual economies in which the governments are forced to enter into competition with each other to reduce the social level of the population own artificially and thus attract foreign capital into the country a situation.
In other words, the governments provide their own population without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This manifests itself particularly in changes in applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital especially in the wage sector.
This is done firstly by economic pressures in long-term unemployment, the other by the erosion of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty and increasing inequalities between rich and poor.
In Germany it has been around for several years public food distribution points for the poor, who are no longer able to sustain themselves by their own labor.
The number of those affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there will frequently be cases where workers receive a wage so low that the state needs to increase their income up to the poverty line.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of assistants employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures virtually all EU Southern will undoubtedly come down to the same condition in which people are forced under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance on margins of society to starve and to hope that sometime private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here suggests itself naturally to the question, where did this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty migrates from one country to another, or all of the capital remains the same, because working in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt and in Africa in general employees for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseum that the state must not involved with capital to its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists on his narrow-minded view that the state should not intervene in directing the economy.
Then you have to ask yourself whether or not private capital influences the policy and thus the entire state in their own selfish purposes, or even deflected.
Here is the definitive answer : Yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent, omnipresent in all states lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual Before graduation, a legislation in which everything is practically reprehensible, but not criminal.
In Germany the situation is such that a State Department commissioned a lack of finances private, closely intertwined with the industry right company with the elaboration of draft laws.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power is then no longer derived from the people as it spread the western constitutions, but of strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies currently fall quickly into a situation as ' Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey : " The state has long been understood in the decay, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribery, by unlawful or fraudulent acquisition of benefits with stone and sword.
Corruption is rampant unrestrained, and the people did not go with already bought votes for election "..." people with character competed for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months Consul had no "..." You began really to talk about, that is the only medicine in this difficult situation is an autocracy, and that a strong man should be elected "... Appian was thinking while at Pompey, but the strong man eventually was then Caesar, the durable democracy through the autocracy replaced.
It turns out that the present society is based, as in ancient times on the preference of the ruthless own advantage, without regard to societal interests.
Private capital is not recognizable from its nature, be able to benefit for the whole society and enforce.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elite who do not strive for deeper reforms in the least.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20 Search century.
Seen from the present condition, the downfall of this regime in favor of liberal democracies can be regarded as certain interval at which the next round already emerging.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites the potential future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnessing today, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know from the past and recent history, in complete ignorance of standing.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work here is not a solution, at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase capital participation of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the Company in favor of the state.
