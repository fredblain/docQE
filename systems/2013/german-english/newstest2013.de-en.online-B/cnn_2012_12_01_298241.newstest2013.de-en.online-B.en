The corporal of the U.S. Army is alleged to have stolen thousands of confidential documents
The prosecution has tried on Friday to determine that the Army Corporal Bradley Manning - accused of the biggest revelation of confidential information of U.S. history - several occasions failed to complain about the alleged ill-treatment he had suffered in military detention.
In cross-examination Manning during a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland said Maj. Ashden Fein, that documents relating to weekly visits, the prison officials had made during Manning's nine -month prison term in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request of the defense to dismiss the indictment - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard prison time - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was released by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never been confirmed as the source of the information Manning.
At the hearing on Friday went fine with Manning through the forms that were filled out by their officials meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison where he had been eating from July 2010 to April 2011 under intensified conditions of detention.
The officers found Manning and wrote his answers to questions.
As fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had the overall treatment judged by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as "very professional".
The forms so fine, contained no complaints about ill-treatment, although the officials were asked about the Manning 's treatment.
Manning replied that he had brought his concerns verbally expressed and the officials had discussed this with him and given to deal with this. You were not logged.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns)" No Problems "on, and that does not necessarily mean that I did not say anything," said Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning asked why he did not complain about his treatment when he arrived in January 2011 with a committee to investigate the few months before he referred to a form suicidal thoughts.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting have been to let demote his observation status to the "prevention of injury".
The military said out there have this restrictive status to him - which is one step below the suicidal - assigned to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince team members that I was fine, and the observation status of injury prevention get rid of (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life, in my view," Manning said.
Manning said Thursday in his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before he was transferred in July 2010 in the prison of the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia.
He said in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had once fainted because of the heat.
Not allowed to know what was happening with him or in the outside world, was distressing.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
They had allowed him only a mattress, a blanket, flip- flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he had tried to keep moving, because the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with the light that penetrated into his cell from the outside.
If he had turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, you have woken him so he turns back again.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally raised objections to the treatment of Manning.
In April 2011, Manning was moved to the Kansas military prison in Fort Leavenworth.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned about an allegation that he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico and have to be naked in front of guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning testified that he had during this count never had the opportunity to envelop with his blanket.
In the survey on Friday Manning stated that he had closed his command of a guard that he should leave the blanket with which he would be able to cover fall. He admitted, however, that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced into the previous night to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show an officer that he does not constitute a danger to themselves.
Manning had told the officers that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip- flops to hurt yourself, this is not done.
That night, as Manning testified were his pants, flip- flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will consider his prison experiences and at least drastically reduce its Haftma√ü, he should be sentenced at his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offenses, while other charges that are considered too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. By the prosecution to justify the detention conditions is expected.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all under the highest security prisoners held in custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include abetting the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If it is found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
