Prove the MVRDV architects that the true adventures are not just in your head - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built mountain books - 2 photos
"I find that funny building, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to look at," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a nearby large company, said: "Yes, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we even need a library today.
All have Internet, iPad, and E-Books.
No man still goes voluntarily into one of those old-style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little sightseeing needy bedroom community on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.
The 80,000 - resident community has the lowest rate of formation of the whole of the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid situation, it was decided some years ago to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro notes as pretty daub reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education campaign was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become Lord of Statistics : A library needed here!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of daring producer of bar charts and witty, and often cynical buildings, took the matter with his usual composure and appeared to competition Hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury is still puzzled looked around and shrugged, stacked the cheeky Maas its exquisite souvenirs of the size of a pyramid and ended his actionistically underpinned speech with the words, "Love borough"
This is it, my suggestion for the mountain of books from Spijkenisse, the so-called Bökenberg!
Nine years later, the 30- million-euro mountain is filled up.
He is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments belong.
In early November the mountain of books with the second award was "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award nomination in 2012.
Thus the faceless town retort which had not so far as to offer a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind the white facades one might be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a rich piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to book
The first impression : Books Eldorado under bell jar.
While there is an elevator that leads through the mountain range in the middle, but the real space and reading pleasures are largely self fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The fully glazed interior is bright and clear, the fired brick floor and the elegant street lanterns speak the language of an unmistakably urban public space.
The urban setting is perfect.
It already is looking park bench, dog and football gambling guys and gals.
And all books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves are along the facade, and in the center is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have provided the classical configuration space to the head and slipped the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is cleverly used books : In the center are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center, and engineering office.
A special delight are the black bookcases, wall covering, the times, times parapet times are banisters.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even inveterate architects and civil engineers shake unknown whether the building material the head.
"We wanted this to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the city council Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so we have come in a friesländischen farm one day to an appropriate waste products from agriculture.
For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields on a millimeter -thin synthetic fleece pad as root.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin fabric keeps one or two seasons, after which it is ready for the rubbish.
For the library, the web was - for the first time in these quantities - Pressed to four inches thick plates.
Under heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) discolored to a dark, homogeneous, stress-resistant material which is a smell mingled with a bit of new cars and bissl by sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of almost 500 meters long wanderings you will be rewarded not only in the literary café with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literature Mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, yes, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass dome, the sun shines even on sunny days only briefly inside.
The wide wooden laminated beams that are perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as shade and catch a large part of the sunlight.
The climate is very pleasant.
The rest is fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics of the IT industry, already took the road to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was there.
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde that the Bökenberg even as Spijkenisses "long overdue soul" means.
The reason : the opening few weeks ago, everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal portfolio.
Thus, for the time being to even the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - filled - currently 70,000.
The concept worked.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation to every resident now has a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that the book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
MVRDV is so successful that pinnacle, called Identity Foundation in technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
So young and uneducated they may be.
Finally this is a starting point for identity.
