Beginning of the course, which studied the "end of the world"
Each week, students investigate topics such as the apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook : the end of the "long count down" of the Mayan calendar on 21 December, from which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
Charmé but had no idea what was waiting for him in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, as some have called the "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I did not realize that this will be the apocalyptic semester that there ever was," said Charmé this week the students at the University of Rutgers - Camden (New Jersey).
If anyone analyzed what happened today in the world, as if we had thirty days from that, this would be a really good season.
And he remembered that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor who, courses about the "end of the world" offers this semester, which really should be the last in history.
Temple of assessors Professor Barry Vacker is the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students investigate topics such as the apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread out over time," he said, and the way how hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a specific human behavior.
If nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out, for example.
This month analyzed the student films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared in comparison with real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probable and credible is impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and Amara Solari his colleague, an assistant examiners professor of art history and anthropology have formed a team to offer "The End of the World" a course with the simple name.
"We do not 2012, so that we always have the option to hold the new course, for the case that the world does not go down," Restall said.
Despite the "impending doom", students must study, create projects, and participate in audits.
Penn State in the final examination is conducted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no choice but "to continue working until the night when the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more places" Restall said about his course for students with a high average, which was filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the semester begins, we received emails from students who asked if there are free places.
The students in turn assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23 - year-old student at Rutgers - Camden on Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects or religious mentality is really just a question of comfort or lack thereof.
The 25- year-old student Will Wekesa declared psychology and nursing, having seen all apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a class, this is where taught," he stated.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less still a professor - explained, the last date of the 21 December to believe.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayans, and some way we discredit them," said Julie Żegleń, student last year in Temple, 21 years old from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world ahead, it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries, as did the people react to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places, people do not think so," he says.
This is mainly used in the English-speaking world the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, responds quickly to the question whether he would know there a course on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines is not involved at the end of the world," he wrote as a hint of an exception to a higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that was spoken over the years many days of the last judgment, and said that if 21 December nothing happened, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized about that 21 December, the start of a seven-year period is, after the end of the world would come.
Students and professors by that date easily.
Several said that they would like to go to parties about the "end of the world".
"Maybe I 'll call a few friends so we can laugh together," Ford said Samira, a 20- year-old student for communications.
