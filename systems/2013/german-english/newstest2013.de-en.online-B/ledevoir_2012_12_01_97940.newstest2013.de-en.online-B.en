Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With her committee for "death with dignity" Quebec has discussed the sensitive issue of end of life recently.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
Of prostate cancer, the aufzehrte him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've done seven years," he said half-heartedly, in his bed at home for palliative care Victor- Gadbois lying in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it 's always a shock, it is not to be prepared," he says.
The disease makes their work : an immense weakness prevents him alone to go to the bathroom and even to eat itself.
On the table in front of a delicious lunch sitting, he agrees resigned to seek help when eating.
Boldly, he succeeds to even smile and talk to the stranger who work around him, give him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that you heal my diarrhea because it is humiliating," he announced.
A few hours later, the team has found a remedy for this evil.
"Throughout our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, Psychologist Home Victor- Gadbois.
Return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"That depends on the ability of the person" to accept a step back, he notes.
Because several people who work in palliative care to view large events take place in the midst of this regression.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor- Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are not overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so -called "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years is the worst fear, "consciously and by suffocation" to die.
But by the disease, I learned my children really know.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no desires in life," she says, before she accepted that touches her a mask that helps her breathing.
Awaits them in the next few days still a last visit her son, who comes from Italy.
Victor- Gadbois in the home provides you with a group of volunteers and personal care assistance at the time of food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options more.
To make dying more comfortable.
In Quebec, comes to 11,700 inhabitants a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little when you consider that one day we will all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying as desired an oral care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer Mr. X, who died during the night.
Today morning drink the beer at the feet of the deceased, his son.
"We help families and patients alike," says Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
Victor- Gadbois in the home is not a day like any other.
Next to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillow, while stumbling in his honor, died a young man of 36 years, that of his parents, his wife and two young children surrounded, tragically, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds are always occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel divides troubled with.
53% of the home Victor- Gadbois admitted patients come out of their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, ie a care that will alleviate the suffering of patients, when the latter have reached the final stage of life, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, like the home of Victor- Gadbois and the Society for palliative home care in the greater Montreal more or less specialize exclusively to the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great deficiency in the Quebec health care ensures that more specialized in palliative care doctors passing a law for the regulation of euthanasia and assisted suicide look forward with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel of Quebec 's health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that all rights to high-quality palliative care have, before accepting a move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, without that one has taken action to relief.
I fear that the only reason why patients want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
While several oncologists treat patients despite their worst predictions doggedly until the last day.
The survival of Hélène Richard 've been minimal, as it has canceled an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I will stop the treatment, they answered me that they regret that I give up the fight, she said.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, to thank the nursing staff that it has not granted this request, after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care.
But it should be clear that palliative care in pain management is not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, Director of the Palliative Care Society of domestic Palliative Care of Greater Montreal 8% of patients do not respond to a pain treatment.
At the very end of life, the doctors so often refer to the terminal sedation, which comes down to it, either sporadically or permanently euthanize the patient up to the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief are increasingly have the ability to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, all say the same sentence : "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me" but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The realization of this report was made possible by a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.
