Petronella Wyatt : I was bullied from Oxford, because I 'm Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream was to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended university that I once held the largest knowledge temple in the world for a modern Greek symposium, that the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - promoted.
But within two weeks after I moved in Worscester college in the late eighties - where I had intended to study history - again I had packed my bags and so brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, they said I would have gone, because I had a problem with the fact that students in the neighboring room had sex.
The author AN Wilson said archly, I would leave the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
About not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
They had harassed me for only one reason - a reason that seemed so narrow-minded and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and I advocate the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar tracking suffers.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called on the same equal rights protection, the gay, the disabled and ethnic minorities will benefit.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They demand a place in the equality of their college committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
"Wonderland : Young, Bright and on the Right" worsened their situation by a recent documentary on political broadcast on BBC Two students, was the Tories represented as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
Was shown therein including graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative student association at the University of Oxford, who was driving in a Rolls -Royce and sported silver suit and silver studded cane.
Students at other universities say conservative, they are considered as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20 -year-old Luke Black, Vice- President of the Conservative Student Federation of the University of Nottingham, made the following statement in a Sunday newspaper : " There is a growing tendency to link universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon club to have met without us at all. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, and a student of history in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable". The 19 -year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the Conservative student association of Oxford says that she has a growing rejection of students observed in the moderate right JCR members.
"This represents a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the welfare of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford I was in such a minority.
An incredibly shy 18 -year-old I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its peak.
Last year, the university had voted for Margaret Thatcher - a former student - to give no honorary title because of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have startled even Stalinists.
In the first days of freshman week, with the new students get to know themselves and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerate the mockery of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure in mind.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatization and the rejection of sanctions against the government of South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
On my first such event I should French texts from the 18th Century translation into English. In what should come then, I had not expected.
"Please translate the first paragraph," "Miss Wyatt," said the Philosopher Harry Pitt (now deceased).
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake, and rather spitefully.
"Refuse to Thatcher followers to learn French, or are they just stupid?" He asked me.
The other students snickered.
In my eyes welled in tears.
"I suggest that they take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," I growled at Pitt.
I returned with hanging head back to my room.
That night I sat alone at dinner in college, when someone tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory, is harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I later tried to adjust myself.
I insisted that I was not in all respects to Mrs Thatcher an opinion.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who had visited the ironically regarded as conservative Eton College, said to me : "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was a pervert and dirty.
"How Tories have sex?" Asked me one.
The beat each other, right?
I felt so, how homosexuals had felt before the liberal laws of the United States.
Would it ever be possible for me to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
If I can meet like-minded after nightfall?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me, stretched before my mind's eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who was to clearly identify themselves as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which had its seat in my college.
He was not only hated for being a conservative, but because he had Thatcher advise in matters of foreign policy and speeches written for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, it was provincial and narrow-minded, and rejected it for its Marxist- deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I started to commute between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
Something they would never do that, not in my city of dreaming spiers.
Even my Communist friends always put proper manners of the day.
His moist eyes clouded over.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you just teasing you.
It would break my heart when you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London my emotional resistance was weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had yielded to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial in the next week, in which a further history tutor was seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly grown tired of shame, I admitted that I had with my parents moved to a "brainwashing", and called them "old fool".
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who suggested the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes gave my bailiffs on.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Feel free to call me a whiny wimp.
But no 18 year old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and spite in an educational institution.
And is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that not only spawned 14 Tory Prime Minister, but hiding behind a still undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
