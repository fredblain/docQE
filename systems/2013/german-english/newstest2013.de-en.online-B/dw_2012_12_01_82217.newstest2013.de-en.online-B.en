Szabo, " German must play bigger role '
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine to the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US- European relations, Berlin poised so on a narrow diplomatic level.
German wave : Earlier in the week had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations, Germany.
But then Berlin contained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo : Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza, no.
Germany now has to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel, however.
But at the same time I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstained when it came to establish a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Germany Is it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, that's right.
The reason is that it is precisely his foreign policy surrounded and moving away from a policy that was as it were managed by the United States towards a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are so contradictory between the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but because they are not accustomed.
I think she even comes close to their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as France and the UK have.
What does a "normal" foreign policy as concrete from the German perspective?
It shows a willingness to relate to national interests and positions that are independent of those of the U.S. or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, ie exports and its relations with particular regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some degree different from that of the other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have had an impact on the attitude of the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public, but also the elites in Arab countries over the head.
Which plays a role in any case.
But I would want to attach to not put too much weight, that is not completely one-sided relationship.
But it plays an important role in German considerations in any case.
Germany has its relations with the United States damaged by abstained from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe and even in the U.S. there is great sympathy for the German position.
So I do not think this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany is so even play some respect.
But because it signaled that it be taken seriously as an international player and his interests must be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., however, have expressed clear support for a veto.
There are disagreements between the United States and many European nations?
Because of U.S. domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has secretly probably pretty much understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can not represent that position publicly of course.
I believe that the actual differences are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so absolutely thrilled by Netanyahu's policies.
Finding it difficult to Germany, his close relations with Israel and the U.S. on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side to agree?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a bit easier for the Germans, if there was a consistent and coherent European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they can not be part of a broader line and must instead promote things from their own position.
They do precisely with the euro.
I think in the future Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
This is of course not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think that the Germans realized that they need to play a more independent role.
Germany looks to himself in the role as a major international player - Germany wants ever to play a major role?
Or falls Germany the lead still struggling?
Germany is still not used to it, that's still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it drops the country still struggling to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis because every time when Germany takes on a greater role, a variety of anti - German feelings freely.
That makes it not just the Germans.
This is actually the old problem : you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Seen in Germany in a much more difficult position than the U.S..
It must be receptive to different opinions and neighbors, and that's not easy.
Now, the influence of the U.S. in European politics continuously, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who remains otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like them, it's uncomfortable and it makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
