Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his office, Will Grant analyzed by the BBC which he challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better times, this is always a congested city, but a ring of steel was erected on Monday, several blocks off the major transport routes into the capital and provides for chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, it was not to interfere with commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President binding and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove good economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has claimed in the past six years already 60,000 lives.
"My government is committed to strong to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office of the U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this goal.
Before he went on par with the U.S. President, Pena Nieto has worked as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated large part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo is remembered for example like him.
Residents of the resort ascribe the development of tourism and infrastructure development.
To reach the city, you can ride on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which constitute a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that were once here.
Plaques with his name hanging outside a modern sports center and a spectacular interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect it to real and lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In particular, as for the safety and economy, we look forward to an interesting and real change that our country needs so badly.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years, great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos.
The allegations of the opposition, the new president lacked substance, he refuses.
He was a very direct man, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the State shall not many people that view their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is tucked under highway overpasses and is a suburb of Mexico City itself in many ways dar.
And the problems in the community are critical of urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military has turned to combat the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years on a patch of wasteland near a large landfill.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto than 1,000 women have been murdered in the State of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses the town of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killing of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nieto are of the opinion that it is at least not adequately addressed the issue of femicide during his tenure.
But in the worst case his government had closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights back tears as she shows me photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of events, according to Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived home with her, it seemed as if her body was washed," said Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and rigor mortis had already set.
While her mother tells her story, viewed from the wall is a picture of Mariana down on us. It is mounted beside a cross, bearing a single word : justice.
But exactly this, the family that they had denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me like I was a chatterbox, troublemaker, nag.
You want that you simply accept their judgment and keeps the mouth.
"But that is not possible when there were so many errors and omissions in the form," she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday binding receives the President, he does so also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families were grown in the last six years of violent crimes affected, and the new president has promised, particularly to take care of this problem during his tenure.
"I hope that as President he is as he was as governor," the PRI congressman says Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just before that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
