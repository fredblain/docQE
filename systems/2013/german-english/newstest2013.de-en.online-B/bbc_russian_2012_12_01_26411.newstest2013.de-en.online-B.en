A contribution to the black market, according to afford Baranez the weapons manufacturers.
"Nowadays, there are countless private armament factories that do not withstand the international competition and therefore the weapons in hand on the black market, about in Moscow, squander," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes craft production, as well as a mafia, organized the smuggling," said the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated what percentage each of the five channels on the supply of the black market in illicit weapons was about.
