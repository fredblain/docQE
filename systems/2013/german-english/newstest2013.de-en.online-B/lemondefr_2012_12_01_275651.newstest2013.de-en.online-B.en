"PSG is the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have assumed a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I 'm making progress on their side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements inspire me every day to to to improve my level of play.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I did not burst into enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint -Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
So you make the introduced Carlo Ancelotti's competitive advantage...
The new additions this summer are accustomed to stage matches very high levels.
You also know that each workout is crucial.
This means that a player like me, must provide the forehead and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is assisted by assistant coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Course.
Ancelotti instills a respect for all technicians.
In Ligue 1, there are no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January I made an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from an injury series.
The confidence he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1 Lyon has taken us to the place of the leader.
We lurk in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League we qualified for the knockout in this manner.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have a say against very good European teams our word.
First we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the second leg of the second round as a home game.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is the means to make this project for addressing these issues.
Would it be a big failure, not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year it is we really at heart, to skim this item.
In the last season we were close to it.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry off the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be with 79 points Master...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux compete for the title, I think we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it's normal that a lot is expected of us.
We accept that completely.
However, if we win at home against a Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can accuse us, that's a bit frustrating for sure.
One wonders what people expect more.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to create a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League we have demonstrated strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club does not make the last two seasons to qualify for the knockout stages, and also the huge spending has made !
With regard to the amounts invested were believed you to break with 15 points ahead!
This would mean that our opponents and the French title would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well in the last season were "boosted" by the new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be the smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won it in spite of all difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better that we speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and has many goals.
So he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue first
Wherever he played, he was made aware that he is a great player and an international star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, it also allows all others to make progress.
How have you experienced with the French Euro 2012 squad?
As a disappointment.
It was close to my heart, to take part in these championships.
Unfortunately, I was prevented my injury, knock out some play time.
I have seen things there, from which I emerged stronger.
Today I manage to achieve good matches for the national team.
This was my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson and now we have to set an example behavior on the day.
What is your opinion about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is strict, the players standing near and stimulates to victory.
Laurent Blanc as it was.
But I would like to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his objective by had qualified for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will be the "Bleus" lead to Brazil.
Represents the 16 October in Spain forced draw (1:1) represents a first game?
This game has given us confidence.
Each has worked for everyone else.
Prior to this meeting in Spain I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
