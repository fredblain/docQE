"Trademark" in China : When Puma and Armani are suddenly chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what's Armani polo?
Underlying this is an officially registered in China label that has nothing to do with the original company.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as not sue the actual namesake.
And even then it is not clear whether they get right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing LLP, specializing in intellectual property rights violations in the Far East.
Each week a new case lands on my desk.
Imitators already rich a few extra letters so that they can register their brands.
Thus, from simple Lu Gucci Gucci, Prada instead allowed to enter Prada Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, about the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010 was there to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name of art, who served also at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna, a Chinese company.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and intellectual property in the injured is well known.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores, almost exclusively sell the fakes.
Patt hole but cases are different: On behalf of his clients before he goes, however, that Chinese companies officially receive the Trademark Office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
Thus, women are meant to be rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any wrongdoing
"This is bad for business, you have to fight it," urged Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs in the sectors concerned in the millions, especially when expensive flagship products.
According to the market research firm CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubious entries on the register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the process can drag on, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because of the long duration of the offending name is the "market reality" has become.
If the plaintiff had bad luck, he would pay even money the plagiarist because he violated its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes here, the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese must therefore use today an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo that was reminiscent of BMW, the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China, Hong Kong and Singapore, which made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any wrongdoing.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing is true that there have been there in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and equipment shortages room.
Last year it was but "emergency situation returned to normalcy in the workflow" of the.
Thus, the backlog of pending opposition has dropped by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases has been closed, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, still waiting in the office 81,500 objections to completion.
To fight it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications were received during a CTMO on brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
That was a record, and means that China cited by the tenth time in a row the list of registrations around the world, the authority shall.
This applies also to the existence of valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011 were taken in fees 1.8 billion yuan.
Simplified, this means that any application in cutting costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To fight it costs much like the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group struggles against a Chinese counterfeiter.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts was excavated.
But the imitators still secured the Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
They even failed this because family name could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Office rejected the opposition because of the Munich back also.
In the next two instances Freudenberg was indeed right, but the process opponent fights to this day.
One must be extremely careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely time-consuming and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company's archives had to look through even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side in vain to a "high six-figure euro amount" for settlement.
"This shows us how much this is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even zur√ºckzuschwappen to Europe.
Namely, when there impersonators secure unprotected brands.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather login.
This business segment, the Group has long given up, but he managed to avoid the registry.
"You have to be extremely careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark laws, rather the foreigners should "everything is somehow worth protecting, sign in China" as Wentzler says.
Else can be much more expensive than the registry.
In fact : If Freudenberg is subject in the last act of his trademark drama, then one would have the other side pay royalties on their own behalf, stated Wentzler.
Or we are pushed in the relevant segment of the market.
