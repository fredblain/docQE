Birth of the universe
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board to make the search for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, this raises the important question of how we can reproduce ourselves in microgravity or on the spare planet?
There are not many choices in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planets we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Namely, Mars and Venus," the scientific staff of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin says.
However, while the conditions are relatively favorable for life on Mars, there on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees.
Only life were at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, ie in space possible.
The issue of procreation in space, the researchers treated initially with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit did not differ in the slightest from the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more specifically, from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 Quail eggs were sent into space to explore how the gravity affects the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chick needs to get a grip, it must be able to stand on his legs and begin to move," said head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid foundation, the chick was racing wildly.
Ten hours later the instincts of newborns blunted completely.
The chicks did not respond to light and sounds.
Four days later, she died just then.
"Twice we had chicks hatch and then put the whole thing one because it is simply impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychew keeps the failed experiment with the chicks in all tight.
The last breeding cage with animals 16 years ago flew into orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments continue.
However, only same-sex species are located on the Biosatelliten "Bion" position.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized sent into space.
In principle, there nothing special was found.
"That was just the Biosatelliten, but it was again only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the space rats were young.
The problem of propagation directly in the space you previously could not solve.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are taken out of their natural habitat, simply can not follow their reproductive instinct.
Unlike animals, humans could the principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thought and can produce a similar emotional background.
Due to ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
But women for 50 years already flying into space.
The biggest risk there was in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that has humanity, is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could answer the following question : Is it About the space flight?
If they can give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says veteran space Vakhtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 gave birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaya, which was twice in orbit, and even work outside the spacecraft was doing, a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have extremely few cosmonauts, where after long flights all went well and they had healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even with flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must find new ways of biotechnology, radiation protection and the search for the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydraulic laboratory in the preparation of cosmonauts center is an obligatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state, the cosmonauts routine win for working in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness
Even when adults perceive water as pleasant, it's a strange environment, but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander witness the fact that life on the land emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the amniotic fluid in the womb, and that it can be easier to get used to water.
In principle this is logical, since from birth to first pass swimming just 2 weeks.
"That is not enough time to get something to forget," says Marina Aksenowa baby swimming instructor.
While gravity is thus a much more natural state for a newborn child, the woman can not do without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles begin to really fast and thus also decreases the ability to deliver the baby.
Well, we deal with the birth introductory resource.
The birth could take place, for example, in a special chamber to deliver the baby.
"But what happened then?" Says the not insignificant question of Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the pull of gravity, the body can not form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child can not be placed as an adult to workout in a stress suit in orbit.
It is simply missing, which is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment we make together, namely, the birth of a child in a strange environment, will mean that we will bring a disabled person, a completely maladjusted people to the world", says the head of the Bioethics Commission at the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor pestov, ahead.
So far, the birth of children in the universe mere theory.
Sometime it is reality but when the earthlings set off in their ships to a distant planet, which is the home for their offspring born in space.
