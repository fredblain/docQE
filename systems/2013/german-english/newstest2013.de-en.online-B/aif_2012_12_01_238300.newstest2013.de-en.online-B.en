"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow : Migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil discuss what benefits the law on mandatory language tests for immigrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia : Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the upkeep of the family remaining in the home.
On 1 December a law came into force, which states that any migrant worker a test of knowledge of the Russian language certified, must pass.
Previously, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the local housing industry and retail services sectors.
However, the tests should be compulsory with time, according to Federal Migration Service for all future guest workers.
One has to not only take language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of the legislation.
Language skills must be provided for both the receipt and the renewal of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also excluded from this law are people who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense problems and protect the rights
The whole of the examination bodies will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities and even now more than 160 centers have been appropriate in Russia opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
Contrast, civil rights presented before the enactment of the law in the press several times the following question : What makes the whole thing?
What changes does the requirement to have to show language skills both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Especially, spokesman for the reply migration authority, it is a matter of reducing the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the Head of the Representation of the Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected prior to their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without occupation, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants will inevitably encounter without knowing the language people with evil intentions, which put him under the guise of aid in a dark, narrow barracks where he persevere with dozens of his peers months without food or documents and 12 to 14 hours will toil day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, you will be the one promised, and upon arrival you will be cheated to get their passports taken and did not receive the promised reward," says the head of the Main Administration for labor migration of Tajik Migration Service, Tolib Schwaripow.
Do not scold, boss!
Nevertheless be many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money, that they do not speak not only the language of the destination country, but also in their own language can hardly be expressed in writing.
Of course this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil : Few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only afford a reasonable primary education.
Because their families can not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children then immediately take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without knowing the language," they give.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Emphasize civil rights law regarding the following important aspect.
Must pass the test only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, so there is no check and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers has continued illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Unauthorized access prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and of course the language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money : 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents mostly fake and we are not registered, and then emerge from cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow told journalists expressed.
"Just no cost for false papers shy"
Already on the day on which the Act came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be faked.
Some fake certificates, certifying the completion of the language tests were already fogging taken by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The fake documents were printed with a standard color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not in vain this : Every migrant who hoped to thus saving themselves the tests, paying seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the test official : It costs a migrant three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption to ensure that licenses can not be purchased easily, both officers and civil rights are in agreement.
For the moment, the authorities of guest workers who fall through the test the first time, just promise that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers are offered without knowing the language points in areas where there is no active communication with people is necessary.
