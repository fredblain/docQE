A Constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration that temporarily suspends all powers granted to him more than ever remains divided, he has decided to put everything on one card.
To everyone's surprise he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt the next day its final version.
Just a week ago, the head of state this Chamber had granted two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt for nearly two years now, is based on a provisional, multiple amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has provided for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the President remains in his "autocratic Delirium" by continuing "breaking his word" and "the law tramples".
On the part of its supporters have been assured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and speed up the transition process.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to abandon their plan, the text explaining the Egyptians, section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to find his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging across the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably.
Especially since the Egyptian people with this Resorting an ultimatum is placed on a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my design or do I keep the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration mid-November, they have turned away because they feel that they have not been able to bring their perspectives to bear.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities and civil society alike have traded.
Were to achieve the quorum yesterday morning in a hurry 11 people, alternates added.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining way, that the only difference of opinion of the day... has come in the time of prayer expressed, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, finally remains identical to that of the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had hoped "the Principles" be replaced by "the rules", which would have made possible a stricter application.
For the Islamists, is the fact that this article was not changed, a proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" return the liberals who see this as a propaganda blow.
Because according to them is the Islamization of the Constitution on other items.
They have particularly in mind Article 220, the Al-Azhar University confers an advisory role, particularly in relation to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is troubling since " are the persons who will be invited to provide comments, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You may herein see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university will be much less moderate than the present.
"Currently, no specific religious commitment can be seen.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked in this text are not ulema, but academics who have been trained in the French system of " appeasing Alexis Blouet to write a doctoral thesis about the Egyptian Constitution transition.
But he admits that " in terms of Article 220 of the ambiguity may exist, as the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [ Islamic jurisprudence, ed ].
And in the future, the question might be raised as to what extent civil courts are competent to decide. "
In addition to its religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized because of the far-reaching powers it grants the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that these are compared with the former regime significantly reduced.
Another point of contention : the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military examination of the defense budget is not submitted to Parliament, but on a national defense council.
There will also be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have called for the defense of human rights.
The latter also share their concerns about the text that they see as threatening freedom.
The offense of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are forbidden now, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no article on the protection of women's concerns, highlights Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television yesterday evening, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will parade Saturday.
