A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter to be a myth by reiterated that the election fraud in the U.S. is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of the way Republicans have found in 10 years in the U.S., only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the USA 's democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states for the conduct of the elections in each country are responsible.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 has announced new laws that complicate the procedure for registration or ballot.
This phenomenon has gained after the elections of November 2010, meaning, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which may restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, the time periods for early voting are also reduced by these laws, the law declared invalid to register on election day as voters and citizens denied the right to vote, for which a court file.
Before the elections of 2006, no U.S. government has requested that the voters show off a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state, which has raised such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years they promoted in 34 states draft laws, which the voters are forced to show off a photo ID.
It is important to note that the U.S. citizens as opposed to Quebec do not have a universal health insurance identification card as the card.
In fact possess 11% of U.S. citizens, ie 21 million people eligible to vote not issued by a government authority of their state photo ID.
They also feature five million new voters in 2012, does not have such a card.
However, often more than one hundred dollars to be paid to obtain the required ID.
Limitations of the new young people, minorities and people are disproportionately affected low-income.
In fact have 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than$ 35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
The students who are considered voters who cast their vote for Democratic candidates increased, it is not allowed in several states to use their issued photo ID from their facility.
On the other hand, allow members of the same States fishing or hunting clubs that choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state has called for choosing a proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, which introduced such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly from it, limiting the Hispanic vote.
For it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have sponsored legislation in 2011 in eight states with which the registration of voters was abolished on election day.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups is limited, those voters to provide assistance that would like to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration drives in the general elections in 2004 helped to register about 10 million citizens.
Because the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 decreased by 17% by the measures adopted since 2009.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed in five other states laws that aim to shorten the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance, African- Americans, although they make up only 13% of voters in the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, making the whites, who constitute 76% of the voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the veto of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage partially.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the option.
Democratic critics decry the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear objective to influence the results in the crucial states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 ballots amount required in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on electoral system a significant impact on the outcome of presidential elections in 2012 will have.
But one thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the USA 's democratic system.
