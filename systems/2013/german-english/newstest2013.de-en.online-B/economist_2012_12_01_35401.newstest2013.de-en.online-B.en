Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hopes.
Amidst the usual recriminations countless buildings were reduced to rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time are rockets from Gaza near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem taken.
However, although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East changed around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation and whether they like it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor gained
At first glance, seems optimistic given the current situation is anything but appropriate.
Even when the 21 November continues cease-fire, which this week's battles have strengthened the tough guys on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will say that they have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group had recorded huge losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza are crammed into one of the most densely populated desolatesten and corners of the planet, it is Israel up to now failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins added in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leader could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
So how Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract rich and powerful friends on their side.
Turkey, a reviving, regional power that was once known as Israel 's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that to Israel is an Islamic Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly Islamist tischeren character could stand before the overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Mursi - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on the southern edge of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainable.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his overthrow in 2011 ruled for 30 years, very little time was left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is related by Hamas and its leaders more dependent on people views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove as a player who can not be pushed out even from Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, however, can draw an opposite conclusion.
Militarily speaking, Hamas is no more danger.
The Israeli missile defense system "Iron Dome" has to prove themselves, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep soundly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States steadfastly hold to their position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a large extent.
Although rockets have killed in the Gaza Strip since 2004, about 30 Israelis, the country is relatively remained free of suicide bombers - not least because of the barriers, the inside run in the West Bank and therefore into the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which, although declared illegal under international law, but are always expanded.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud party in the run up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman allies with an even more combative group.
Why coddle these deceitful Palestinians and leave them a state of their own?
If they were actually in control of the West Bank, they would not like their colleagues in Gaza also fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them at bay behind the wall and punish them should dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners to enforce. But the Arab Spring could make them a spanner in the works.
Even if the Islamists who now sit in Egypt and other countries in power, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the problems in their own country.
The Israeli defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economies.
That the pragmatic President Mursi teamed up with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, as this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.
The suppression undermines already democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody suppression missions to Hamas in Gaza are increasingly taking their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need an external stimulus
The correct answer is the one that is represented by the rational representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this newspaper : Two states in which Israel cedes areas for security purposes.
The - small for the near future - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders granted more influence to implement this solution.
Egypt now has to stop the flow of weapons into the Gaza Strip together with Turkey and Qatar and is better positioned than ever to Hamas to the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by exchange of territory and a shared Jerusalem, convincing.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah reached an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state as the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also do its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems like he would be as averse to a stake.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a substantial interest in a stable Middle East.
And part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
