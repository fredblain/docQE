The hardest job in the world : the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros put the support of the Indonesian volcano their lives and health at risk if they carry 70 kilos of sulfur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are working literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn their living by bringing sulfur from Kawah Ijen volcano in East Java, Indonesia.
This he must descend to the bottom of its crater, where the effluent from the earth solidified sulfur- containing gas in contact with the air every day.
Having broken out large stones sulfur, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the steep paths of stone.
Although there are just 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the depleted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in turtle pace as they keep the balance and have to put their steps carefully, so they do not slip and fall.
You know that each step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every pound of sulfur, which they break down.
Once at the top, they are making their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiresome heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that has a mining company a little further up at the bottom at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi that the deposits in the volcano and (never better said) exploits its workers since 1960, where she (5 euro cents) pay 662 rupees per kilo Indonesian sulfur.
They then sold each for 10,000 rupees (83 Euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks accessories, cosmetics, and even dynamite to bleach sugar.
"We usually carry 70 kg, we obtain for each path about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," Anto, which makes three routes a day normally explained to us.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day, he then 138,000 rupees (â‚¬ 11.5) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort, but is three times of what he would earn working in the field.
"The daily wage of miners here, where at the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be paid on the day and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," said the carrier on previously as a bricklayer the tourist island of Bali worked.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto with his family to Banyuwangi, a village in the vicinity, returned, and for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulfur is : "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I have brought them to Java, to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases.
The 27- year-old Anto three years puts his life on the line at Kawah Ijen, the sulfur has already left the first traces in him, though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work here for two years, because I open a shop or would like to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This charming and intelligent, but punished by life young man could work as tourist guides, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of carrying donkey.
He shares a filthy wooden hut with other carriers and is available each morning for two clock because the sulfur is also flowing at night, where its characteristic yellow color of bluish shining in the darkness.
The shadows challenging, it rises in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money into the crater.
Approximately 400 load carrier at the bottom of the crater with sulfur baskets on their shoulders.
Despite their large profits the mining company has not mechanized mining sulfur in order to save costs, and delivers the bodies that work on their own account and will be paid by weight, no equipment.
You also get no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera fee, collected from the guardian of this nature parks together with the entry fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) of the tourists who and for photographing the volcano human carrying donkey come.
"This work is not for the animals and for the people" protested Madrusin, a burly, 42 -year-old carrier since leaving school operates three decades at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he will continue "as long as it is", because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged 10 to 18 years of age.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the eyes and throat itch when the wind suddenly turns and the miners trapped in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains of serious diseases... except of course the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and blowing on the shoulders, which have deformed the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back Unainik is to carry 50 kg, 53- years nurmehr able.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by trucks over a three goat path between the bushes to camp in Tamansari in 18 miles away.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth missing.
Of his five children, the eldest is working with his 30 years as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the poverty keeps generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who Ijen working as human beasts of burden at Kawah.
