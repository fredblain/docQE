The story of a compound that overcomes more than 8733 km.
First there is the pitching : Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and Mr Slipper search on the parquet floor of the clock to find him quickly.
One-two- three - four.
Then only the singers' voices swell slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - harry, beguile and traced.
Fiete and Hopf, the 29 -year-old conductor, it raises almost out of his cloth shoes when he brings them together with its supple wild gestures.
It's Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology, Heidelberg Imbongi the choir is rehearsing a new song.
About fifty singers have come, 23-69 years old, by the human geneticist to home.
