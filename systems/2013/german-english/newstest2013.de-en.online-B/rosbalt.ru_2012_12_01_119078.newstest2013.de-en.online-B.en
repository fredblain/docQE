Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt implementing the project "Petersburg avant-garde" continued dedicated city dwellers who form the vanguard of art and culture.
On the fine list already landed high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the limits of the city, and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red that is found once at the Russian Museum, once the summer garden, meeting times at scene or at openings.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also be issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical social- philosophical Petersburg artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde late 80s or early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures through his presence on the road to his fellow citizens a smile on your face and makes them in a good mood.
He recently grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petrograd barrel organ player, he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artistic life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always on the go in red and not, for example, yellow or turquoise in town?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, all calls, which is slightly different from the standard gray, aggression and bad behavior out.
But I want to come by my provocations with people this week.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation for an interview.
- When did you know that you have to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Nevsky, when my work was exhibited.
I realized that I have to go this route.
Then the time of the ancient free, but not officially recognized painter was then ended, and painters such as new and free I were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, that the representatives of the "Gazonewschina" him to create "Puschkinskaja 10", and was once the end.
I am drawn to the theater, to fashion, to music, actually everything except literature.
- And all the combined type in your clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there were renovations to the club for a musical and artistic bohemians, the home of the St. Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there : NOM, Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and them was the now trendy composer Igor Vdovin.
As the group began to play live, was from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of "Halli Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and there began his great career, but the principles he learned from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art Clinic.
There went our staff and patrons.
I am a hero of the past century, as a culture still meant something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press, in which it "personalities of our city," went for the award.
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times by old rules, I 'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same : One can be famous without thereby making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring clearly the relevance and clarity of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares afraid to be so.
In a clown that blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by requiring that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is based on the exterior and not the interior of man.
But maybe you should not shake hands with a man, but should spit in his face.
The illusion disappears through the dressing.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban street organ player. - A city of culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can also commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial art has to be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people formed large groups : the bohemians loved the one and the other the common people.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred -dollar bill, which everyone likes.
Now you have to think about you, who you 'll like it.
Now everyone cult star has about 100 followers.
- To appearances by Stas Mikhailov, but more thousands!
- To him, women are abandoned, there the sexual- social sphere plays a role.
300 people are on cultural grounds and not 10 thousand, thus there is less management, money, and everything is ruined.
I have followers, and the important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I have painted such pictures hanging in a collector even in line with the work of Falk and Larionov.
I started with images that usually come at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumer has no culture, that is something else entirely.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money to paint can.
This is the culture, which I support.
- Kirill thing missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
One said : Diener is Culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real Czar it was different, because the Tsar understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what could be the experts, but they are the way is blocked, since it requires hochrangigerer experts who evaluate the former right and pave the way for them.
Now only one 's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some artists therefore have to look for other museums.
- What is your idea Petersburg?
- Petersburg is the cultural capital, in Moscow, there is much more culture and a corresponding culture medium.
On our stones, art can be difficult to grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right yet.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
For us, these are much less.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
