The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as the basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed at all the people, but especially well to the Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For they all, yet hopelessly divided opposition in a confused, scared.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had said Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologetically, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed and extended its expertise, "to save the revolution."
But what the 61 -year-old engineer, who has a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California, really want to save it to the Egyptians, is the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be overthrown?
In fact, the 234 articles that were pushed through because of the Islamist- dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a night, 15-hour tour de force, some are worrying.
As in previous constitutions also says the design, the case-law founded on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal scope for a strict interpretation of Sharia law.
This raises at least a newly owned items close : in all matters relating to the Sharia should be considered the Al Azhar University for advice, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great charisma in the entire Sunni Islam.
That does not, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would have the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary to follow.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic : The civil military justice should remain sustained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The state should also, as it stands in the draft, "the true essence of the Egyptian family" protect "and its morality and its values ."
This is put in legal terms so blurred that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain English, this means nothing more than censorship.
No item by the way writes explicitly the equality of men and women.
This forbids another to insult the Prophet Muhammad and His messengers or slander.
What is an insult and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Likewise seems dubious to the formulation that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Enough there already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of lawyers?
Matter of interpretation, like so much will be "very soon" presented in the draft, which is available for signature Mursi and in his words, the Egyptians referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is forming for weeks against the superior power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter to the case before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has come back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third place in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft Constitution belongs "to the rubbish heap of history."
Via short message service Twitter he accused the followers Mursi's trying to lead a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said the opposition Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for," the media quoted the Egyptian opposition politician Khaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum does not want to watch, so it would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to counter-demonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part and shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded Mursi : "Clear the land!" and protested : "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir square, where it all began, would have probably conjured up of a civil war.
The Mursi's followers did not want to risk obviously.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents have expressed loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the design of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word is not even before human rights"
Hafez Abu Saeda is going mad about this more aggressive constitutional process, which actually would have until February and all social forces are integrated.
The 48 -year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they sat under Mubarak in prison or on trial.
Because he would not share their beliefs, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
But he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now the word is not even human rights in the new constitution," he complained in an interview with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi power extension to all three powers of the state could give up the lawyer.
These measures are flagrant violations of the rules of democracy and Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President put them de facto suspended", complains Saeda.
But without civil society organizations can not function a democracy.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which considers the direction of ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
One protester in Tahrir warns : "You gives birth to a monster you can not control."
