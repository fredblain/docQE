SAO chief: the Black control system failed due to the fault of the policy
Czech Republic has in the context of public procurement on good policing and adequate legislation, however, will fall back into their application.
In an interview for this Aktuálně.cz says the vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, SAO), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is not perfect, but it must be used correctly - and this is my opinion, not the case with us," Kala says the current situation.
A similar result is also apparently a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example, he leads the practice setting of Prime Minister Petr Necas called for "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS, the entrepreneur would not bother with controls - so the system is now banned or allowed?
"A law must still have its validity, and if something is illegal, it can not just government chairman come and impede Control Board, whose duty is, after all, the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Chamber of Deputies They talked about a joint Czech- German project, under which the laws of both countries regarding public contracts were compared.
Worum d es da konkret?
This is a parallel audit, with which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it comes that the European legislature determines how public contracts are to handle. Then build on national legislation. And finally, there is the actual practical application.
All this we have compared, and although the test is not yet complete, we found extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are with us maybe even a little "strict and perfect", but the actual application is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough, again setting new and more precise rules. One must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can you be of help to the project? What results from this project for you?
Just such a common control could help that we stop us constantly to seek to perfect the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this obviously does not affect particularly positive.
Economy means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and to exclude illicit enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will reach this goal.
Maybe it is so that we thus burdening the system with excessive "paperwork", and those looking for loopholes in the system, have it much easier to use the system as if the thresholds were higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there a similar authority as our SAO, or the system works differently?
As for the authorities, as is the German equivalent of the SAO, the Federal Court, which is constructed similar to us and also has a college which is formed only slightly different. Basically, however, both agencies work similarly.
Also the skills are comparable to some extent with Germany, however, is a federal state, ie that there is this SAI and in the individual federal states - in the German system differs from our.
The BRH may control only federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds that are managed by us at the districts and communities, there are the control of the national audit offices.
As to the German legislation, is the easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this with no concrete information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a role model in some respects, but determines where you can not say that Germany is better at everything.
Is perhaps the fact that there are examiners better?
The not determined, but as I said : Such comparisons I do not particularly like.
For this purpose, it should be noted that even those countries that are a model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they would not know anything about working with our agency, right?
With regard to the Czech legislation, which had significance for the amendment of their authority to the Procurement Law, you already feel any effect?
Given that this amendment has only been in force, it affects our tests so far from not.
Since our controls are in place subsequently to be reckoned with here with a certain delay.
Effects we feel far more in the preparatory phase controls in future - so we have the new instrument of control "identification of risks of inefficiency" is introduced and tested with this nearly 14,000 public contracts and analyzed - here the changes are, of course, affect, since change the thresholds, the conditions for certain species have been modified by including calls
See the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system charged with additional bureaucracy?
I think that by this Act is a step in the right direction and I hope that this notion.
However, the problem may arise that the rules of "strict" are and can no longer be maintained.
Already under the previous rules are the one under test persons relative to the carrier (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect accountable that any non- compliance with the Public Procurement Act a breach of budgetary discipline equals.
But then it is sensible to make the law more stringent?
I do not think this way.
The system must exclude those who attack and try to abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a procedural defect that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out here?
We say first of all, what path is not purposeful.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother with the entrepreneur controls the so-called "Black System" - what does that mean exactly?
Black is the system now banned or allowed?
A law must still have its validity, and if something is illegal, then the government can not just come Chairman and impede Control Board, whose duty is, after all, the monitoring of compliance with the law, in its activities.
He can say, "We will change the law and allow the thing," but he can not say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the bidder with the best offer will be excluded solely on the basis of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly - and that is what we lack in my opinion.
