My Mexican- American identity crisis.
Many people were forced by the lack of opportunities to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times to mind, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at passport control, when perplexity wide made in me.
Signs refer to two queues : one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of what I should put myself.
I grew up in Central California, and was long known as "Mexican" my whole life.
An ethnic symbol - just as my friends in Boston to call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later I decided to "Mexican - American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent I can not help also.
So I took my American passport and stood in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week, as the future president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda all those topics that one would expect if the heads of the two countries meet : immigration, drugs and trafficking.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that Mexicans remain today with just as likely in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modeled on the European Union.
Pena Nieto and vowed to continue the war against Mexico's drug cartels, even if he called no related details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought in mind that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico, and the country's leadership to under gunpoint forced to leave them for more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
Thus, once a U.S. government official also exerts only mild criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans beset the sovereignty of its neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma's go on the warpath.
Yet the biggest challenge in Mexico is truth in the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that a person at a point in our family tree - perhaps a parent or grandparent - no chance in Mexico, was offered and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this corresponded to a person profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our allegiance is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, good schools attended and get good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes possibly blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
When our family would not have failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not see us trapped behind the silk curtain - lost with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - evil and Mexican Americans take them this.
While she is U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging to neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte but also Bruce Springsteen.
You can enjoy the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
How should I learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated : some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated middle class to record their links with the diaspora again.
You want to use Mexican Americans as a temporary "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leadership to strengthen their ties to Mexico.
Well.
That will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the inequitable distribution of income, the rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if it really is a great country.
I 'm afraid you have just by, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for that cherish as their family members were treated until not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "Mexican" than I thought.
