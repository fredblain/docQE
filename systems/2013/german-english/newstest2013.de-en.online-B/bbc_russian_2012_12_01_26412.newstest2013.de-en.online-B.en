In recent days there was anywhere in the USA to massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will further swell or if you again soon run out of air.
The protests are supported by several trade unions and left-wing non-profit organizations.
Besides increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers follow the organizers of the protests aim to form unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, the United States took place at the sellouts that attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to melee.
On this day, put some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, down their work and went on strike together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain whose target group are low and middle income people.
Walmart sells all products of diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Goods in Walmart stores is on average 8-27% lower than in large supermarkets.
Why buy a lot of slightly paid Walmart employees only in their own workplace.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the U.S..
Critics Walmart may only sell the goods as low therefore often because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of severe working conditions, such as lack of forklift or hand-held scanner.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday," demanding wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's own health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month was up.
A typical Walmart employee who earned 9.5 U.S. dollars an hour, this increase could not afford, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company's average wage increased to$ 12 an hour, it would cost$ 3.2 billion Walmart.
That is about 1.1% more than they now donate to pay.
Walmart would completely swing the wage increases on to customers, any future purchase cost them only 46 cents more.
Per year that would be for them compared to today overspend of just 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart notice satisfied that there were protests in only nine states and the companies they bestowed no losses.
Black Friday took to his store of 8 clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart Cash led the "Black Friday" from almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees stopped work and the protest action only "another PR trick" of the trade union, the protests, the organized, was.
"Free Checkout"
The protests went on in New York this week, where their goal but not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this progressive city and therefore are non-existent so far), but were McDonald 's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billion servings, and yet you are granted no sick days, and you will not get paid for your honest work!

Currently, the minimum wage is in accordance with federal and New York law at$ 7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and in their simple average employee get in New York 8.90 U.S. dollars an hour.
No less than they deserve in this expensive city.
How is it possible to do in New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was once a time in which stood nearly a quarter of all U.S. teenagers after school at McDonald's behind the counter, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planning to stay there longer.
Now I constantly encounter in interviews with employees of McDonald's people who complain that they get along with this job and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is the forum of the Wall Street Journal a comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, the morning before started on Thursday at 6.30 clock McDonald's, 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of$ 15 an hour, which is more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate management to stand in the way of this goal and admonish or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is difficult but also objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
dissatisfied
Loud protests took place on this day also from many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protest was a gathering at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council Member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billion servings, and yet you granted you no sick days, and their will not pay for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food employee so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, the every New Yorker deserves".
According to the New York Times it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the spot, by far not all of them are employed in the fast food industry in which to work in New York, tens of thousands were.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize all the masses.
