Rakfisk from Norway : Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but around the world.
Could the secret to the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty smelly fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
They Placing beneath a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And just leave it there for a week.
How about you have to imagine the smell of nasenbetäubenden Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and this persistent smell in the air that just will not go away.
Rakfisk is sprinkled with salt trout, which - depending on how smelly you would like to have his fish - is fermented for up to a year in water.
When in Norway darkness comes over the land and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this, well, really very impressive specialty.
"You eat it raw and then washed it down with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen who actually works at the local fire station, but as a "Rakfisk - General", the festival also hosted.
All around us people eat small fish cubes and to take large amounts of alcohol.
"People like the cufflinks aquavit over the Rakfisk" says Havard.
The spirit may displace the smell.
I taste some appetizers.
If you avoid going to bring the nose Rakfisk in close, he is not bad - such as sushi, which has a fairly long bus ride behind.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era when there were no cooling facilities and fish was soaked in salt water fall in air-tight barrels.
In the dead of winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and - undoubtedly under damped by using alcohol senses - consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians saw in search of work forced to leave their land and migrated mainly to the USA.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, lured by the burgeoning labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even in Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer Not too long ago as Norway, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes that you can buy here.
But actually everything is so expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich proud costs 10 euros.
Norway can not make it often in the world press, and most people do not seem to mind that.
Here you can still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists, the 77 men, women and children shot and killed last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident of 22 July".
Norwegians seem to be able to accept that someone is capable in its peace-loving country to such brutal murders.
The main reason for today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays spread with seasoned Rakfisk and with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are a - how to say - prudent people.
Your English is just like that of most people here immaculate.
We are not very pretentious, we do not like bravado.
Norway is handled very carefully with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry income is invested for the benefit of future generations into a special fund.
Than in all the years up to the Great Depression threw money around that they do not possess, Norway kept his wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we go skiing in the winter and can go hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk" she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and put myself for another dish - from Rakfisk I 've had enough.
So a moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat tastes good to me.
But the evening is once again the stinky fish on the menu.
The hotel in which I enjoy to, is one of several venues that organize Rakfisk a dinner at which guests for the best - fish can agree - or perhaps the sense of smell the most challenging.
There is a live TV service to an emcee dressed in bow tie, surrounded by plates of Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Euro Vision Song Contest.
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor -Juergen?"
"Here are our points Havard".
Clapping and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it's the severe haze of whole fish.
