Australian cigarette packaging laws for uniform contact force
Health Warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first uniform laws for cigarettes and tobacco packaging are in force in Australia. Thus, brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive green cover, which are also printed with dramatic images that show the diseased body parts and sick babies and children caused by cigarette smoke.
Of the different health warnings and images aside from next Saturday is the only difference between the packages in the brand names that are printed in an identical, small font.
Thus Australia introduces the world's most stringent rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by the glamorous image of smoking is eliminated.
The government of studies is based, have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke at 26, with 99% probability no longer be after start.
"You can already see in children young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies try to compete with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will be very little impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
It was said that the laws would the black market trade favors, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes lead.
"The laws will result in serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover the unbearable packaging have risen enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago supreme Court of the Australian failed with their appeal against the laws.
Zico had sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale shops and wait for new stocks.
For us this is a good deal.
According to experts, the catch lies in the popularity of social media in exactly the population, which are addressed by the plan.
A number of Australian laws has tobacco companies banned from TV advertising, forbid them to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to interpret cigarettes in stores any longer. Now the tobacco advertising has changed the Internet.
The Australian Government has internet advertising prohibited by local businesses and pages, but has no influence on the international pages.
"Who has marketed tobacco and only a small area left to promote its products, can not get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has noted an increase in reports of experience to brands that were written by "normal people".
One has to ask the question: Is this just a private person who finds so much pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she takes this even a video - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead concentrate on marketing it to deal with the new laws.
She's even gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries engaged in major trade with Australia.
A WTO ruling is expected in mid 2013.
According Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, which prescribed photographic warnings.
Meanwhile, these including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine were extended to more than 40 countries.
Tougher laws are being considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show defiantly.
The pictures do not affect me.
I simply ignore them.
"You just take a dump and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a pack of cigarettes on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade, "King of the Pack" in the city of Sydney, says the uniform packaging made it difficult filling its shelves.
"In the past I have used one hours in which to place a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should simply ban cigarettes completely - then we would have told us okay, that's it, we make tight," he adds clearly added angrily.
