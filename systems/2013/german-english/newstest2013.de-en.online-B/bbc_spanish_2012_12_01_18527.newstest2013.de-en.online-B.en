Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame that they have no children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the education of children.
"The population of Singapore has to grow."
I 'm a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic Wife: Are we fulfilling our civic duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mints, but nevertheless - or perhaps because - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
"Is pushing a" The sentences are part of a rap song, the local sayings such as bao " (loaf) in the oven in order to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising firm BBH, who shot the video, maintain hope that the commercial reaches a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Your creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is just something for the internet, so we had to make it funny and witty.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
During propagation, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic to which we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they do not necessarily lead to success.
Therefore, we thought : Why not make something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as to compose a rap?
1.2 children
Who takes this issue is not easy, is the Government of Singapore.
Every year it is 1,300 U.S. dollars for policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government grants for married couples and parents up to$ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, which is also known for his conservative government and its strict social controls.
Authority in accordance with its national population, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time was about 2 when this rate - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the Singaporeans more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of the national population authority says that this is a "better education" and was due "greater career opportunities".
"This has allows people except to marry and form a family a lot more options in terms of having to life goals and priorities," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single people and the postponement of marriage and births, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, led an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of the population, resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely -clad xenophobia against immigrants, many new flowers, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized because they keep wages low and not be integrated.
The increase in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year achieved their worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher contributions and deductions for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the known effects on economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve, that not so many small homes are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "shoe boxes" and could be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square meters, and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they may promote the lifestyle of living alone, and that they discourage builders from building large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Managing Director of real estate company EL Developers, says that getting his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are days and even weeks to sold out faster than the larger units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards provide clearer guidance to developers, which previously were obstacles placed in the way if they wanted to build too many small units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, refer to the discussions with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district, that they will not have a big impact.
"The people are very stressed out, the apartments and the education is expensive, so it is pushed by many" says a young manager.
Children can get.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man
Men and women carry on their career, the stress and the cost of the property and education as reasons why they can not have children.
Therefore, Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - because the government can still do so much.
