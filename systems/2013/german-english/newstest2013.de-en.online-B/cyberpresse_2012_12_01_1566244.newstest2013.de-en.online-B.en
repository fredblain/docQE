Das Higgs - Boson analysiert
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence from the standard model - was, but not yet observed empirically predicted - our best or "least wrong" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is similar to the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs boson strongly.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data, which were presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are still missing data in order to be completely sure about it.
Let us nevertheless assume that it is indeed the Higgs, since apparently only a low risk of being mistaken, and we look at what it is.
There is in this world a necessarily inevitable law, which means that two objects can not coexist in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and not try too hard, because you are going to hurt yourself.
Even if the particle is a really strange world, it turns out that they are also such a law applies: the Pauli'sche exclusion principle, which states that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in are the same "quantum state", which is "state" broadly from some of their properties.
Assuming the particles share the physicists into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are called fermions and obey the Pauli -like principle.
And in the other to move the bosons, an evil gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - definitely not this principle, which means that they can be located in the same place at the same time, in fact.
These bosons are divided according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing by the way) into two groups : the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "force particles", which spread through the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be emphasized, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to an extraordinary banality of boson : the photon or the "light particles", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If that is accelerating a particle with an electric charge or changing the direction of the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly in this place, something like a pebble that was tossed into a pond.
Through this "disturbance" created an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "holder of power".
stable field
The same is true for the Higgs boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs field has to be "disturbed" so that this boson shows.
However, the Higgs field is much stronger than the electromagnetic field, the pathogen must reach a little like a frozen pond whose surface could be furrowed only by a very large rock very high energies.
Therefore, a giant particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - To achieve such high energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field, in fact.
Some, like magnets do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never think of yourself on the refrigerator.
And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field : those who do it have a mass, while the other (just like the photon) have no mass.
For what all this research can now "be good," Ms. Plamondon ask?
For science, they are designed to review the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to investigate any discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM accurately.
Incidentally, there are many physicists who fervently hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major shortcomings, as it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter in the universe (again ups!).
However, at CERN such differences were not found until now.
effects
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were none.
Incidentally, in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Labs have not believed that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and in 1962 even the first continuous-wave laser (the first were pulsed) has developed - already said that the laser was viewed more as a "laboratory" games at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can result from all of the instruments that surround the research.
For example, turn in 1969 developed a small light sensor during his work in optics Willard Boyle.
Although it was not the original purpose, all digital cameras, this sensor is now used worldwide as "eye", and in 2009 earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics.
Of course this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know...
