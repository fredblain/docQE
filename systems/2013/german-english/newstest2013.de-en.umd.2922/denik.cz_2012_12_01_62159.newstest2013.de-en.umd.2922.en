šImon Ornest: on our concerts, we want positive energy collection
What do you think that the world should take place in less than a month?
This is one of those disasters reports to the people we like function.
We make with our band the tap tap more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which can gather enough positive energy in order to prevent or to stop the world.
achieve a unique project with three concerts in December against the world.
Can you imagine our readers the project closer?
It is a nationwide fundraising event we plan two years.
We want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which end on 21 December is forecast at 11: 10 a.m..
The day before, on 20 December, from 21: 00 p.m. at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of concerts should be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies before us in a time zone to 12 hours, the Mayan calendar ends.
Where did this idea come from?
Originally from me, then we have the idea together with our Grafiker Honza Augusta.
We would like not only sufficient positive energy, in order to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to consider, together with the public, the state in which we give our children about this world.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have a unique Kollektion of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters of the developed world, with their purchase on Www.E-Tap.Cz people can also support us.
The band the tap tap, together with other performers also called anthem against the end of the world comes with the title of 'world ".
The national anthem on YouTube is already very popular. They will also be at the fundraising concerts ring?
of course, and in the end, provided that all the work and the world does not take place...
The national anthem should be sung by all actors at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems in a direct line from the Czech television broadcast live.
The text of the anthem by Tomáš HanáK, who plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
As they have come to the cooperation with two?
We also cooperate with other figures in the Czech culture scene, was linked to the fact that we implement many fundraising events and concerts...
We are trying to integrate these people involved in our projects.
It has shown that the most interested in working with us, and have fun.
What is the proceeds of the benefit concerts against the end of the world?
for the establishment of a barrier-free education centre Studeo we already six years working together with the club tap JedličKa Institute.
the pupils of the JedličKa Institute are regularly cared for by teachers, to help them in various leisure activities.
As the pupils themselves do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the framework of the completion of the JedličKa Institute is a separate building in which we then with this project.
Each concert, several groups and performers.
According to what criteria they have selected?
We wanted to put together a programme that addresses all the generations including children.
For example, China in Prague ski, Support Lesbiens illu stratosphere with Dan BáRta, the tap tap, MariáN Bango and Jiří Suchý.
they know everything further on the website Www.Kpks.Cz.
similar "big events" are planned for the future?
We are for the first time in May at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States-then this would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
their overseas plans are not just small, yet they are already in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, the tap tap is composed of a group of people with disabilities.
as you travel this logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage area. We must also, of course, many instruments towing suitcases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, čSa and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I sometimes even surprised me.
Even in Moscow, where we were, there were no problems recently.
Through their travel abroad, they have a comparison, how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how we deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than us, especially in Russia, we witnessed that is still in its infancy in the East.
Moscow is absolutely not accessible to Prague. It is still unusual, if someone is travelling alone in a wheelchair in the city centre.
It is not even there, of course, that a wheelchair users, for example, in the lift.
Fortunately there clubs, too, trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
and in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things on which we depend on...
note, however, that an improvement in the situation is also always depends on the efforts of the parties concerned.
in London and Madrid, it is common for people with severe disabilities itself constantly in the public area can move into a museum, toilets etc.
But it is not just that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events with the band the tap tap slightly ahead of the West.
public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only if significant from our ranks athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers, are things really begin to change.
So far, only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The tap tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years: What has motivated in 1998, to set up a band?
I then began as carers in JedličKa Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in to deal with something hard.
Among other things, and because I am a musician and Saxofon Games, along with a colleague, I have established a music company.
and with time, as our host, LáďA Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs).
But the band was known only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us; we have also started to promote active for us.
we realised that if you are doing something and not to see this outwardly, their own performance, in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also make good teachers, high-quality equipment and etc.
It was their goal to bring it with the tap tap so far?
from the beginning, I felt the potential that we can tackle the things differently.
Often the other copies in show business today.
in its own way, it is only logical, because everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after some time.
There are few really unique things and, I would venture to say that it includes tap tap.
The first impression of the spectators usually has, naturally, is, of course, with suffering; this is just...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and deserted nature, which we regret.
There are people living a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities something, this is a step forward not only for themselves, but for the whole of society.
It was for this success, it is also helpful that a strict head, how many people are you listening?
If you want to make something good, in many things, we must not compromise and must also demand a certain discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they discover that they have twice the week test preparation must go and spend a lot of time to travel on concert stages, then quickly extinguished the enthusiasm among many.
But it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
Currently, the tap tap has 20 members.
How many of them were, from the outset, since 1998?
only one: LáďA Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go, we cannot prevent.
who has the will and the desire to participate, we always welcome.
