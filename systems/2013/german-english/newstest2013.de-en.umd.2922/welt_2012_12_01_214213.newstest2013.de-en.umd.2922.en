A search for traces in the country, are still relatively young in the 97-year-old.
The journey through the Talysch mountains is wild romantic.
The small bus Rumpelt rich on the curve of the road in the past, farmers sell rivers and simple houses in densely wooded hills.
everything is green and Saftig, one might think it would have been in the black forest.
But this is the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here, the Caucasian ethnic Talyschen, not much is known, except that she speaks perfect Persian and Aserisch and very durable.
terminus is Lerik.
The small city flaunts Wuchtig Geratener architecture from Soviet times, which is not in the picturesque mountain landscape.
tourists come from Europe is hardly onerous here to the journey of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
The 323 km you need eight hours, because the road is only one-sided.
The incredible wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is still not arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the stuff to tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May next year-and here we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the museum, the only one in the world for longevity.
This is the time you spent about eight dozen documented more than 100 Fatulayeva Talyschen from the area shows a black-and-white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
in 136 years of age a child conceived
But the museum is the controversial star shepherd şIrali MüSlüMov, the 168-year-old should be.
However, there is a birth certificate.
and, in the light of the oldest documented people, of the 122 years old has been, MüSlüMovs age seems extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explained Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years, he conceived a daughter.
şIrali MüSlüMov so his age by a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Many Hochaltrige people, there are also striking in some areas of China, Japan or the hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia life extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documents is not scientific proof of age, since register were missing.
Every day, bowl Geschmolzene butter
The fact is, though, that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often Biblisches age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why live here in the south so many high elderly?
The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains Talyschen with special genes.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that the food.
But that should be the calorie-rich diet of Talyschen as healthy, love meat, bread and above all milk products and many of whom drink a glass of Geschmolzene butter every day, not just from a nutritional point of view seems plausible.
or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
with its 97 years for this broad still comparatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, live in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
it is sitting on the ground with a butter barrel they tirelessly rolls out back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents.

In the kitchen, we are preparing the guests tea, in the typical, gut dip served poor Adu-glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Reih and link, hiding under her headscarf you long, dark skinned ZöPfe before US reveals proud of her son.
I always have my hair with milk washed, so they never me and kept their colour.
I also never used "shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
monthly pension is enough for life
It has only ever eaten, which came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
my whole life I have not bought a single time in supermarket food.
They then told by her husband, who was in the army.
It was worst in the period following the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyew took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult of the father of the nation, ruled the country as a dictator, knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
by 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there are no emergency Azerbaijan old.
230 Manat (Mirzayeva receives approximately the same amount in euros) a month as a pension, an amount for local conditions, we can live well.
and perhaps Mirzayevas has long Ergrauter son is right: "The old enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared for and are happy.
