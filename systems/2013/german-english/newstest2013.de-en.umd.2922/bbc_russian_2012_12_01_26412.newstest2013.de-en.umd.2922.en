Every fourth American young people sitting behind the pay of Mc Donald 's
In the last few days there was everywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Wal Mart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell and Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests will further increase or the air soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing non-profit-making organisations.
in addition to the increase of modest salaries of simple Walmart- and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents in a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called black Friday, the sales in the United States, the millions of customers Anlockten, which sometimes led to Handgemengen.
To this day, some Wal-Mart, with workers, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and Bestreikten branches of the chain, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, whose target people of low and middle-income.
Wal Mart, ranging from nappies on hunting guns and car batteries, all products sold to Staubsaugern, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Wal Mart branches is between 8% and 27% more on average than in large supermarkets.
Why buy many of the low-paid Wal Mart employees only on their own work.
the prices and the variety made Wal Mart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Wal Mart can sell the goods are often so favourable, because the workers are poorly paid.
The latter complaints about hard work conditions, for example the lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the operation of their own health insurance has risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Wal-Mart, with workers, $9.5 deserves the time, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley, show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Wal Mart 3.2 billion dollars.
The approximately 1.1% more than they now pay donations.
Wal Mart would pass the increases on customers, every purchase you only 46 cents more in the future.
per year would be for you today compared to more spending of only 12,39 dollars.
supporters of Wal Mart note with satisfaction that it only came to protests in nine states and the companies gave no losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop Thursday evening from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period Wal Mart sold approximately 5,000 articles per second.
Overall, Wal Mart-funds on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post, that "less than five" Wal Mart-staff laid down the work and the protest only "another PR Stunt," the trade union, the protests have been organised.
"Free cash!"
The protests this week in New York, where their goal but not Wal Mart branches (which are not wanted in this progressive city and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and others were cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sell billion chickens, and yet you provides no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.
New York City Council member Jumaane Williams
Currently, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour under federal and New York legislation.
in fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage and increased, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8,90 US dollar an hour.
Nobody in this expensive city less than they deserve.
as it is possible, in New York, with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's was behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.
hardly anyone saw is the main source of income or had to stay there longer.
now meet me in interviews with staff of McDonald's always people who complain that they do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper, the author points out, it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, which at 6.00 a.m. before the McDonald's on Thursday began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanding that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits it to stand in the way of corporate governance, this objective and trade unionists Abzumahnen or redundant.
On the other hand, the business leaders are not simply.
the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is difficult but also for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
unhappy
On this day, vocal protests, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The height of the protests was a house on at the McDonald's in Times Square, with some local Democrats languages, including city council member Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's says it sell billion chickens, and yet you provides no sick days, and will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, said that "we should work together to support the fast-food workers, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, the all New Yorkers deserve."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, of which by far not all in the fast-food industry, working in the tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise whole masses.
