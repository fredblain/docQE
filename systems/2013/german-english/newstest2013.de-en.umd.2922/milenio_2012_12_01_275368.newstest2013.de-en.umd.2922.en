"America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, of the sixth meeting of the presidents of the Union of South American nations (Unasur) Summit was held in Lima in Peru, told the state television that the Europeans "in the second world war and other conflicts were killing" and "are now virtually a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the members states of the Unasur.
"must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, however, there is still a reactionary sectors who want to see a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador, also supported the reform of the Organisation of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take account of those who have signed the San José agreement on human rights.
The lessons, never commit themselves to something, and, in return, we sign the South Americans always do everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and will be financed by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, has granted.
Correa stressed that he did not regret this decision, because it will not have betrayed his principles, but his "complied with deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there have been "well-founded suspicions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and non-compliance with the procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which he asked for him to submit to interrogation because of alleged sex crime on its territory, while the Swedish legislation allows it via a video conference on the embassy of Ecuador in London can be carried out. "
Correa said that the danger that would undermine the health and mental state of Assange.
"since he is in our message is, I have not talked to him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but it is not serious," said the head of Ecuador.
There is a danger, though, that he is physical and mental damage forgiven because he was caught in a narrow area and could not carry out physical exercises in free.
"It would be detrimental to the health of all people," he added.
Correa was that the solution to the asylum, Assange has been granted since the month of June in the embassy of Ecuador in London, the granting of a free letter which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of Europe's Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities. He emphasised that there have been talks with London in order to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of Wikileaks.
We do not act with human rights, we turn this word in this case not to have permanent talks.
"The solution for this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar GarzóN, a number of procedures at various European bodies," he said.
and "when Britain granted licence tomorrow, in my opinion, this is done."
and if Sweden Mr Assange at the embassy of Ecuador in London or on Skype VerhöRte made, as the Swedish law permits, and in other cases, was the problem.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that he will not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the sinister intention and the lie that infringe the freedom of expression."
"the biggest enemy of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists, the pursuit of profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador that not more of such journalists' and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and tables bourgeois countries', and I think he will be a re-election "will deepen the revolution in order to continue moving in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to veto against Paraguay in the Unasur maintain at least until the next elections, arguing that the legal body must remain "hard and no opportunism and no Verkleideten May coup d'éTat," because "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador is also keeping the desire his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, and now after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which before the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime legal limits between the two countries, for "absolutely justified."
This judgment will not be implemented at the moment.
It is a problem between a South and Central American state.
conflicts are inevitable, but it must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.
They must be dealt with, so that they can be overcome and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the sea border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said, "it is right for Latin America that recourse to international bodies, if both countries undertake to adopt the ruling, even if it is very harsh."
in relation to the possibility that he, as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third mandate in a row, he admitted that he "with a lot of optimism and joy this possibility, though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa promised that if he could lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
power has never interested me personally, but in such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the likely victory guaranteed, so I must fulfil this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I am back from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"It is decided," he said.
Correa also adopted to tackle the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I was with the vice-presidents of Venezuela, NicoláS Maduro. He told me that he went for a planned routine treatment that would have expected, and that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
"In any case, it means a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader adopted today in Lima on the sixth summit meeting of the heads of state and government of the Union of South American nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security.
