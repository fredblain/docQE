A Republican strategy to counter the Obama re-election
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policy with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan center the latter as a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States as the number of people killed by lightning strike.
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is for sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.
Unlike Canada, the United States responsible for the conduct of the elections in the various member states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments announced new laws since 2009, the procedures for the registration or ballot.
This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 seen new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 Bills introduced in 2011 alone, which limit the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present a photograph ID and proof of US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also shortened the time frames for the early vote, declared the right to register as voters on election day, and citizens are denied the right to vote, for which a court acts.
before the 2006 elections has no US-state of the electorate, a photograph card show.
INDIANA was the first federal state, has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law in Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed this practice extended to other states.
Over the last two years, they promoted bills in 34 states, where voters are forced into a photograph card show.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the citizens of the United States, say that 21 million voters who do not photograph card issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to obtain the necessary card to pay.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affects young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary light picture card.
This goes further.
The students, are seen as voters, their vote more for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photograph card issued by its establishment.
On the other hand, allow the same States members of Angel- or hunting clubs, choose the more on the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
In 2004, a federal state in which to choose a proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state to make such a request.
since 2011, a dozen states have laws adopted by the voters demand that they prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed to limit the Hispanic vote.
It is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters to the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators in eight states laws in 2011, which was abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups, to help those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to voter registration for the general elections in 2004, approximately 10 million citizens to register.
The measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote.
For example, in the general elections in 2008 were 33% of the electorate in Florida, have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they account for only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the white, 76% of the voters, only 46% of the electorate, in advance.
of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws, which restrict the registration of voters.
Several Bills have been blocked by the veto, the democratic governors.
The advocate-General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the displayed a photograph card.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
The Democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the outcome in key states for 2012.
A report of the Brennan centre of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, 171 men represent the 270 votes in the electoral body are needed in order to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine part of the democratic system in the United States.
