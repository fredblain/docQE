My between Mexico-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants-to remind them serious times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
I had on a recent trip to Mexico City has only just arrived into the hall and was at the passport control, I find.
signs pointed to two queues: one for "mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), the other for "Extranjeros" ("aliens").
I was there a few seconds long, uncertain, to which I should go.
I grew up in central California, and my life has been called "Mexicans."
An ethnic acronym-just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."
Later, I opted for "between Mexico-American."
But this was Mexico.
and in the home in my grandfather's day, there was no need for acronyms or Hyphenation.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish well enough, at least for me in this language at both ends of the interviews.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a mother spoke Lers and my American accent I will also not.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues which are expected when the heads of the two countries, immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today with the same likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He would ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc model of the European Union.
and Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war in Mexico against the drug cartels, although he gave no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans are probably never a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country, perhaps gun, forced to leave more than half its territory to them.
But for Mexicans in centuries and are not in minutes, memories of this event not to overlook.
Therefore, once a US government officials only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country's complaints about how the Americans press their neighbouring country's sovereignty.
monte cripple Zuma and the children are on the war path.
Yet, in truth, is the biggest challenge of Mexico in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
The inclination to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, provide opportunities for the country, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree of life a person-a parents' or grandparents' part, perhaps no chance offered in Mexico and in the north.
and in most cases, this person is a profile-dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to you.
not Mexico.
and though we might now live the American dream have visited, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, we live-not the Mexican.
our identity is sometimes blurred, but perhaps what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leaders may not.
This is based on reciprocity.
they see us as a monument of a humiliating defeat and looking down on us, because we are not between Mexico and enough.
Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our very existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families not failed, then they would not have gone in Mexico.
and then we would not see trapped behind the silk curtain-with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
my wife was born in Guadalajara and went to the United States legally as a child, I am reminded that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, also have a clearer idea of who they are, because Mexicans and Mexican Americans taking this evil.
While the US-American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, I know, have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band los tigres del norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we as Americans.
and we will be seen as Mexicans in the United States.
as I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complex: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora.
You want Mexican Americans as a provisional 'ambassador' for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues of how great a visit to this country and to exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
now.
that will not happen.
many wounded feelings.
and given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid, because you alone, Amigos.
that is only fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready for dealing with Mexico, the United States awarded to one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members have been dealt with until not so long ago.
hmmm.
Perhaps we are 'Mexican' as I thought.
