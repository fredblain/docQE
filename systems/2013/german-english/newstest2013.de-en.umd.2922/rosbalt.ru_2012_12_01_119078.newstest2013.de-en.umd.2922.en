its own taste rather than culture-Rosbalt.Ru
Rosbalt continued the "Petersburg vanguard" project, which is devoted to city dwellers, the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the elite list ended up already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the flamboyant artists Kirill Miller.
the whole town knows Kirill Miller, the Red-clad bearded, one time in the Russian Museum, the summer Garden, meeting with scene-or Vernis say found.
Wherever the images by Kirill Miller will also be issued to attract big crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s or early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and its citizens a firework through its presence on the road you smile in the face and makes for good humour.
He recently Schnappte turn an organ recital and Petersburg turn organ recital players, as he was for this difficult role in relation to be artists feel life, his philosophy and his image is finally ready.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city?
I chose the colour red than fashion designer, the deals with the optics and image.
in this world is red the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society.
The society calls for everything from the grey standard, aggression and bad behaviour.
But I do want my provocations come into contact with the people.
any of my last provocation was an invitation to talks.
- when Wusstest you, that you must be painters?
in an exhibition in the culture palace Newskij, were issued in my work.
I realised that I need to go down this road.
Then there was the time the old free, but not officially recognized painter to the end, and new and free painters such as I were incomprehensible.
I so friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was "Pushkin kaja 10" and then was only once.
i prefer it to the theatre, to fashion, music, everything except the literature.
in your way-- and all the United Hospital...-it was important to me, in the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a space in the Pushkin kaja 10, and there was a musical-artistic Club by the renovation work for the Boheme, the house of Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M. Tequilajazzz and I also remember how string with his "ucho van Goga" project there.
string and his friends wore simple songs to play back, close ones and sang to them was also the edgy composer Igor Wdowin today.
When the group began to play live, was its "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg facilitated many programmes before the time of "halli Galli.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, but the foundations got it in US.
The gallery also "d 137" or the club, "Griboedov" have their origin in the clinic.
There, our staff and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture is still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press, in order to award "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "artists of the Year ', and so I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times following the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: it can be known without a cultural contribution.
- your work have a distinctive style.
Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the timeliness and thoroughness of the idea.
I will be an exhibition, with the theme "the Russian museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
In the past I was socially, but now it pains and fear, to be the case.
blur in a clown all and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and bizarre ideas.
For example, we save the world by we require that everyone has fully to dress up.
Now, everyone on the clothing and focuses not on the external and internal.
But perhaps we should give people not spit, but he should face.
The deception disappears through the dress up.
We recently saw you in the role of the urban thing organ recital player.-a city should have a hero.
who, if not i?
- commercial art can also be beautiful?
- today must be careful of commercial art, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
In the past, people were large groups: the Bohemiens loved and the ordinary people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please all.
I am not one hundred-dollar note, which everyone likes.
Now you've got you will consider who you like.
Every cult star now has around 100 followers.
The appearances by STAS Michailow but several thousand.
- abandoned him to be women, where the sexually-social sphere plays a role.
300 people for cultural reasons and not 10 thousand, so there is less money management, and everything is.
I voted in favour, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy it.
in my youth, I painted such images in a collectors even in a number with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I began with images, which normally come only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
consumption has no culture, this is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money, in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture, which I support.
Kirill, what is lacking-Petersburg?
- good culture experts.
We say: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real czar, it was different, because the Tsars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are needed.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what could be the experts, but they blocked the road, because we need more high-level experts, which will evaluate the former right and pave the way for them.
now only one's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must therefore seek other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
Moscow-Petersburg is not the capital of culture; there is much more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones, art can only grow.
We need a cultural ground because, for example, we have now more writers than readers, and this is not right.
In Europe, there are many people who are curious, visit the exhibitions or concerts.
We are much less.
art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from grants the city of St. Petersburg
