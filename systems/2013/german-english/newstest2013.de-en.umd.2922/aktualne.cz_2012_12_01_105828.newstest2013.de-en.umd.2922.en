Nkú Chief: control of the black-system failed due to the fault of the policy
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but back in their application.
In the conversation for AktuáLně.Cz says the Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší Kontrolní úřAd Nkú), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly-and I think that this is not the case with us," Kala comment on the current situation.
A similar result also appears to have a common control by Czech and German examiners.
He leads a negative practice example the attitude of Prime Minister Petr NečAs for the so-called "black-system."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS entrepreneurs would not trouble with controls-so the system is now banned or allowed?
"A law must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, but is not simply the government chairman, and the control, whose duty is to hamper the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work", Kala.
They spoke at the meeting of the monitoring committee of the Chamber of Deputies about a joint Czech-German project, under which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
So what was it exactly?
there is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question that the European legislation, as public contracts to manage and build the national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application.
all of this, we have compared with each other, and, although the investigation is not finished yet, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, perhaps even "with US laws are strict and perfect ', but the actual application is better in Germany in some of the parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough, always new and more precise rules. We must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? What is for them from this project?
just such a common control could help that we stop constantly perfecting the laws in order to try and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this evidently not particularly positive.
efficiency means one thing to a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of the threshold values for contracts does not guarantee that we are achieving this objective.
Perhaps it is that the system in this way only with excessive 'paperwork', and those seeking loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, remained higher than if the threshold values.
you talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech law.
How does the system work in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our Nkú, or the system works differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent to Nkú the federal court that is built, and also has a college that is slightly different in principle both authorities to be formed, but similar.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, in other words that there is this federal courts in the individual countries, the German system is different from our own.
The Brh can only control federal funds, consistent with our national resources.
public funds, which will be managed by the counties and municipalities, under the control of the country's courts.
What the German legislation is easier than ours?
In general I would compare without specific information only reluctantly. Nevertheless, Germany is often described as a model in some ways, but it is certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better.
This is perhaps because the auditors are better?
Certainly not, but as I said, such comparisons may I do not particularly like.
This is worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us, also have problems to contend with.
Otherwise you would have nothing of the cooperation with our authority, not true?
What the Czech legislation, which was important for their authority to review the procurement law, feel they have any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is, in force for only a short time, it is not in our tests so far.
Since our controls take place, we must here with some delay.
We feel effects have so far been rather controls in the preparatory phase of the future-we have introduced the new instrument of control "identification of risks of waste," and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed-This will effect the changes, of course, since the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified and others
you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this adoption.
The problem, however, is that the rules can be "strict" and can no longer be met.
Under the previous rules are a test Unterzogenen persons against the winner (for example, in the event of the operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) accountable, that any failure of the procurement law is tantamount to a breach of discipline.
But it is useful to make the law more stringent?
I do not think this way.
The system must exclude those who attack and want to abuse the system, and not penalise those who have committed a mistake, not the actual decision-making.
Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say, first of all, what is not successful.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs would not bother with control of the so-called "black-system '- What exactly does this mean?
The black-system is now banned or allowed?
A Bill must have valid, and if something is banned by law, but it is not just the Government can control, whose duty is the chairman, and the monitoring of compliance with the law, in its activities.
He can say: "we need to change the law and allow the cause", but he can'T say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions-and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, but it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer simply because of procedural irregularities.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly-and I think that is what we are lacking.
