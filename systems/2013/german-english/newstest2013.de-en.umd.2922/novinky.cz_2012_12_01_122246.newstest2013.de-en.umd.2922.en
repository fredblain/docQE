directives for bubbles of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server Www.Bankovnipoplatky.Com, the annual survey on the oddest of bank charges, has decided that the competition this year, "most absurd regulation or idea-workshop" from the EU.
"This idea has brought us the plan put forward by the EU, a 40% quota of recently introduced in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, cares about the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
In the meantime, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they pose a lower risk for insurance companies objectively.
"Another incredible cases from the workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
One of the controversial EU regulations including the binding mixture of Bioethanol fuel in its wake, nature is harmful to the ban on the reliable contain mercury thermometers, only because this is a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on cages, but because of the size of chicken eggs this year were much more expensive.
criticism has in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "proliferation" or even the sales ban traditional light bulbs.
bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU machine decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in Brussels the rule of one or more member countries (for example, currently Czech Republic is trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks also veto-threat).
also lobbying interests were behind that bananas from the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and curvature anomaly "must not '.
The European Commission defended with the argument that it is only the fragmented national standards would impede trade Harmonisiere.
The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries have already been softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to the balloons in the sale must be labelled with the suggestion that children under eight years the air balloon without the supervision of an adult to bubbles.
The EU stood on a US study, according to the balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation of children.
A similar restrictions already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of the JahrmarktströTen.
There is also the strange thoughts at home
relatively absurd is also a directive, which concerns the European officials itself-each, an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece must not use the name Macedonia and must instead FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server BankovníPoplatky.Com nominee in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire, in addition to the above-mentioned also the absurdities of the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU, the highest volume of food stocks, on the day of our accession to the EU was located on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic exceeded the volume of canned mushroom, which we set out, for example, then a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money, but that they have no sea or from the idea of funding requests for aid.
But these ideas came not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage that we have no sea.
in the EU, we will apply for reimbursement, "he declared, in the autumn of 2004 the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (čSsd).
The argument he gave was that the grain harvest was very high and the state were overcrowded camps as a result of the intervention purchases.
Another way because the Czech Republic to the ports, according to Palas, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
Finally, the European Commission, the Czech Republic so far forward that they organised a contract on the purchase of grain from countries, which have no access to the sea.
requests for financial aid provided the communities under the auspices of the Ministry of regional development minister Pavel NěMec (US-DEU), it has to be means for the establishment of were requests to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
regulations in the member countries are easy targets for criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation and also to effectiveness and development for the whole of the European Union, deserves more recognition according to some experts.
These experts believe are a serious problem for the EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations have been imposed by individual member states.
emotions calls here also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight not always wins.
The Czech Republic has been following a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the name "Olomoucké TvarůžKy 'defend the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename" TuzemáK ".
The name rum must only be used for products from sugar cane distil at, not for products from sugar beet.
The official list of registered products in the EU are in the society of the world-famous cheese, feta, gorgonzola, the LüBecker Marzipans or the famous Parma now the karlsbad Zwieback PohořElice and TřEboň, carp, or the Saazer hops.
with an EU trademark since the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or boasting of the HořIcer roles.
