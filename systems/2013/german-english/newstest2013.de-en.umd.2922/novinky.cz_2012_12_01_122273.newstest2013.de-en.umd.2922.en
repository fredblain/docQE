"I want the people that the Republic save, but I am just an amateur," said Okamura.
Senator, how is the idea, to run for the office of the President?
It is not about me, Senator or president.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I would get nowhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic being plundered for 20 years, as thieves are walking around freely, while people's taxes and increasing the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be politicians.
But if I see something I do not like to propose a solution, then I try to change this.
And since I am over 40, independent and party, I have no other opportunity to influence things than to run for Senator or the President.
In the Senate, they have managed and then on the road to the castle.
Let it not your voters?
I have said all the time that I will take the fight to the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections in.
later clarified this and I said that I will run for the office of the President, if I am elected senator.
My aim is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realise my vision.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and as a strong mandate.
But the problem is not only that we as a people in the pub and the television rant, but any order, want to change something.
the media want to deprive the honour and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
I was claimed, for example, that journalists would bribe, or that I was Jiří Paroubek advisers.
We are talking about their vision.
The fight to have the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability and with retrospective assets declarations by politicians over 20 million kroner.
You will have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and the Senate as a whole only legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
as ordinary citizens, I argued that the tour guide is a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy-if someone from the right or the left is a good proposal is rejected, this deliberately, and considers the people only.
as an independent party-I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and dogmas of each party can take what is best for our country.
do they see themselves as man in politics, more to the right or left?
I am from the Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people see more to the left.
But for me this right-left think is totally unimportant.
For me, it is important that we can make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone to the left or to the right-wing camp; I would unite the people.
I support publicly any good solution approach, even if this always comes from the KsčM or of the ODS, and I will oppose bad ideas.
It is not you, if someone described them as populists.
But they did not confirm what you have just said?
If you have a business plan in a company, then you are an ideal target and a vision.
and they want to be closer.
Can I call it populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, functioning in the world already, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in parliament they just slogans.
and they are in politics not far in the long term.
or do you believe that you, when you talk only long enough with the people, we will be able, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
to convince politicians, journalists and the general public and to try to get them on our side, to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would be no problem for me, to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law.
and the raised would then say why they may reject it.
a strong personality, refers to maladministration can put pressure on the political scene.
You only need to look at the direct election of the president, which was a credit to the public pressure.
I would like to make it quite clear that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started with the policy and attempts to find the support of the majority, for my programme.
I always try to do things for themselves to judge; and if it does not work, then I am back in the private sector in six years.
The Czech Republic should save sounds a little, as if Okamura.
I am not a savior.
I know that I am hitting alone; I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether or not you want to run for the Senate.
I have, for example, with Radim JančUra, but rejected because of overwork.
I also support the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which exposed the fraud in the trade with easy fuel oil.
my candidacy, I started with the premise that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sixty per cent of the electorate, have not gone to the elections have mostly gone, and the elected representatives of the establishment.
We are only two independent in the Senate.
The people who have elected Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and district main men.
do you think about the creation of a separate party?
I have not thought about, because I have no time to review the past any potential party member, and certainly not the money.
I have not time money for the presidential campaign; at my transparent account only 20,000 Czk.
They have no money?
They speak of assets declarations, as would their?
I appreciate my private assets to about 60 million Czk.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, a housing for about 10 million, a further 8 million, an art collection, which is worth around 10 million and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and šKodu superb, worth around one million, and then I have a few million to the account.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream-James Bond always liked me, as it was in the car, Galant on women and, at the same time, fought against the evil.
They drive an Aston Martin have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for her campaign?
They say that they want to change the Republic, but you do not want to invest your own money.
This is not very convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make about debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my programme is not too much interest.
and I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will be basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senators content I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not to finance the English school, the cost of 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted money, I would stand for nothing.
They are further work as entrepreneurs, in order to have their livelihoods?
They said that they will drive back these activities?
But this is not with the level of salary.
As promised, I cut my activities in part.
For example, my deputy director of travel agencies in the spring.
People want to see me as Good Samaritans, saving the Republic.
But I must also bit of life.
You were used as entrepreneurs in which monthly income?
Around 200,000 to 400,000 and that is still the case.
But as President I think businesses would stop.
