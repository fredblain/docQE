old wars, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected pillars for peace
can it ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope to nip in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time, rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find their end.
A war lost or gained.
at first glance seems optimistic in view of the current situation is anything but.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group had even large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desolate and most densely populated corners of the planet will be loaded, it is Israel which, until now, has not managed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, the Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
and Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a revival, regional power, which was once known as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas party-as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that an Islamic crescent-Israel from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, Syria, where rebels an increasingly more Islamist-style StüRzung Bashar Assad's face, to Jordan, where Hamas allies could threaten the King.
President Muhammad Mursi and, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the inhabitants of most and most important Arab country-on Israel's southern flank has changed the balance of the region sustainable.
The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had only a little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood VerschwäGert with Hamas and their leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove the Hamas as an actor, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
The Israeli hardliners, however, let the opposite conclusion.
Militarily speaking, Hamas is no longer dangerous.
The Israeli anti-missile system, "iron dome" can prove its worth and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
Israel will not be able to sleep more easily for at least a while.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remain firm in its position, many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel, have fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed 30 Israelis, since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the non-proliferation of the plants in the West Bank and that into the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. To protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared illegal, however, continue to be developed.
Netanyahu is good. his Likud party in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, Avigdor Lieberman has allied with a more combative group.
Why this nanny behind wily Palestinians and leave them in a state of their own?
If you really have the control over the West Bank, would you then do not exactly as their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip, firing missiles?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and to punish them if they dare to raise the heads.
It may be that the hardliners prevail, but the Arab spring could make you a line by the court.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local super power the new Arab governments will hardly help repair their economy.
that the pragmatic president Mursi with Barack Obama, together, in order to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign-and perhaps represent the beginning of a new era.
The Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination, a powder keg, which no doubt one day will explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, as well as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
the repression now is undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
bloody missions for the eradication of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be increasing its diplomatic toll over the years.
both sides need a boost from foreign
the right answer is those by the representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and more will be represented by this newspaper: two states where Israel for security purposes, areas with its tail between its legs.
The small-- for the near future hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.
together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt must now stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and to convince a shared Jerusalem.
outsiders, Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
that would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also play its part to induce Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
far away in the White House, it seems as if he is as a participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
and it includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
