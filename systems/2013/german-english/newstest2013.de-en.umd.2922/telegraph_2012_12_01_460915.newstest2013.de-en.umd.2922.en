Petronella Wyatt: I was from Oxford Gemobbt because I am a Tory
not only attacked university students today for their views
It has always been my biggest dream, to be given a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university I once considered to be the largest know Temple in the world, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilisation-- free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester college in the late 1980s, where I had intended to study history-I had my suitcase again and so the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
my friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said it, I would, because I had a problem with that fellow students in a neighbouring room had sex.
The author of a n Wilson said mischievously, I would leave the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I went away.
Yes, well, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
not because of my unusual name, or because I was from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only-a reason in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment to narrow and now seemed cruel: my late father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I have been an advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students suffering the moderate right under similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has developed such dimensions that called for a group of them last week, the same equal rights protection to the benefit of gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
conservative members of the junior common room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi college, you will be isolated because of their political views "often actively, personally attacked and" declared undesirable.
They call for a place in the Equality Committee of their college, to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
The situation was aggravated by a recent documentary on political students screened on BBC two, "wonderland: young, bright and on the right," the Tories as Eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been shown, among other things, a graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative Association of Oxford University, in a Rolls-Royce and Silberfarbenem Protzte suit and silver occupied or stock.
other universities say conservative students, they are seen as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke black, vice-president of the conservative students Association of the University of Nottingham, was left in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing trend in universities.
The people believe we are as the Bullingdon Club, without us even to have got ".
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable." the 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-designate of the conservative student association of Oxford says they have JRC Members observed a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members', she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford I was such a minority.
As I was unbelievably timid 18-year-old arrived in September 1986.
hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted in favour of Margaret Thatcher-a former student-because of cuts in higher education to give no official title.
the atmosphere had even Stalinists squirm.
in the first days of the first-week semester in the new students and Tutoren acquaintance, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the students not only Duldeten Tutoren the mockery of Tory, but even attended it.
political issues such as the miners' strike, privatization and the rejection of the sanctions against the apartheid government of South Africa found their way into the HolzgetäFelten spaces of the Tutoriums.
The first of these events should I French texts translated into English from the 18th century to what then should have been taken, I was not.
"Miss Wyatt", translated as "the tutor said Harry Pitt (died) now," the first paragraph, please.
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face as creation from cake, and quite unpleasant.
"Thatcher-supporters refuse to learn French, or are they simply stupid?" he asked me.
The other students Kicherten.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few French in their leisure time hours-in other words, if they are not too preoccupied with their social activities' Knurrte Pitt.
I returned with HäNgendem head in my room.
This evening I sat alone at the dinner in college, when I Tippte someone easy on the back.
It was an English student from the second year on behalf of James, a member of the conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Everyone suspected, Tory to be harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first semester, a supporter of the Labour Party.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to forget.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs Thatcher was in all respects.
This ploy should prove unsuccessful.
A first in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, visited the Eton College as a conservative, said to me: 'You are the daughter of a fascist pig. "
you are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and bad way.
"As the Tories have sex? 'asked me.
the other?
I felt so how homosexuals have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States.
I would ever be able to Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would like-minded can make only after the collapse of the darkness?
I should like to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural instincts?
The three years before me were gradually, my intellectual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, to recognise the open as Tory, it was Norman stone, a professor of contemporary history, had its headquarters in my college.
Not only was he hated to be a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of external policy, and wrote speeches for them.
He was only rarely.
He hated the place it was insular and narrow and rejected him for his Marxist-Deterministische historical perspective.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy," he said.
I began to commute between Oxford and the House my parents and took refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the Vierzigern all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
This is not something they would never do, in my city of TräUmenden Tower alarm.
Even my communist friends always impeccable manners.
his wet eyes marred.
then the whole a chance.
I am sure Neckt you.
It would break my heart if you gingst.
exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance was weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and abdicated his convictions.
During a Tutoriums seriously in the following week, another history tutor had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly Zerging in shame, I was that my parents had undergone a "brainwashing" and called them "old dunce."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, which is the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford-career.
At that time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
my door was closed.
I hid me in my room, and after five minutes gave my persecutors.
as they walked, Packte I a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
like you can a Weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But 18-year-olds should ever in any educational institution suffer such intimidation and spite.
and it is even more tragic is that it was Oxford-a university, not only had 14 Tory Prime Minister, but up to now hiding behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
