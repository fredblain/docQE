The most difficult job in the world: the human work animals from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the makers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they are 70 kilogram of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work hell is literally in hell, and other work.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, a mine of the 400 workers who earn their living by sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He has every day down to the land of his Kraters, where the gushing from the earth from decimating sulphur tablets containing gas in contact with the air.
After he has extracted large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, transported it in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths of stone.
there are only 250 metres until the top of the volcano, which is in a height of 2386 metres but the exhausted makers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in tortoise pace, and they must keep the balance and their steps carefully, so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, such as this one French Touristin happened, years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted.
mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which reduce them.
Yet, tracks the path between the tourists, they are like circus monkeys photography and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company has set up a little further down to a height of 1850 metres
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi never better, since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and (said) exploiting its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulphur.
They then sold for the 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and for the manufacture of matches next, fireworks, cosmetics, particular and even used the bleaching of the sugar.
"Since we normally 70 kg for every way we receive around EUR 46.000 rupees (3.8)," says US Anto in the normal case three routes on the day.
for every line he needs three hours that he is completely managed, at the end of the day, but he then 138.000 rupees (11.5 million).
what looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is the three of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest will be paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income EUR two million rupees (167), is very high," explained the source of previously worked as a builder on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned EUR 75,000 rupees (6.2) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family in Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have them to Java to them to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing fit often irritate and his eyes are the result of toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto is for three years living on the Kawah Ijen is at stake, the sulphur in the first mark, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs and his eyes are often irritate because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I am here for another two years because I make a shop or would like to learn Spanish or French," he promises, in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but life Gestrafte young man could work as tourist guides, waiters or the reception of the hotel, but instead he carried out the work of trag Els.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other agencies and at two O'Clock every morning because of sulphur is also applying its distinctive yellow paint in the darkness at night conspicuous BläUlich.
The shadow face challenging, it is in the light of a small lamp on his helmet, he has bought his own money, the Krater.
About 400 winner on Krater, laden with sulphur soil the baskets on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company, in order to save costs, and provides the sulphur reduction not mechanised the makers working on their own account and paid according to weight, no equipment.
They also get a share of the EUR 30,000 rupees (2.5) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this nature parks, together with the entrance fee to the tune of EUR 15,000 rupees (1.2) of the tourists, the photographs of the volcano and the human sel.
"This work is for the animals and not the people," protested Madrusin, a StäMmiger, 42-year-old winner of three decades since leaving school on the Kawah Ijen is working.
He is in a position to take up to 110 kg and assured that it continues, "as long as it is", because the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my life.
Even if the sulphur the throat burning eyes and touch when the wind suddenly and the mine workers in the thick pillars sticking, graduating from the Krater, the men are so tough that nobody complains about serious diseases... of course, apart from the normal breathing problems, Arthrose, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, the weight of the baskets have distorted.
The basket on his back, Unainik only in the situation, with its 53 years to 50 kg.
Every day, he and his associates 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, the three trucks on a goat path between the GebüSch transported to camps in Taman Sari in 18 kilometres away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my life," said Unainik, he opens his mouth wide in the absence of some teeth.
of his five children, the oldest is working with his 30 years as sulphur-makers.
As time passes, but the meagreness, generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world: the human burden those donkey on the Kawah Ijen work.
