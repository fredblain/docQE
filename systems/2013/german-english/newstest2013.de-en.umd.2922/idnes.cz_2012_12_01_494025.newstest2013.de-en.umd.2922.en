Poland and the space.
Poland was last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA as twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member state from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994 with a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects.
But the way the space in Poland began much earlier.
before the Second World War workers Polish Cosmos fans with the space, and they are not always understanding.
I refer for example to the presentation of A. šTernfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, the idea of the author from his pioneering work 'entrance to Kosmonautik'.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905), the audience to users, but cold and after years reminded šTernfeld that only Dr Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In the year 1934 šTernfeld won for "entrance to Kosmonautik" by Robert Esnault-Prix reps-donated Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Hirsch.
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was later an important supporter of the astronomy and space.
He wrote hundreds of articles and several books published in Polish newspapers to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis recognised worldwide contribution to the development of space, inter alia, that the Krater Erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
already in the year 1925 a rail Draisine was built in Poland, was planned for the missile propulsion.
Unfortunately, the author of the text and the details of this project, remained unknown.
it is not even clear whether the missile should be used to start or stop the Draisine.
The information come solely from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry started to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research led Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke KomóRka tech Niki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with the Institute and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the traditional documents that the research into the stage of practical tests was reached.
But the research was then suspended by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, appeared in the press of the draft a photo from ing. RohozińSki electric rocket, and in the following year, the hunting "raki ETA Torpeda Powietrzna I Rakietobomba Lotnicza 'the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
On the eve of the war, all the projects on the military use of missile technology from temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-coordinated Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of work was completed its work, however, by the beginning of the war.
Another appeared to space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (polskie Towarzystwo Astro Nautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society in the November edition of the magazine problemy in 1954 in the four major articles of the space.
The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal of establishing a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects for satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space future would have.
already in its inception in 1956, the Polish space society PTA to accede to the 1951-based International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA was already 1956 due in the autumn.
The following year, was the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.
In this post he had held until his death in 1959.
since 1956, the PTA in the forefront of the development of the very successful meteorological rocket (raki ETA Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start was on 10 October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built in 1959 and began in the BłęDóW desert flight tests of the two-stage missile RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed around 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work-RM-34 rocket should reach a height of up to 14.5 km and for the monitoring of high winds.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
RM, the successor to the first missiles of the type Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length of fraud 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
This missile were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), from differences in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport area with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 per litre and Meteor-1C 0,62 litres.
The maximum height in all three types of fraud 37 km.
In the years 1965-1968 was in the aviation institute developed the meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was in a position to make a useful weight of 10 kg in an amount of approximately 60 km.
then the versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also worth noting the accession of Poland to the cospar (Committee for space research) in 1960, and two years later was followed by the creation of a national COS par-Committee.
Poland also participated in the context of the cosmos-programme with Soviet satellites in space research, and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski, after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second international kosmonaut.
