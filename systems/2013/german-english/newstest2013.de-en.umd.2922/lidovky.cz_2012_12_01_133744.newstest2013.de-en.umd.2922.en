The film Argo: if it's the worst Hollywood call
In November 1979 demonstrate a mob of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
for their release, they were asking for the extradition of the deposed shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime.
There was no positive outcome from this situation for the American government, they could not afford, to throw out the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to retrieve made things even worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The director and actor Ben Affleck's Argo film describes an episode of this history, gave the United States a small part of the victory.
immediately before the occupation of the embassy managed six embassy staff fled.
This came after numerous complications in the residence of Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; helping them a flamboyant story on the cover of their true identity-they travelled with Canadian passports allegedly turn in the country disguised as members of a film at the places visited for a science-fiction movie.
The combination of genres
The plan developed by experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also made the necessary cooperation of Hollywood.
The cover was credible, article published in journals, conferences have been held on this film project and the fictitious production society had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a particular combination of film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called 'caper movie "-- the story of a successful Husaren piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the documentary film the mood levels, on the one side (in the title sequence Ikonische contemporary photographs showed scenes from Tehran, and in the film version of the same situations, there are no great differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and easily taken.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions-men in suits at the meeting table, in the official Gallery, on the phone...
Ben Affleck, this film is a remarkable revival of his career.
A Bel√§Chelten actor has become a respectable Director, as well as actors, it is now no longer the target of ironic comments.
argo is his third game film for the thriller not easy (gone baby gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time it is Afflecks first film not in the local Boston director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood contrasted with the more general.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have taken place-the first sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity and feeling yet Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability that comes when moving somewhere the history.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff in a bazaar in Tehran).
too much action in too many places
The director also had to face up to the fact that history really does not offer many exciting scenes in cinema sense.
with the few working but quite successfully, it helps sometimes, the reality-was not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the impending crisis is averted by a telephone call at the airport in Tehran in America, or the persecution of hunting on the runway, something curious).
The weakness of Argo is too broad distribution, which is determined by the need to act too much in too many places to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in their roles as Hollywood workers are very charming, but their characters could have more space and they are not alone in the film by far.
Afflecks film that loses traction. It is a film, with some interest and the design and the retro-style, reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years Goutieren.
He inspires enthusiasm, however difficult.
Today, in some way as a reminder of a living piece of history and, as proof, such as excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services, but it is enough.
