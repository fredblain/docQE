Singapore needs babies to rescue the economy.
The Singapurer shift the blame that on the career, the stress they have no children, and the cost of real estate and the upbringing of children.
"The population of Singapore has to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our duty to the people, and we live!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minz candy, but-or just because they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a Viralen video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a Rapper-Song, the local sayings such as "pushing a" Bao "(loaf) in the kiln, in order to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency Bbh, which preserves the video films, the hope that the advert in combative way, to draw attention to the problem.
its creative director, Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of the music, the people to meet its "national duty."
This is something for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The breed, we are the worst in the world, therefore, we observed that it is a subject that we had to take care of us.
We knew that the government had tried many things, as for example the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of speed-dating-evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success.
We thought: why do we not do something as creatively as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap Komponieren?
1.2 children
If this is not an easy issue, the Government of Singapore.
Each year, 1 300 US dollars for political measures, in order to encourage the citizens to have more children.
A package of the government granted to married couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, highly technological city-state in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the rate of fraud-which is also known as the replacement rate-was in 1976.
So why not more Singapurer children?
the national population office Tan Wei Ming, Director for marriage and family policy, says that this "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has allowed the people, except to marry and form a family to have far more options in terms of life goals and priorities," says.
These changes in the social conditions to have contributed to the higher number of single and delay on the marriage and birth, which is a result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy which led to a surge in immigration, counter to the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where hardly any covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who criticised that they keep wages low and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the government party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made, to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the impact on the economic growth of the nation, the tax revenue, the cost of health care and immigration policy, the example shows Singapore has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve, that not so many small homes to be built.
So it has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and must be built in certain areas of the city.
these apartments have a residential area of 46 square meters and show a huge sales success.
The concern, though, is that they can promote the lifestyle of single, and that they deter firms from great to build housing for families.
But Lim Yew soon, director-general of the real estate company El developers, says that his "sell" much faster than shoe boxes more housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are long days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
The result of this is that they are much better for our cash flow.
He is, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously placed obstacles in the way, if you want to build many small housing units in a project.
too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singapore pieces, from working in the financial quarter, that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, so many will be delayed," says a young managers.
Children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own time and money," says another, roughly 20 years old man.
men and women, their careers, the stress and the costs for the property and education as reasons that they cannot have children.
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to children, because the Government can still do so much.
