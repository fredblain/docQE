HéCtor "Hetin Reyes:" Basketball was my life '
the worlds truant basketballs, HéCtor "Hetin Reyes was the basket sport longer than 60 years and has traveled to the whole world.
few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of the country such as basketballs HéCtor "Hetin Reyes.
Before he was wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes 6 years was part of the sport, as a player of lower classes, players in the first national league, agent and head of the BSN with the vaqueros de BayamóN or president of the Basketball Association.
"I have spent my life in basketball many hats on, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and President of the Association was in the 1990s," recalled Reyes in a visit by Primera hora in his own home in BayamóN, where he entrusted with Isabel, his wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all Dekoriert and they show with photographs and memories of his long career.
BayamóN heart
The most emotional memories are those in his time in the vaqueros of the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated with his 15-year anniversary as Chief Executive Officer and Director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships since 1967 of the vaqueros as directors, managers or coaches.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
and then I with a championship in 1981, the year of DebüTs of Jerome MINCY BSN.
From then took "cuco" Ortiz, was a very good manager, "says Reyes.
I know that gene Bartow, worked here as a coach, and the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players.
MöChtest you it? "
and that was the beginning of MINCY, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
then the free performance specialists Raymond Gausse, bartow recommended a citizens and was one of our best launchers.
Still, as he said, I know that, if a cup of bayamon, MINCY Gausse for further concerns.
The championship was the vaqueros with Gausse granted him, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the Association in 1988.
This time, he drew his application and MINCY to enjoy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we should have been the fourth documented what bronze would have been, if not this Canadian referee, we repeated the last Spielzug for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won in the Olympic Games in 2004 against the dream team.
But my favorite is the team at the Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold in 1991 and the team the United States offered a fight, as when they won bronze at the World Cup against us.
When the team were not only MINCY Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico LóPez and "PiculíN (Ortiz) (Javier) again, but also the young players' ToñIto 'ColóN and James Carter, LeóN (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario Brothers' Quixote 'morales, the 1990 could not be due to a knee injury.
The team, which was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but won a gold medal and the US with great pleasure, those of the Olympic tournament was NeuquéN, Argentina in 1995.
with players such as "Canito" nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blockage of players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we oppose any forecast won the gold medal.
who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was, without doubt, PiculíN Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as PiculíN.
and this is without taking account of his career in the various leagues, in which he has played.
who was the best coach for Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We had a number of good coach Julio Toro, Flor MeléNdez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armand Ito Torres.
The young, I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What Glaubst you is the best of what you have achieved in the Association?
I was part of the most successful era of the BSN team from 1988 to 1995, the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
what you have to do?
There are things I would have imposed, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The boys play in Ponce, for example, only in their area and only the National playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, many make the children unnecessary travel and games.
At least, I see the outcome of the required training and courses for coaches, officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you do today?
I listen to music, see music videos from YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and my time and I can go to a basketball game.
and, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
