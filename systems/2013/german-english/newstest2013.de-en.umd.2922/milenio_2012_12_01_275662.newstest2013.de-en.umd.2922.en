The cause of a dying because AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bombshell," he says of the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success "tried to weaken."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to look just about his illness and began to inform; and that with such use, that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the hospital civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fight in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, avoiding even the director of a clinic of the Imss to adopt "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, there are still many people in the hospital, unaware of their disease and where the virus has already been damage, your immune system has outlived its usefulness, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
Thirty years after the incidence of AIDS in the world, in other words after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of patients, the treatment time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information was backed by a prominent scientific publication in April this year.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life of the extent of the damage to the immune system attached to the people at the start of treatment, and that those who have greater opportunities, which are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above remarks mean that anyone who gets diagnosed HIV-positive in the 25 years of age "can easily be 75 years old, in this sense, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality has decreased significantly in the last few years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, 6.678 cases in 2007 to reduce the Onusida 4.862 in 2011 (annual report)), it is nevertheless true that since the AIDS died 60% of patients covered in the national database.
In Jalisco, in 2011 255 people died alone, and until the month of May this year, there are 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
So people still die-why?
In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any problems with the drugs, the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their infectious State, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have a lifelong infection. Earlier diagnoses are needed in order to influence the global mortality, why all the people where this is necessary, must be offered screening massively."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the consejo estatal de PrevencióN del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio, carry out the test at a private laboratory, and the only reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS-phase and even had the Kaposi Sarkom (a cancer tumor), which is the usual complications.
everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we want to hear.
"If I die, then three times burst," says in my case.
The amendment was to improve, I ErnäHre me well, sport and take note of the medicines.
We now know his parents that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I am standing much, have an active, but responsible sex life, I respect on my health and that of the other person," one Fabrizio, the agreed to his intimate details with Milenio Jalisco to share, with his testimony to encourage those who are today within the framework of the World AIDS Day.
You should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live as all the people responsible.
his message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
condoms behind the counter
There are large holes between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has adopted the cause of HIV.
and the most important thing is prevention.
The increases in certain places, "the distribution of condoms actually was; previously they were individually, now give us packages to hundreds of piece, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The high-risk individuals for new infections among young people.
"What need you?" is a question of widespread ridicule of social workers, staff orientation in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to expose, assured the correspondent.
He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in issuing equipment in public toilets facilities, often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
It should not be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question on whether under its management would be distributed condoms.
"sexuality is not; it is best, the condoms to bring it closer to those who already have a sexual activity", brought it to the point.
key data of Jalisco
There are cases 13.435 accumulated (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
the state National seen in 4 new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13 in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection cases on sex, 6% of the blood and peri-natal 2%.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are people who are registered for each case of 4 or 5, do not know.
