The word "lack of human rights" in the constitution.
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
the future constitution with Sharia law as the basis is controversial.
The Egyptian President segment with emotion.
We must create the transition.
"and that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.
They have all been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
fear of a theocracy on the Nile of grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said Mohammed Mursi almost Entschuldigend, limit the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily and expanded its powers, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year-old engineer, a PhD of the American University of Southern California, really want to save, the Egyptians, the world is not entirely in the clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
In fact, the 234 articles, as in the 100-member of the Islamist-dominated constituent assembly pushed through a night, 15-hour Parforce ride, some were worrying.
As in previous constitutions also stated in the draft law reasons on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation and it is to be feared that the vague wording and the associated legal room for the Islamists will use a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
that suggests at least a new managed Article: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al-ashar University on this point, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great power in the entire Sunni Islam.
This must not, however, it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which would lead to the de facto disenfranchisement of the Judiciary.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
problematic: the civil military jurisdiction should also continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator were up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morals and values."
This is legally vague terms that even state institutions, with the help of this article could control the content of film art and literature.
in plain language, this means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, no article stipulates expressly the equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy to insult or to slander.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
also questionable is the wording to "insult to the people" is banned.
There has been a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a leader?
interpretation, as much in the draft to sign, Mursi and his words will be presented "very soon" the Egyptians on the referendum.
"The revolution is Back '
The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unaccustomed harmony in Tahrir square in Cairo on Friday night and promised to bring the charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi Drittplatzierter of presidential elections.
The Nobel peace prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said, the draft constitution "on the scrapheap of history."
He accused the supporters Mursis via text messaging service twitter, a "coup against democracy".
"If the referendum, we will go to his palace and pounce," the opposition said Jasser said.
"We are still not tired of the blood of our brothers is still not arrested," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
and several judges announced that the referendum would not want to monitor, which will become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood inflated to counter demonstration, as a precaution after a mass prayer, but not in Tahrir Square, but on the other Nile Bank of Cairo University.
Many of the veiled women and supporters of the Salafists attended and chanted: "the people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded Mursi, "SäUbere!" and made the country: "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have led to civil war conditions.
The Mursis supporters obviously did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people to decide through the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists is safe.
"Human rights is not even the word '
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, until February and involve all social forces have gone.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
not because he would share their beliefs, but because human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"and now is not the word 'human rights in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world" on Sunday.
Mursi power extension to all three branches in the state's lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"rather than to strengthen civil society, the president they de facto no force," laments Saeda.
But without civil society organisations could not function a democracy.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community to fight the ideological direction of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could backfire.
a protestor in the Tahrir warns: "Your GebäHrt a monster, you can no longer control."
