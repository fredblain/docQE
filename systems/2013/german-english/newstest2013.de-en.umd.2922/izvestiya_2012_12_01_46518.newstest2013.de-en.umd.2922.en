"The brain is so far only moderately on lists'
supporters of modern technology purveyors of the recently enlarged reality will usually seen through the lens of a special glasses.
first Google at its annual conference in the summer presented a working model in November was then aware that Microsoft had filed for a patent.
In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
It fascinates the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands and to create virtual free land.
- you briefly describe what research group.
We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to expand the borders of this interaction.
So far, the largely stuck in the phase in which mankind with Pixeln worked on flat screens, sometimes will also be affected.
But we want to look ahead of 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors sold a progress, and these days, no more Xbox Kinect, as all for widespread interest.
what awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction on a physical level, plays a great deal still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the spending has not yet decisive.
We are trying to change, work on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We need the computer world in our physical world and make it comprehensible.
It is, however, essential that not only the users, but also its surroundings.
then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
First and foremost we should Bescheuerten virtual-reality helmets Los!
- what do you think about management?
It is popular, but it is not overvalued?
- it is certainly not the end solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because not all would like to inform others about his actions and intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with computers, but each in their specific niche.
For example, we were in the field of the management of objects on a project in which we in public places with short and narrow, with Ausladenden gestures-face.
The gestures were not the object of a bracelet, which recorded the movements of the camera, but registered bone and muscle.
Still, it is relatively large, but could in theory be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, on the whole, however, the future joint management types, for example Gestik and language.
- How?
We would ask me, for example, this Sprudel Tin you rich?
They say it and, at the same time.
normally i say it simply.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- this means they want the users adapt to the what can make a machine at the time and what is not?
Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
In the next time, I think that we must be especially to work on the development of new types of sensor, which enable more reactions from people.
This can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good break in the deep, which is very important.
The demands on the basis of their work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
There is a lack of dissolution, deep or something else?
The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
of course, 8 megapixel with a speed of 1000 FPS is not bad.
But the main thing is not the mega pixel itself, but the quality and the depth of the Matrix.
All current technologies are seen as not good enough for us, as the designer of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only along the dissolution of the X-, Y-, but also along the Z-axis will be taken into account.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 FPS, especially for gestures to little.
Stephen Betishes contact in our laboratory in Redmond developed a sensor with a Regulierbaren processing delay between 1 to 100 milli-seconds, with today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine.
I needed for my work as a device, only without contact management and with more images per second.
- the number of cameras should not be increased?
Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", with one of them, in fact, an infrared channels and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
and the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-camera.
It is not intended to calculate the object deep.
More cameras may solve the problem...
or increase the problem, since more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with various camera orientation, to see how the in three-dimensional identifying a position helps us.
Microsoft presented-if I remember rightly, in contrast to Google's glasses were not to the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens has the best prospects?
- of course it is not pleasant, travelling to keep a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: Tollste variant would be a "rotating" enhanced reality, we have a cloud of the glasses on the smart next May.
the lens is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private only you can see), but also its weakness, because a larger reality by means of glasses, that they can work together with other virtual objects.
Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of the virtual Hologramme in the air not only Tony stark is accessible from iron, but also human beings.
This idea, there is a problem, the critics often say: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers to their group at this point?
- in my lectures, I often talk that the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I believe the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of Taktilen perception.
An interesting method is the use of a second hand rather unusual projection document.
It takes pressure very true!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at "images in the air" something concrete, for example, the collision of some targeted ultrasound radiation in a certain point where the finger, but a feeling at the moment is still so fragile, as Pustete somebody on the hand ball.
There are also bands for the Commission on the nerve endings detect in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
We think that it is, what it should feel if it sees something?
- it is a good idea, so we have not tried.
Here lies another task, we will still have to fight for a long time, namely a person is physically in a closed space, to believe he was instead in an open, virtually infinite space here; we are working on concepts with course bands (other than in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large bullets.
So far, the brain only moderately on lists, and we still have many busy years.
that makes the work so attractive for researchers in the field of virtual reality: on many issues, we are only at the beginning.
