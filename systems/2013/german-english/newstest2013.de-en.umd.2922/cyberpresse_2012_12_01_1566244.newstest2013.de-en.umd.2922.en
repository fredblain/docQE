The Higgs-Boson analysed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Bosons has a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, we believe that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
and it is the last particle whose existence of the standard model, our best or 'least wrong' explanation of nature and behaviour of the matter, predicted, but has not yet been observed empirically.
for physicists, however, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the standard model Higgs-Boson much resembles.
In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data this week have been presented at a major physics Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data in order to be completely safe.
But we assume that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently there is only a low risk to deceive, and we look at what it is.
In this world, there is a crucial law, which means that two objects cannot be at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule-and try not to, because they will hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for such a law, they also applies: the Pauli exclusion principle established, the states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" and the "State" by and large, consists of some of its properties.
On this basis, the physicists share the particles in two categories.
In one corner are good citizens, are referred to as the Fermi one and just obey the principle of Pauli.
and in the other the Bosonen, a nasty bunch of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, in any case, not this principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same place at the same time.
These Bosonen links, according to the website the particle adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen, we will not deal with, and "force particles", by which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs-Boson somehow would be used.
Here, it must be emphasised, however, that not all these Bosonen exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this story, then it is only thanks to a Bosons by exceptional banality: the Photon, or "light particles, the" messenger "of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electrical load will be speeded up or change the direction, "disrupted" the electromagnetic field in this place, as a pebble in a pond was thrown out.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the Bosonen "sources of power."
more stable field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that a different field, "disrupted" the Higgs field, must be, so that this Boson.
But the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus needs to achieve a very high energies, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rock Zerfurcht.
A huge particle accelerator as CERN is therefore needed-the large hadron collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km, in order to achieve such energy.
Once again, the analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, a piece of paper would never think of themselves on the fridge.
and equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the other (as is the photon) do not have mass.
for what all this research can now "be good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
for the Science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists all deviations between the observations and to look closely at the predictions of the SM.
There are, in fact, many physicists eagerly hope that such derogations to be found, as the slightest difference open a door to a "new physics" and could fill some of the holes in the model.
We must say that the latter is still major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (UPS) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, the CERN such derogations which, until now, has not been found.
impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
In fact, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first permanent line were the first laser (Gepulst)-said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a "gimmick" laboratory.
imagine...
In addition, applications can also surrounded from all the instruments, the research.
Willard Boyle again during his work in the optics in 1969, for example, has developed a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor all digital cameras in the world today serves as "an eye and has brought him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the Lhc will change our lives, but it means that you really never know...
