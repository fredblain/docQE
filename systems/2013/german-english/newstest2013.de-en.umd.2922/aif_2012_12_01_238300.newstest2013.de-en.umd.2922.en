"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While members and human rights activists to discuss the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminal act already with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
their only aim is to remaining families to earn money for the maintenance of the home.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which any working immigrant must take a test, the knowledge of the Russian language,.
So far, this Regulation applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, the local housing and retail.
However, should the tests with the time, according to the Federal Migration authority for all migrant workers on duty in the future.
We must not only in Russian history and language tests, but also tests the foundations of the legislation.
language, both for the preservation, as well as the extension of the work permit.
The only exceptions apply to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
People are also excluded from the scope of this law, the training certificates and diplomas received before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
The point, the problem and the protection of rights
The examination will be under the aegis of the Pushkin-Institute for the Russian language, the Russian People's Friendship University, Moscow State University, of the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian high schools.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; similar centres in Russia more than 160 have already been opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
However, human rights activists said several times before the entry into force of the law in the press the following question: What does the whole?
The legislation, to produce what changes, both for the Russians and for guest workers?
In particular, say the migration authority spokesman, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
their rights must be protected but before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment will be 90% foreign workers to solve the problems.
encounter problems immigrants without work, education, language skills and medical observation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably meet people with evil intentions, which, under the pretext of aid it in a dark, close cabin, where he stay with dozens of his same months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day toil.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home will have a promised and, upon arrival, they cheated, confiscated their passports and do not receive the promised pay ', the head of the main administration for migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
not shout, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia not only want their money, that they do not speak the language of the country of destination, but also can hardly express in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is your fault, not so much as the evil: only a few of the Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only a sound basic education.
because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them a decent clothing, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager, these children will be the first opportunity to earn money immediately.
"It is difficult without language," they give.
"You FÃ¼Hlst humiliated and degraded."
Human rights activists say the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
They do not have this status, so there is no test and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
'warm welcome' or 'entry prohibited for unauthorised'
many migrants to confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason, of course, bureaucratic hurdles and the linguistic difficulties.
it also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
Most of the staff of the Russian police know that our documents forged and we are not registered, and it then cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"just to spare no expense for false papers'
On the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants may be falsified.
some counterfeit certificates, the completion of the language tests certify by staff of the Federal Migration Service have been hijacked.
The fraudulent documents were printed with a normal color printer.
of course, the new owners have received this not for nothing: every migrant, hoped to spare as the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost for the official test: This costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, it cannot simply be bought the certificates, both officials and human rights activists agree.
For the moment, the public authorities can guest workers who fall through the test for the first time, that it is time for a language course.
In addition, the new arrivals will be offered without knowledge in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
