"They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years," he said half-hearted in his bed in the home for palliative care, Victor-Gadbois in beloeil, in which he reached the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock to one cannot be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from, only to go to the toilet and even to eat.
table a delicious lunch, do help he resigned, to eat.
He even manages to smile bravely and to speak with strangers, which employs around him, his medicines, and offer him a bath.
the courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea heals, since this is humiliating," he shares.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man in Pinkelt ', told Pierre Victor-Gadbois Brodeur, a psychologist in homes.
In return the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"It depends on the person's ability" to take a step backwards, he notes.
According to several people who work in the palliative care, big events in the midst of this backward steps take place.
The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-trained Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses to look after them, no longer with so-called "curative care."
For example, 89 years, the worst fear, "aware and dying of suffocation".
But I really got to know my children from the disease.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more hope in life," she says, before they accepted that a mask on, helps her breathe.
They are expected in the next few days still a last visit their son, comes from Italy.
homes Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of voluntary body care and assistance in the food.
The palliative care will be used if there are no other options.
to make the die comfortable.
In Quebec, a bed on state residents for palliative care.
This is very little, if one takes into account that one day we will all die.
continued here will live under the best possible conditions, said Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the homes.
both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
it granted the dying wish of a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi.
the diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
and death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we have X a beer is served, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son from drinking the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," reported care Director Nathalie Savard.
homes Victor Gadbois is no day-as the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, the last family meeting in court and well supported by his pillow, while its official opening, a young man dies of his parents, his wife of 36 years, which is surrounded and his two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive.
"for six months, three to five beds are always subject to cancer patients in less than 45 years of age", Dr Christiane shares Martel worries.
53% of the home Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their residential site, 47% come from the hospital.
problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, in other words a care to alleviate the suffering of patients if they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
and several organisations, such as the victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
This is the great flaw in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors rule for the adoption of a law on euthanasia and Assistiertem suicide with concerns.
For the month of October is a manifesto in the circulation of prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe signed in order to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not strong enough to ensure that all have the right to a high-quality palliative care before it is accepted, move on to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room without that it has taken measures to alleviate.
I am afraid that the only reason why the patients want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
At the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions stubbornly until the last day.
The chances of survival of HéLèNe Richard were already minimal when it broke off a difficult chemotherapy.
As I Onko login has been told that I will stop the treatment, they replied that they regret that I told the fight, please.
However, she had told me that I was in the end.
No Omni strong care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients, who have asked to die, to thank the staff, that it has not granted this wish, after their pain was eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be made clear that the palliative care of the pain treatment is not omnipotent.
Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care society the domestic palliative care to the greater MONTREAL 8% of patients not on the treatment of pain.
at the very end of life so the doctors often resort to the Terminale Sedierung, which amounts to the patients either sporadic or permanently by the time of his death EinzuschläFern.
We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering.
patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity on this Terminale Sedierung.
patients whose pain is not be relieved, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean 'I want that me neutered, "but" I would like that my pain. "
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.
