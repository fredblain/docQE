Born in outer space
planet in peril.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
guiding caravans of spacecraft with earth people on board are on the search for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, is the important issue of how we in the zero gravity or the spare planet breed?
Many of the choice, in my opinion, there is not.
In fact, there are only two real planet, we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff of the astronomical Institute Sternberg-Vladimir sur Din.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in other words, all possible.
The issue of reproduction in all, the researchers first of all, in relation to the flora.
A half-century before being carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the in-orbit peas difference is not in the slightest by the Irdischen species.
The breeding of insects, followed by tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, Wachtel eggs were sent into space to study the effects of zero gravity on the development of embryos.
It is a normal chicks.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicks must stop; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explained the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew.
without firm underground Korean wild chicks.
ten hours later, Stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to the light and loud.
You then simply died four days later.
"twice we slip chicks and were all then, simply because it is impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychew failed experiment with the chicks in all.
The last breeding cages of animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, the bio-satellite "Bion" only same-sex species.
It was an experiment, which already fertilized with rats have been sent into space.
In principle, it was nothing special.
"that was with the satellite, but once again, it was only a single experiment, biotechnology and research must continue," said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the space rats offspring.
The issue of reproduction directly in space could not solve so far.
The task is difficult.
animals from their natural habitat can be simply do not follow their reproduction driving.
In contrast to animals that humans could in principle.
Homo sapiens is able to think Abstraktem and can generate a similar emotional background.
from ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
But women fly for 50 years in all.
The greatest risk was Tereschkowa.
The most valuable that mankind is the female body.
Our MÃ¶We flew and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is the space flight?
After this flight, it will bring a child into the world?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after their space flight, gave the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereschkowa, a daughter.
The child's father, Andri Jan Nikolajew, was also kosmonaut.
In 1988, only the second woman in all, Svetlana Sawizkaja twice was in orbit and even work outside the space vehicle leisure, a son.
Nevertheless remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut, after long flights, in which everything went well and healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in the orbit," concludes kosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
But the mankind for new ways in the field of biotechnology, the radiation protection and generate artificial gravity.
The hydro-engineering laboratory in preparation for the centre of the cosmonaut preparation is a compulsory station during the flight.
The cosmonaut routine wins here in a state of flux for the work in open space.
The water is the zero gravity.
If adults water as pleasant, it is also a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element.
It is, as would the small Ichtyander testimony to that life on the ocean emerged out of the country.
There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months in the belly of the mother in amniotic fluid, and that it can get easier access to water.
In principle this is logical, since from the birth until the first swim just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget," says baby Swimming Teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While a newborn child the zero gravity is a much more natural state, the woman not without gravity.
In a situation of zero gravity is the Bauch- and basin muscles very quickly and that is also the capacity to extract the child.
Well, we avoid the introductory tool by birth.
The birth, for example, could also take place in a special chamber, extract for the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand the child also artificial gravity.
without requiring that they can train the organism the skeleton and muscles do not.
a newborn baby in-orbit not as an adult to training in a suit.
He is simply the absence, which is vital for his life.
"This experiment, we jointly, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled person, a completely Unangepassten will bring people to the world," says the head of the Ethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-biological problems slice, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory.
But at some point it will become reality if the people in their spacecraft to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in all.
