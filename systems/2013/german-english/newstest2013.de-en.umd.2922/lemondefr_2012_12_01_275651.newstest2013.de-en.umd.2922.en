"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, with PSG, you have taken on a new dimension.
How do you explain this progress?
it from a personal point of view, but also can be explained by the new dimension of the PSG.
great players arrived.
Every day I am on your side.
The technical staff has given me too much.
These elements spur me to improve my play every day.
and in a game, this is easier.
In football everything very quickly.
But I must stop not enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Claire Fontaine to my game time in Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are thus the competition advantage introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers are accustomed to this summer's Games very high levels.
They also know that any training unit is crucial.
This means that a player as I stand up to, and wants to give his best.
It gives me Carlo Ancelotti position much in terms of my game.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
of course.
Ancelotti instills all technicians respect.
At present, there is no comparable in the Ligue 1 person and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I had just recovered from an injury series.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of Spitzenreiters.
But we lurk in the ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: We have qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the objective of the Association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we have very good European teams say.
First of all, we want the first of our group Porto, so that we can fight the return leg of the eighth finales than home game.
Can the PSG in the short term, a major European club?
He has said the budget...
In order to be a great European club must win Paris title and make a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG the resources so that the project taking shape.
It would be a great failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really close to my heart, this title cream off.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough for the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
should normally be master with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right thing to do.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux in title fight, I believe that we have the stuff to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In the light of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you can still find something, what you accuse us, something is certainly frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not of the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game concept.
Building a team with the time.
in the Champions League we have shown strength.
If you look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons fails to qualify for the eighth final, and also has a huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed one lead you to time out with 15 points.
This would mean that our opponents and ignored the French Cup.
Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new PSG "Geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
The PSG seems completely have to be dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
so much the better, that speaks of a "Zlatan Ibrahimovic dependence".
In other words, that have strong and firing many goals.
that is why he came, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
wherever he has played, he has eyes that he is a great player and a world star.
within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
it also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, allows all other also to make progress.
How have you seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
as a disappointment.
It was very important to me to participate in this championships.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented from having some game time.
I saw things there, from which I am stronger.
Today, I am unable to achieve good games in the national team.
This was the "Bleus" my hope for my baptism.
What has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
what you think of the first few months of Didier Deschamps, head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and to the victory.
As Laurent Blanc.
But I have no comparison.
Blanc had achieved its aim, had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" after Brazil.
On 16 October in Spain is forced undecided (1: 1) a start game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used for all the others.
before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
