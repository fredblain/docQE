On Friday, the prosecutor's office has tried to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified information in American history-failed, on several occasions to complain about the allegedly suffered abuse in military detention.
In a cross-examination Mannings during a court hearing in ft. Meade, Maryland said Maj. Ashden Fein, documents to weekly visit, prison officials had made at Mannings nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request from the defence to reject the charge-manning is the hard prison time had already been punished enough-manning testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of during his tenure in Iraq of thousands of confidential documents stolen.
The material was then published on the Internet by Wikileaks.
Wikileaks has never confirmed manning as a source for the information.
At the hearing on Friday was fine with manning the forms by the officials after their meeting with manning during his detention at Quantico military prison, where he had filled from July 2010 to April 2011, increased detention had sat.
Officials said Manning wrote questions and his answers.
as Sinn Fein questioned him Friday to the forms, he was manning that the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole had assessed as "very professional".
The forms, so beautiful, contained no complaints about ill treatment, even though officials had asked manning directly on his treatment.
Manning said he had concerns expressed orally and the officials have discussed this with him and, to deal with this, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote 'no problems' (after meeting the concerns), and not necessarily meant that I said nothing," Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, manning also asked why he had not complained about his treatment, in January 2011, when he met with a committee of the suicide idea mentioned by him a few months earlier, on a form should investigate.
Manning said his intention during this meeting have insisted that his observation status for "prevention of injury" downgrading.
The military said it had him this status-a stage under the restrictive suicide risk-on his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince people that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status on the prevention of injury (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning said to his arrest and transfer to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was held for nearly two months before in July 2010 in the prison, he was transferred to the naval base Quantico in Virginia.
In Kuwait, he said, he had considered suicide and whether the heat became unconscious.
do not know, what happens with him or in the outside world, was costly.
"My world fell to camp Arafjon, together in this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, manning spent most of his days in a small cell-at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours-and without society.
We have him only a mattress and a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay on the move, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even on the ground.
He had always sleep with light, the outside his cell.
If he turned at night and see could not see his face, it was well-versed him so that he can turn back the clock.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
on Friday asked the judge manning a charge that he had made in his statement on Thursday, as he had a night of sleep naked in his cell in Quantico and naked in a morning count before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity during this census, with his blanket Umh√ºLlen.
At the hearing on Friday was manning, he was from a command of its station closed, that he can cover the ceiling, he could have been dropped, and he was, however, that no one had called him.
On Thursday, manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked in the previous night, he had previously tried to show an official, that he is no threat for themselves.
manning told the officials that he had the federal can use his underwear or flip-flops, to violate, but did not do so itself.
On this night, manning said, were his underwear, flip-flops and glasses has been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will drastically reduce his prison experiences at least take into account and his detention standards, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defence has indicated that manning stand guilty of minor offences, while other charges, which will be seen as too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, a justification of the conditions expected from the public prosecutor's office.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held according to the rules, under the highest level of security for all arrangements in Quantico Verwahrten prisoners.
The charges against manning include the promotion of the enemy, illegal publication of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
He will be found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
