Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to more hesitation is already helping men for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have sought the opinion of two doctors.
The studies conducted in the United States, many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that the likelihood of education in an observation after 12 years of metastases is between 30% and 40% higher if no screening was carried out.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years if a direct relatives, was already ill with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men Afro-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer diagnosed.
There are cancers that are aggressive and indolent.
The patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer, the possible options which prostate crabs can remain untouched if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases tend to opt for an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many of the men, where cancer has seen no treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes you a active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy determines the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who not.
Nevertheless, I therefore recommend the implementation of the tests.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not it should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for Urologie, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA tests.

prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research is the adoption of a healthy way of life is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian cancer society.
However, it is expected that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain unresolved.
for the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
encouraging data: Ten years after the elimination of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also the outbreak of disease.
It seems the risk for breast cancer, Grimmdarm- Mastdarm- to increase SpeiseröHren- BauchspeicheldrüSen- and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colorectal cancer, fairy tale" throughout the lives, he added.
The food
The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
in large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm- or rectum.
sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between cancer and vitamin supplements.
its investigations but are not conclusive.
The Canadian cancer society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While the study found by the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, showed another rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was not yet clear.
Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu, stresses how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family to speak to burden.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
