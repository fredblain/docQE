in a constantly Elektrisierten world, it is also time to be bored
Unexpectedly, this Thanksgiving I spent five hours in the airport as the plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for other airlines.
So I had enough time for me to make a few thoughts to boredom.
I do not want to lie.
half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite NervtöTend-even if books, magazines and Iphones available (and tax-free shopping, of course).
But more and more academics and child development experts boredom as something positive.
If it were up to you, it is for us, and our children-ok, sometimes to be bored.
in interesting, so that the brain is forced to trains to lose what is perhaps the creativity.
and because most of us today almost constantly on the one or other screen that benefit us the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
and no.
I will come back.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "boredom: a lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not.
"Indeed, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls Pompejis fault a Latin inscriptions on boredom, which goes back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is defined in many ways and has been discussed.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, "a satisfactory job, but not to be able to define".
Consequently, boredom, differs from apathy to the effect that the person does not want to be employed, but this.
However, in the case of the apathy that there is no rush to do something.
The key experience boredom, he says, in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad tempered and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
boredom can almost hear such as depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that US is dull, even if we just have to focus on.
In their study, "the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention" in German, for example: "the UntäTige sense: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which appeared in the journal perspectives on psychological science "in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues listening to an earlier experiment, the participants a band, a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, had nothing to do with the content. others heard it at the lower level, so it is barely perceptible hear these noises, while the third group was not.
The people who barely audible or listening to television, gave more boring than the other two groups feel they have had problems to focus, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of Neuroscience at the University of guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you have a tedious activity, "as the search for defective products to help distract a factory conveyor belt, music and not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln often interpreted as signs of boredom can fight, even by people who remain physically more.
"studies have shown that children who keep Herumhampeln, learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske.
We will all eventually boring-my delayed flight, a film, a particularly Shun dull DröHnender loudspeaker.
But some people bore more easily than others.
researchers to measure these differences, developed a scale to boredom in the 1980's vulnerability. "
on the Richter scale, statements such as' many things I have to do and are monotonously repeat "and" I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything. "
With the help of such scale, researchers have found that young is more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a fairly Abgespannter bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents by seven or eight times a day with a pager Kontaktierte.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and do the homework, while 23% claims to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents said to feel bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages are about boredom has risen or fallen.
He was sure, however, that "the youth is seen as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily lives end.
So, back to my original question: is boredom, healthy?
in the extreme, sometimes not, because it leads people into extreme physical risks to take and the gambling or drugs to alleviate it, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors analyse the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants a say, that we should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not always know just what you should do the best.
If a is dull and the energy used to be and to cook, we will be happy to play Gitarre.
But television may evaporate for good feelings to ensure this in the short term but in the long term.
So who has spent his child an Ipad is enough, it can distract you from the boredom. It has not learned to maintain itself or to control, says Professor Fenske.
and he adds: "self-regulation is a situation on the other."
The child learns not only to have more self-control, but also in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate for long time.
We should also not critical.
Instead, our aim should also at ease from the permanent AktivitäTs- and technology sprinkling.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds so than we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something useful," he says.
In fact, he believes that the people just looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we constantly be stimulated, it is difficult to deal with, once the noise has fallen silent."
