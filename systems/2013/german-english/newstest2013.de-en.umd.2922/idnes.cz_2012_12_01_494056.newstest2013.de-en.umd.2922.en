The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not the solution.
In the last week, the constitutional court the law on voluntary work.
This decision caused a lively debate in the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) when it comes to price tensions.
To understand this concept is a condition in which the manufacturers trying to import cheaper goods in economic competition, by undercutting the competition "', in order to seize a larger market share and to increase their profits.
on a large scale, this means for most companies to transfer their manufacturing abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since the private capital is not social responsibility and also bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, are necessarily the spending increase.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies will create a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This manifests itself in particular amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people, to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.
This is an economic force in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of workers.
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
for several years in Germany, there are public food distribution to the poor, which are no longer in a position to feed, through their own work.
The number of people already in the millions.
in the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly given to cases in which workers such a low salary, that the state must increase their income until the subsistence level.
such a scandal was also in the case of workers exposed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of practically all EU-Southern States will undoubtedly be in the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a disastrous crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance, on the fringes of society to languish, and I hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
This is naturally the question of where this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, moves the poverty of; or the capital remains the same from one country to another, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt and Africa at work for a fraction of the salaries of the employees.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
ad nauseam Liberal theories and the media claim that the state must not involved with capital in its own economy and that economy could lead to economic disaster.
The private, parochial, insists on its position that the state should not intervene directly in the economy.
then, however, we must ask whether the private policy and therefore the whole state influenced or even in their own selfish interests.
The clear answer is: yes.
proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all member states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of legislation, the corruption, the mutual benefit, virtually everything is criminally punishable, but nothing.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department lack of finances private, closely interdependent with the industry law firms charged with the preparation of draft legislation.
The draft law will be then passed in the Bundestag.
all the violence is no longer, as the western constitutions, but from the people of strong financial groups with their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies soon in a situation at the moment, as you APP Ian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic when Caesar and Pompeius' describes: "The state was long in the break, and the offices were filled with violence.
bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.
corruption has grown incontinent, and people with already buy votes on election "..." people with character applied for not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul "..." we already really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this serious situation was a dictatorship, and that a strong man... should be chosen "APP Ian thought although Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, based on today's society as well as in ancient times on the ruthless preference to their own advantage, without overall interests of society.
private capital is by its very nature, is not in a position to see the benefit of the whole of society.
The result, now as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, not in the slightest for deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economy, we must therefore find systems in the 19th and 20th century.
from today's situation, can be regarded as certain break the fall of this regime for the liberal democracies, already in the next round.
particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the social and humanitarian disasters, we have already witnessed, and crimes against humanity, as we know from the history of older and newer, in complete ignorance.
The lifting of the law on voluntary work here is not the solution, or at least not lasting.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the level of social security of the population.
This trend is therefore bound.
The only solution targeted political and social reforms, the capital increase the state participation in the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the Government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
