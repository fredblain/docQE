after the Court of Appeal, the United States has confirmed a verdict that the restructuring of the liabilities of the bankrupt group vitro does not recognise, on a trade in Mexico has been achieved, a sinister precedent for each national companies with offices in the neighbouring country, the payment problems.
So you could say that the procedure for the survival of the companies, the Mexican laws allow, in the land of the stars and stripes in contradiction of international agreements have no validity.
In practice, on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale at the court to ban car rotas for the Northern District of Texas, the Mexican companies are exposed to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico and opens the door to three inconsistencies the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judges issue indicates that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States says the appeal of the fifth circuit, based in New Orleans, first of all, that it is dealt with in the main proceedings of the Mexico trade bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in the procedure in the event of the insolvency of companies with trans-national profile is not known.
To this end, was indeed the model law for the unification of the international trade law, the United Nations and the American law institute was used as arbitrators.
Secondly, the judgment that, without the votes of societies for the recognition of liabilities in the liquidation of the branches of vitro with their parent company had not achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debt.
However, this option is recognised by the Mexican laws.
Indeed, vitro is not the first case in which this system has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the group by the Instituto federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for trade bankruptcies) confirmed.
It is also true that after deducting the votes of the branches of the creditors of vitro, the creditors in the courts of the United States against vitro-cases, i.e. the vulture funds, such as, for example, Aurel ios capital, Aurel ios convergencia, Elliot internacional and Liverpool have limited, no majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there are other vitro blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the serious economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country strikes.
For this reason, the Sada family GonzáLez before the same court objection to the vote in plenary, in other words by all judges voted, because only three of them.
is not met, the Cerciorare-lodged, calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious in this case is that the court a document aside, the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) was sent, what the in vitro procedures carried out within the framework of the law on trade described bankruptcies, and pointed out that it had kept to the letter of the agreement signed by the two countries, in order to comply with the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It also pointed out that the country subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which is to say, it has laid down the rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
