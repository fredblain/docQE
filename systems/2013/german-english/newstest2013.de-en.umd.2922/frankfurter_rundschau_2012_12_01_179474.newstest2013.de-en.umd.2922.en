Messenger: NASA found ice on mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is on the planet Mercury ice.
The ice cover is perhaps up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are some frozen water from three studies published Thursday in the specialist magazine "Science".
The probe messenger have found evidence that the ice is constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or Asteroids on the mercury may be taken.
But no one does the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist Sean Solomon, Messenger-probe,.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to clarify how the water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.

Our insights into space: The main Teleskope
The telescope will be Hans Lipperhey invented 1608-even before Galileo Galilei began to observe stars on it a year later.
Since then, the mirror of the optical Teleskope increasing-and the insight they provide deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, the Hale telescope at the palomar observatory near San Diego was the world's largest long-distance pipe.
The Mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
in Arizona, the United States, the large binocular telescope.
It can look into space on two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
the inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge-alone the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter.
the mirror of the southern African large telescope in southern Africa is segmented-in order to save costs.
Nevertheless it has a diameter of about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of good design: the telescope is in his corner of here-and so in limited his mobility.
The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is in view.
its characteristic: the high light collection force.
This is despite comparatively low mirror diameter, to the world's largest mirror Teleskope.
With the help of a radio telescope at arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers all aliens signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "search for extraterrestrial intelligence (Seti) anyone can help by computer owners he would available.
Look at the Observatory of European Sternwarte (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the very large telescope-worthy of its name.
with its four lights from the distance pipe can also reflect the medium-sized infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory will be the European extremely large telescope.
Its main mirror will include hefty 42 metres-and almost a thousand mirror elements.
But with images is 2018 at the earliest.
By 2007, were the two Keck-Teleskope in the Hawaiian root volcano Mauna Kea, as the largest in the world.
They offer two levels, with an average of 10 metres.
the Keck-Teleskope are part of Mauna Kea Observatory, among them with the Subaru telescope and the Irttf looking towards the sky.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope-- an average of 30 metres with a mirror.
It is an illustration to gaze at.
However, the most important impressions from the provides all the space telescope Hubble.
Since the 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler is looking for extra-solar planet-mainly in the countryside.
On 2 February 2011 was announced by NASA that identified 1235 planet candidates since the mission began.
In the picture are the last start preparations on the space telescope Kepler documented.

The space infrared telescope's primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it should seek the light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that also exists on the south pole of the Mercury ice.
However, there is no reliable data, because underpins the messenger far closer to the North Pole for the planet.
For decades, have radar measurements suggest that the Mercury ice.
By 2004, Messenger-tube-launched the first, which underpins the mercury-the scientists have now certainty.
