Szabo: "German must play greater role '
Germany, which abstained in the vote on the opening of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced Berlin on a fine diplomatic line.
German wave: the beginning of the week, Germany had first indicated that it opposed the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why not?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel must be cautious, however.
But, at the same time, I believe that it is also not supported the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This has finally been enforced by the NATO.
Germany is finding it difficult to adopt a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
This is due to the fact that surrounded his foreign policy and away from a policy was pay, so to speak, of the United States, to a German foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans find themselves between the fronts.
It is expected that a more independent role, but they are not used.
I think you buttons to their role, but they are on the path to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, like France or Britain.
What is a 'normal' foreign policy, specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness, in positions of national interests, which are independent from those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful to the public, but also the elites, not to offend in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would also not want to attach much weight to, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
In any case, but it plays an important role in German thinking.
Germany has its relations with the United States damaged by it has abstained from voting on important decisions, such as on the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
I do not think, therefore, that this was such a dramatic collapse, as in the Libyan issue.
maybe Germany will play even a certain respect.
because it signals that it must be taken into account as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests.
There are different views in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand have been clear for a veto.
There are differences between the United States and many European nations?
because the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government can not represented this position publicly, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not so great as they seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then it is Obama, not so upbeat of Netanyahu's policy.
Germany is finding it difficult, his close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
so you can not be part of a wider line and must instead things from their own position.
that they do so with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future, to press Europe to a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
I believe, however, that the German, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany to see itself in the role as an important international players-Germany wants to play a major role?
or is the lead Germany still difficult?
Germany is not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country, to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the Euro crisis, every time when Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German sentiment.
that makes it the German is not easy.
This is, in fact, the old problem: you do not be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy continues, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who remains otherwise?
The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like it is inconvenient for them and they will be much less popular, c'Est la vie.
