<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy in order to counter the re - election of President Obama</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The leaders of the Republican justify its policy with the need to combat fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the Brennan Centre, the latter is a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud in the United States is far less than the number of people killed by the -.</seg>
<seg id="4">The lawyers have the Republicans in 10 years in the USA is only 300 cases of fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One fact is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the level of participation.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, these measures are undermining the democratic system in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast with Canada are the states for the conduct of the elections in the individual States.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this sense, has announced new laws, the majority of the American governments since 2009, the more difficult the procedure for the registration or the elections.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has gained after the elections in November 2010, 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states were able to be recorded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Consequently, 180 draft laws have been introduced in the year 2011, the constraints on the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new laws are demanding that the voters present a Lichtbildausweis citizenship and a proven US-Staatsb.</seg>
<seg id="12">I also by this legislation will also reduce the time periods for the early vote declared invalid, the right to register on election day itself as voters and citizens, denied the right to vote, for which a Gerichtsakte.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the elections in 2006 has no US-Staat from the electorate to show that a Lichtbildausweis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first federal state, who has made this request.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme Court of the United States, in 2008 the constitutionality of the law by Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities are hurrying to extend it to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the course of the last two years in 34 bred legislation states with which the electorate, to show a Lichtbildausweis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, in contrast to the US citizens Quebec not on a universal cards as the health card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of US citizens have, i.e. 21 million Dutch people, not of a governmental authority of their state Lichtbildausweis issued.</seg>
<seg id="20">I also five million Neuwähler in 2012, we do not have such a card.</seg>
<seg id="21">But often to pay more than a hundred dollars, in order to receive the necessary document.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Of the new restrictions are affected disproportionately by young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, an African American have 25%, 15% of people with an income of less than 35 000 dollars, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 not have the necessary Lichtbildausweis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This goes further.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students who are regarded as voters, to cast their votes for the more democratic candidates, it is not permitted in a number of Member States, from its creation to its use Lichtbildausweis issued.</seg>
<seg id="26">Andererseits the same States allow members of fish or Jagdvereinen, the more the Republican side to choose to use of these associations cards issued for elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, has called for a federal state, the voters for proof of citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state that such a demand is introduced.</seg>
<seg id="29">For 2011, a dozen laws adopted by the voters States, demand that US-Staatsb to prove their citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are designed to limit the clearly hispanischen votes.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because it is clear that only two of the three hispanischen voters, prefer the democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I also Republican legislators have promoted laws in 2011 in eight states, with which the registration of voters on the day of the elections has been abolished.</seg>
<seg id="33">I also would have limited the right of individuals and groups, to make those voters want to help.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">Beispielsweise 2004 the campaigns have contributed to the registration of voters in the general election, ca. 10 million citizens to register.</seg>
<seg id="36">Because since 2009 by the measures adopted to reduce the share of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 17% in 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">laws: the Republican legislators have adopted in another five states, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote.</seg>
<seg id="38">Beispielsweise in the general election in Florida 2008 was 33% of the voters who have chosen an African American in advance, although it only 13% of the voters of the federal state.</seg>
<seg id="39">hispanische the same goes for the population.</seg>
<seg id="40">of the latter was only 11% of the electorate, and 24% of the citizens who elected in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast, the White from the 76% of the voters, only 46% of the voters who elected in advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course the democratic legislator and their trailers strongly opposed to the adoption of legislation which restrict the registration of voters.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several proposals have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Advocate - General of the United States to intervene to suspend the most contentious legislation.</seg>
<seg id="45">you were able to limit the damage in part.</seg>
<seg id="46">Beispielsweise only 16 have adopted the 34 states that the laws are showing a Lichtbildausweises.</seg>
<seg id="47">But the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The democratic critics to condemn the political nature of the legislation adopted and seeing them as a clear aim of influencing the results, in the major states for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Brennan 2011 - that those of 270 votes Wahlmännergremium are needed in order to win the Presidency, has shown that Member States have adopted this legislation, 171,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system have a considerable impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in the year 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is for sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the level of participation.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, these measures are undermining the democratic system in the United States.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs-Boson analysed</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the discovery of the probable Higgs-Bosons has aroused last summer a certain, and for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">We believe, in fact, that this Boson nothing for the majority of all the issues in the universe, less than the mechanism is involved</seg>
<seg id="4">And finally, this is the last of the particles, whose existence of the standard model, our best or the least 'wrong' explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter, empirically, but still not been observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for the physicist it is still not entirely sure that it is really the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we have a genuine new particles and that the predicted by the standard model Higgs-Boson very similar.</seg>
<seg id="7">I also believe this to be confirmed by the new data in this week on a major Physik-Kongress were presented in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data, in order to be completely safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">from walking, we nevertheless, that this is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low level of risk, and what we are looking to us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There is in this world a crucial law, which inevitably means that two objects the same place at the same time not able to be present.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not possible to keep to this rule - and you are not too much, because you will try to hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Because even if the particle physics one world really odd that, for them, also proposed such a law, which states: Ausschlussprinzip Pauli is true that two particles not fill the same place at the same time, when they are in the same 'Quantenzustand', and the 'state' by and large there is for some of their characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Davon the share a physicist the particles into two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a corner, the good of the citizens, be described as Fermione and lastly the Pauli-Prinzip.</seg>
<seg id="14">And on the other, the Bosonen a nasty gang of anarchists nothing sacred, which is in any case not of this principle, which means that they are in fact the same place at the same time can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">This divide Bosonen on the website The Particle Adventure of the laboratories Berkeley (which, incidentally, is absolutely remarkable) into two groups: the Mesonen we are not to be treated and the 'Kraftteilchen' by the spread and the major forces of nature with Higgs-Boson in a way which would be used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It must be stressed, however, that these Bosonen not all such as it could be exotic are creatures.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you are able to read this story, then, just a mediocre Bosons of exceptional: the Photon Lichtteilchen 'or' the ``is' boats the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">If that is an unimportant or accelerated change in the direction of an electrical goods' the electromagnetic fields is disturbed precisely in this place, such as' in a pebble, who was thrown into a pond where.</seg>
<seg id="19">Indeed, these ``disturbance " (an electromagnetic waves, infrared light or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a Photon Bosonen and therefore one of the`` bearer of force '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Stabileres field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">the same goes for the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another area that Higgs-Feld 'must' be disrupted, so that this Boson.</seg>
<seg id="22">But Higgs-Feld which is much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the pathogen should achieve very high energy, a bit like a frozen pond where its functions only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be.</seg>
<seg id="23">And it is a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger like CERN necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km, in order to achieve this type of energy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic fields is helpful to explain once again, the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not, in fact, all the particles are and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic fields.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, would never be a piece of paper in the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">And just as not all of the particles interact with the Higgs-Feld: those who do it, have a majority, while the other (like the Photon) have no mass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For what all these research can now be 'good' woman wondering Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For it is the science of the review of the standard passenger data model (SM), and they allow the Physikern also to examine all the differences between the observations and the predictions of SM.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are also numerous physicist, the hope that, since such exceptions are the slightest difference and plug open a door to a new 'physics some gaps, the model.</seg>
<seg id="31">You must say that the latter still major deficiencies, because it offers no explanation for the gravity - ups (!) and of the dark ca. issue that 80% of the subject matter of the universe!) (once again - ups.</seg>
<seg id="32">But not in CERN such derogations have been found by now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The effects of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no.</seg>
<seg id="35">main issues here have thought: are the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell-Laboren that their work in the early 1960s would give rise to such a revolution.</seg>
<seg id="36">you saw scientific applications, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, we have invented the late physicist Boyle Willard has already said - in the Bell Sail Labs complex has worked in which the lasers in the 1960s, which has been developed since 1962 and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (the first gepulst) has been - that the lasers, at the beginning, rather than an 'Laborspielerei was considered.</seg>
<seg id="38">posts before you...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">can also be applications but also for all the instruments that surrounded the research.</seg>
<seg id="40">Beispielsweise small Lichtsensor Willard Boyle has developed in 1969, during its work in the optics.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it is not the original purpose of this carrier was all digital cameras today throughout the world as the 'eye' and has brought him the Nobel Prize for 2009 physics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities of our life LHC necessarily change but it does mean that we really know it can never...</seg>

<seg id="16">This means that a player, as I must be inventive and its very best wishes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Carlo Ancelotti main issues here have much to me in relation to my Spielposition.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele, as I was in the same position.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti a cause for all the technicians respect.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and it is one of the best trainers of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He will look back on a rich experience and has won many title with eminent clubs.</seg>
<seg id="24">He had contact with major players.</seg>

<seg id="27">Damals I had just recovering from a Verletzungsserie.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation of my services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the Spitzenreiters us.</seg>
<seg id="31">We lurk in ambush, however.</seg>
<seg id="32">Champions League is one of our most important objectives: we have qualified for us in this way the Achtelfinale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the aim of the club in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try to come, as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">But we are against a very good European crews to have our say.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="44">Of course this would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year it is truly committed to cream off, this title.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season we were close off.</seg>
<seg id="47">In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to embrace the victory.</seg>
<seg id="48">We have reached the end of the season, with a very significant achievement.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have concluded with 79 points.</seg>
<seg id="50">should normally be master with 79 points...</seg>
<seg id="51">However, those of another team, has achieved a better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">I believe that this is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams like Marseilles I believe - Lyon - Bordeaux or the stuff that we have to gain the title, struggling</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">thinking that the media, you expect too much from the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="55">In view of what has been spent and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accept that.</seg>
<seg id="57">If, however, we are against a Heimspiel Troyes 4-0, and it is still what we have to do something, we can say with certainty, which is somewhat frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what the people expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We can never win every weekend 4-0 with.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the moment Barcelona.</seg>

<seg id="62">A team building at the time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League, we have demonstrated our strength.</seg>
<seg id="64">Manchester City looking to you, a combination of the two Saisons unable, to qualify for the Achtelfinale, and has also made huge expenditure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In view of the sums invested it was believed you to Spielpause ahead with 15 points.</seg>
<seg id="66">This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would ignore.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseilles, the last season was not good geboostet 'of this new PSG'.</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we, in the month of May will be the winner smiling and tell us that we finally, they have gained, despite all the difficulties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems to be completely Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the services provided.</seg>
<seg id="71">In order that it better Zlatan-Abh 'independence'.</seg>
<seg id="72">That means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and too many goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">And he has come and it shows that it is the 'Star the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Überall where he has played, it has led to great a player and that he is a world star with respect.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the team we respect both the players and the person.</seg>
<seg id="76">He also respect the people who surround it.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="78">This helps to improve their Spielniveau the others.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, the world is one of the best defenders, will make it possible for all the others, also to make progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French team?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">It was very important to me, to the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately my violation has also prevented Spielzeit something.</seg>
<seg id="84">I saw things that emerged strengthened from which I am.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, we will be able to achieve good Games in the national football team.</seg>
<seg id="86">This has, since I had with the 'Bleus' my hope.</seg>
<seg id="87">From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must behave in an exemplary manner in the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What do you have to consider the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the 'Bleus'?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He has achieved positive results.</seg>
<seg id="90">We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Austrian national coach is strictly, is close to the players and encourages on his victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">As it was also Laurent Blanc tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I do not want to make any comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc has to be achieved by giving us for the Euro was qualified.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="48">The demonstrators have been supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that 'we support the Fast-Food-Mitarbeiter together so that they receive and achieve a fair wage should be the economic prosperity that everyone deserves New York.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="49">According to the New York Times this was the main action of its kind in the history of the US Fast-Food-Industrie.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="78">- Concerning for thee Petersburg?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="79">- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is much more culture and a breeding ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">At our stones art can only grow.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural breeding ground for example, because we now have more than reader writers, and that is not true.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe, there are many people who are visiting organises concerts exhibitions or.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">On a similar result also seems to be a common control by Czech and the German auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The negative Praxisbeispiel it leads to the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so - called ``Schwarz-System '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlängst the Prime Minister said that the ODS hector the entrepreneurs with them or not, the system is now would be banned?</seg>
<seg id="8">must have a valid law, and if something is prohibited by law, but it is not simply the Regierungsvorsitzende, and hinder the surveillance office, whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law in its activity Kala notes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the sitting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, in the framework of the legislation on public contracts were both countries compared with each other.</seg>
<seg id="10">Worum was because in practical terms?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">There is a parallel with the review of some two years ago we started.</seg>
<seg id="12">Vereinfacht said, it is important that the European legislator lays down, public contracts are to handle the national legislation on:'.. And finally, there is the real practical application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This all we have gathered, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have seen is extremely interesting differences. It is generally said that the laws are we are perhaps even a little 'strict and perfect, but the real application in Germany is better in some parameters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">That confirms that we must always look at it again with the new and more precise rules to establish proper application of the law, is not enough.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">to what extent you the project can be a help for you? What emerges from this project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">That is precisely such a joint control could contribute to this, that we must stop constantly seeking to perfecting the laws and the lowering of thresholds, and balancing if it is apparently not very good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">efficiency means to acquire a matter of excluding and at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) illegitimate wealth or even criminal acts.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the lowering of thresholds for contracts cannot guarantee that we also achieve this objective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps it is even the case that we are a burden on the system in this way with excessive paperwork 'only' and those who seek to exploit loopholes in the system, the system simpler than the threshold values have remained higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">you talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the system works in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">Is there a similar body here as our NKÚ, or the system operates in a different way?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What concerns the authorities, it is the German equivalent NKÚ the Federal Audit Office, which is similar to what we have built up and also by a college, that will only be set up in a slightly different way. In principle, however, the two authorities are working.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Even the competences are comparable to a certain extent, and Germany is, however, a federal state, in other words that there are these courts of auditors in the individual states, the German system is different from our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The federal funding only BRH must control, which is in line with our public funds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds are managed by the districts and communities, there will be subject to the control of Landesrechnungshöfe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What concerns the German legislation, is the easier than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">What I would like this without any definite indications only Nichtsdestoweniger Germany, in some respects, is often described as a model, but we certainly cannot say that Germany in particular, is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Liegt that, perhaps, that the auditors are better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">That certainly not, but as I have said, which I do not particularly like to make comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hierzu that those countries which for us are a model, also with the problems it is facing.</seg>
<seg id="32">If this were not the case, it would not be true cooperation with our authority, not?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">What concerns the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority had Vergabegesetzes of the amendment, you have any consequences?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In view of the fact that these amendments only a short time in force, it is not yet in our assessments.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since our controls take place later, we must here with a degree of delay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">feel we have so far been rather in the preparation of future controls, we have introduced the new instrument of control and identification of risks of 'waste' in this almost 14, public procurement - examined and analysed the amendments will have an impact, of course, as the thresholds, the conditions for certain types of invitations to tender, among other things, have been modified</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Can you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think and hope that this law is a step in the right direction that confirms this assumption.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">It can, however, the problem is that the rules will be strict 'and' can no longer be respected.</seg>
<seg id="40">Right from the previous rules, a verification unterzogenen people are against the agencies (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) to be accountable, so that any failure to respect the Vergabegesetzes a violation of budgetary discipline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Is it sensible, however, then we have to make the law?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">In my opinion, it is not this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The system must exclude and those who want to abuse the system, and not penalise those who have made a formal errors, not on the actual decision - making.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">A system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Where is the solution?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">we say, first of all, what is not good.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS lay not entrepreneurs with controls of the so - called ``Schwarz-Systems' - what exactly does this mean?</seg>
<seg id="48">Is this now or permitted Schwarz-System banned?</seg>
<seg id="49">A law must, however, have its period of validity, and if something is prohibited by law, but it is not simply the Regierungsvorsitzende and impede the surveillance office, whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law, in his work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He can say: ``We amend the law and allow the matter, but he could not say that we would be as if nothing to do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">It contains a relatively strict rules on procurement law which owes much to the formal out certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition.</seg>
<seg id="52">On the other hand, however, it is also a tragedy if the offeror with the best offer Formfehlern solely on the grounds of being excluded.</seg>

<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do you manage the logistical and organisational travel?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the Gepäckraum transported in wheelchairs, we must also, of course, many Instrumentenkoffer must haul and luggage...</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless it has worked to date without its problems, and British Airways ČSA were always prepared to us very well that I have already partly I am sometimes surprised.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Indeed, you have your travel as a comparison, in the various countries with accessibility is, how it is dealing with disabled people, etc.</seg>
<seg id="46">As you have seen these things?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other towns and cities where everything works better than us in Russia, we have just seen that in the East, everything is still in its infancy.</seg>
<seg id="48">confrontation Prague Moscow is absolutely not accessible, it is still unusually, if someone using a wheelchair, is alone in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is not, of course, that we have a wheelchair users in the lift vorlässt, for example.</seg>
<seg id="50">terms Fortunately, there are also the clubs try to address the problems of people with disabilities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in what ways we have to catch up with the more developed countries?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are still many issues where we are lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="53">The same applies, that is an improvement but it also depends on the situation and the efforts of the people concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid it is perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities are self - employed in the public sphere, museum, use the toilets can move, etc.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is not just that there is a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in the public arena, we are ahead with the band The Tap Tap the West is a little.</seg>
<seg id="56">is public respect - and one thing, but only when a change from the ranks of the important things are really start, athletes, artists and actors, to be politicians or lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken figures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Tap Tap is currently very popular, however. If we go back a couple of years, is motivated to you: What has happened in 1998, to set up a bond?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">I went to Damals Jedlička as carers, the Institute, where I met many young people who were keen to deal with something.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I myself am a Musik-AG Saxofon and musicians and I have established, together with a colleague.</seg>
<seg id="61">Na, and in time, that is, as our facilitator, Láďa Angelovič, tends to say, somewhat out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Volume Bekannt but which was only in recent years, or are we not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that the cooperation with also well - known Sängern we have started to have also helped; actively for us.</seg>
<seg id="64">We are aware of the fact that it has become rather, and this is not to see the merit, in some sense, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to the EU, we can make our good teachers and high - quality products, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">War, it aims to get it with The Tap Tap?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the start, I have heard the potential that we can tackle the situation is different.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the branch of show business today that is often one of the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is logical, on its way with caution, because anything new only after a long time, and will be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are only a few things that are truly unique and, I would venture to claim that Tap Tap is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression that the public has often, there is, of course, and this is only natural.</seg>
<seg id="72">But this sympathy is totally superfluous, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned we would regret that.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if people with disabilities, something that is not only to themselves is a step forward, but for the whole of society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">War for this success is also useful that you are strictly a head, as we heard from many people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If you want to make something good, we should not make any compromises on many things, and must also demand a certain degree of discipline.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is, I think, but completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some come to us with a romantic ideas, and then, when they see that they have twice a week, to undertake stages and spend a lot of time on the enthusiasm, sponsoring concert tours then many of them quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">This is how it works but everywhere, in every bond, the serious work and wants to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">A The Tap Tap has twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were from the outset, namely that since 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Just one: Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group. The people come and go. The one can prevent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week, Poland has been received with him on the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a member of this space body zwanzigstes. Poland is the second Member State from the former Eastern bloc countries (to the Czech Republic, that on 12 November 2008 was ESA-Mitglied).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland in 1994 close cooperation began with the ESA and participated in the following years in several ESA-Projekten.</seg>
<seg id="4">The path of Poland in the space of course, start much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The very before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte are employed in the space sector, but they were not always easy to understand.</seg>
<seg id="6">I recall, for example, of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw observatory, in which the author of its pioneering ideas presented Kosmonautik included 'to'.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer. 1905) (and the people were, however, and following years, only Šternfeld that Dr Jan Gadomski shown interest in his work has reminded us.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld won in 1934 Kosmonautik 'for' entrance to the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten REP-Hirsch announcing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr Jan Gadomski (he later - 1996) has been an important supporter of astronomy and space industry.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines published and hundreds of articles he wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomskis of internationally recognised contribution to the development of space has been appreciated by, among other things, that a Krater erdabgewandten on the side of the moon after he was appointed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Right in the year in Poland in 1925 a Eisenbahn-Draisine was built on a Raketenantrieb was planned.</seg>
<seg id="13">The author of the text and the details of this project, unfortunately I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not yet clear whether the rocket the brakes or off the Draisine should be used.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information that come exclusively from the contemporary press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">In 1933 to the Polish infantry started raketenbetriebenen with bullets.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research, the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.</seg>
<seg id="18">is clear that research for the documents provided to the stage of practical tests was.</seg>
<seg id="19">The research was interrupted by the invasion, of course, then the German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the year of 1937 appeared in the press of the message of originating. Rohoziński draft fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete, and the following year, the work was' Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza 'Leliwa-Krzywoblocky of the author.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.</seg>
<seg id="22">short before the war were all projects to military use of the missile technology by the person who was scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).</seg>
<seg id="23">The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of hard work was its work by the end of the war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another article appeared after the war, the aerospace and thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">The first discussion of this takes place in society in 1954 Novemberausgabe Problemy the magazine, in the four major article devoted to the space industry.</seg>
<seg id="26">The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time, there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the research of space would have a future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Right in its inception in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA tried to join up to the 1951 International Federation for space travel, and indeed the PTA has already been in the autumn of 1956 proper Member.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the following year, was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), vice - chairman of the International Federation for space travel.</seg>
<seg id="30">This office he has been holding up to his death in 1959.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since the 1956 PTA significantly involved in the development of the most successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type RM-1, which was concluded in 1957, the first start was made on 10 October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rockets with a maximum altitude of 1 800 metres around 80 cm was long and weighed not entirely 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Später an improved version, which was built RM-1A, in 1959, and started in the test flights Błędów - desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket 1.4 m was long and weighing kg approximately 11.5.</seg>
<seg id="36">Another development should already be in a position to provide genuine scientific work and the missile RM-34 should achieve an altitude of up to 14.5 km for the monitoring of Höhenwinden.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 1962, however, the further development has been discontinued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">successor of the first type RM the rockets in 1962 to 1965 Meteor-1-Rakete developed.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket, was conceived Zweistufenrakete than 510 cm was their overall length and the take - off weight was 32 500 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">From this missile (Meteor-1A three types have been developed, -1 B -1 and C in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport, with 0.4 litres Meteor-1B on 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C on 0,62 litre.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum altitude, in all three types of 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the years to 1968 in the 1965 Luftfahrtinstitut Meteor-2-Rakete has been developed, the first test flights in 1970 began in October.</seg>
<seg id="44">Meteor-2 had a take - off weight of 380 kilograms, and was able to implement a 10 kg in a level of around 60 km.</seg>
<seg id="45">after the versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Erwähnenswert is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, the two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland participated in the framework of the Interkosmos-Programms also with Soviet satellite in space, and in 1978, was the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut second.</seg>

<seg id="1">The lifting of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week of the Constitutional Court, the law on non - profit - making activities.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision was a lively debate in the public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is interesting to look at the issue again in a broader perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal - oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world, are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In effect, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">the principle is that of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, with the unbridled speculation to go hand in hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) will Preisspannungen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this concept of a state is, to understand the manufacturers to be tried, by means of import cheaper goods in the economic competition, undercutting 'competition' to a larger market and to increase its profits.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a large scale, this means for the majority of companies or to relocate their production abroad to buy cheap there, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the private sector will be no social responsibility and, therefore, no responsibility for unemployment necessarily caused by the increase in public spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">This situation is made even worse by the fact that these gentlemen will entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and in the way they have caused to replace overall economic and social damage.</seg>
<seg id="13">This situation is well known, so that specific statistics on this point are superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="14">The brutal practice of private capital in the individual economies to create a situation in which the governments are forced to enter into competition with each other, in order to artificially reduce the level of social and their own people to attract foreign investment into the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words, the governments will provide for their own people, without any regard for the social consequences of the private capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is particularly in changes to existing legislation.</seg>
<seg id="17">it is the aim of these measures, to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is the result of economic pressure on a long - term unemployment, on the other, the exclusion of workers' rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The outcome is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the rich and the poor.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are several years, public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people, are no longer able to feed through their own work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of people affected is already in the million.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the wake of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly cases in which employees are given such a low pay, that the state to increase their income below subsistence level.</seg>
<seg id="23">One such scandal was also brought to light in the case of workers employed in the German Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity üdstaaten practically all EU will undoubtedly be in the same situation in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate, (as was the case in the 19th century, or for a pittance on the margins of society and about whom we hope that some private capital will be channelled into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are naturally, the question of where this capital?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it is from another EU country, only the poverty moves from one country to another, from the capital or remains altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees are working for a fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This concerns the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theories and media allege that ad nauseam that the state is not with capital to its own economy, and that involved a planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="29">The private sector a narrow - minded insists on its position, that the state lenkend not intervene in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then, but the question is whether this is the whole of the State affected in their own selfish interests, or even not the policy and capital.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here the clear answer is yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all Member States.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, of legislation in which practically everything, but nothing is criminally punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany, the situation is that a lack of finance private Staatsministerium is responsible, with the industry verflochtene Rechtsunternehmen with the drafting of legislative proposals.</seg>
<seg id="35">This draft legislative proposals be adopted later in the Bundestag.</seg>
<seg id="36">All violence is not more popularly announce, such as the western constitutions, but rather by strong financial groups, their own interests.</seg>

<seg id="42">politicians, journalists and the public and to try to persuade them to get on our side in order to achieve these objectives.</seg>
<seg id="43">When President, it is not a problem for me to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties broadcast live on television, the substantive criminal law and to establish liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="44">And the Angesprochenen would say if necessary, then, why do they object to this.</seg>
<seg id="45">A strong personality, which refers to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take your only once the direct election of the President, which has been a credit to the public pressure.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="47">I would like to say quite clearly that I am an amateur I am neither a genius; an enlightened.</seg>
<seg id="48">I am trying to find allies for my views and vision.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="51">That sounds as though a little Okamura should save the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I am not.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that I can do nothing for that reason alone, I have talked with several famous people whether they do not wish to stand for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="54">I have spoken with Radim Jančura for example, rejected, however, as a result of the excessive.</seg>
<seg id="55">I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová had, the fraud in the trade in a light fuel oil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">I began my candidacy with the requirement that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sechzig% of the electorate are not left to the elections, and who are elected representatives have been mostly the establishment.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Senate we are only two independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people have chosen Senatszusammensetzung a that such changes will be very difficult to implement.</seg>
<seg id="60">Even so, I shall fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and Bezirkshauptmänner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">that you thought about the establishment of the EU's own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">I think I have not yet, because I have no time to review the past, and that any potential Parteimitglieds also do not have the money for it.</seg>
<seg id="63">I do not even have money to Präsidentenkampagne; my transparent accounts CZK only 20 000.</seg>

<seg id="64">You have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">Vermögenserklärungen you are talking about, what would you?</seg>

<seg id="66">My personal fortunes I value of around CZK 60 million.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague I have a piece of land, with a value of ECU 25 million, a home for around 10 million to 8 million, a further an art collection, which belongs, which is worth about 10 million, and a Ashton Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about a million. And then I have a couple of million to the bank account.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Ashton Martin was a Kindertraum James Bond - I was always been, as it was in the car galant was to women and, at the same time, against the evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Martin a Ashton, you have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">you say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you want to invest in this.</seg>
<seg id="71">That is not very convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I do not have 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Should I make up about debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have any sponsors, shows that the programme is not a great deal of interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged to provide the campaign from its own resources.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign, in essence, be covered by my salary as a senator.</seg>
<seg id="78">But the Senatorengehalt I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not finance the English schools, the 30 000 per month.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I only wanted to earn money, I would be able to stand for nothing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: ``German greater role to play '</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has in the vote on the reception of Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to expert, Stephen Szabo US-Europ - European relations, Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">firstly: Deutsche Welle indicated at the beginning of the week, as Germany, that it was against the application for observer status for the Palestinians would vote at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Then, however, contain Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have not done.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany must be given its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate to its independence, without, however, to be critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Throughout the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstain, as it were, to establish a no - fly zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was achieved by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="13">Fällt it difficult on important international issues, Germany, to take a clear position?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, it is true.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that it has just been surrounded and its foreign policy away from a policy of the United States, as it were, to pay a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Erschwerend that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform have added to this policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans, that is, between the lines.</seg>
<seg id="18">One of them is that they play a more independent role, but they are not used.</seg>
<seg id="19">I believe that they are making are still in their role, but they are on the way to a more normal 'foreign policy'.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, as they have in France or the United Kingdom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What means a'n ormal 'foreign policy as from a German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">you shows the willingness to national interests, to adopt positions, which are independent of the United States or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy of economic policy, in other words by the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East, is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany to protect economic interests to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and Germany must therefore its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Did they had economic impact on the attitude of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="27">And we must be careful, the public, but also the elites, not only in the Arab countries.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is definitely a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not want to attach a great deal of weight, that is not wholly unilateral relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it is definitely an important role in German considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Where Germany damaged its relations with the United States, by the vote on major decisions such as the vote on Palestine has to contain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I believe in Europe, and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding for the German position.</seg>
<seg id="33">And I do not believe that this is a just as in the Libyan question was more dramatic rift.</seg>
<seg id="34">Maybe einspielen Germany will also ensure that even a certain respect.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because it signals that it as an international players must be taken seriously and its interests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">There are different views in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States, have clearly in favour of a veto.</seg>
<seg id="38">Are there any differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The American domestic affairs of these differences have always existed.</seg>
<seg id="40">I believe that the government under President Obama has, without a great deal of understanding for the European position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But because of the political situation is, of course, the government could not publicly supported that position.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the real differences of opinion as it always does not seem to be so great.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama, President Obama is not so enthusiastic about taken by Netanyahu hellauf policy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Fällt Germany it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans, if it were a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">So they will not be part of a broader approach and we must instead push things from their own point of view.</seg>
<seg id="48">The make it is with the euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I believe that Germany will in future play a leading role, to urge Europe to a European position.</seg>
<seg id="50">That is, of course, not just to Germany, because the relationship with Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">That has always been a sensitive issue.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I believe that is the German clear that they play a more independent role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Sieht even in Germany's role as an important international players - Germany wants to play a leading role at all?</seg>
<seg id="54">Oder, Germany is still difficult for the leadership role?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still not being used, it is embarrassing and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we look at the example of the euro crisis, because each time when Germany, adopts a greater role, various anti-deutsche feelings.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is not just the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="58">That is actually the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.</seg>
<seg id="59">Germany However, in a far worse position than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Well, the influence of the United States is continuously in European policy, the EU does not, for the moment, this vacuum, who is otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if they do not like it, and a lot of them is an unpleasant unpopular, c' est la vie it!</seg>

<seg id="1">My mexikanisch-amerikanische identity crisis.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Many people were forced to leave because of the lack of opportunities, Mexico</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans have a tendency to blame the immigrants, they call them difficult times, he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent visit to Mexico City I had only just cuts through the hall and the passport was reached, a dilemma in me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">signs referred to two queues: 'A 'for' Mexicanos Mexicans "), the other for 'Extranjeros ' (' aliens").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I was there, a few seconds, to which I should like to go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I grew up in Zentralkalifornien and all my life was called 'the Mexicans ."</seg>
<seg id="9">An ethnic acronym - just as my friends in Boston 'or' Irish my friends in New York 'Italian'.</seg>
<seg id="10">I decided Später Mexikanisch-Amerikanisch 'for'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But that Mexico has been here.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the country of my grandfather, there was no need for Kürzeln or Bindestrichen.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was simply Americans.</seg>
<seg id="14">I am at least in Spanish, good enough for me to say in this language two ends in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers my American emphasis, and I will not go well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So, I took my American passport and undertook in the queue for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought at the moment, this week, as the future President of Mexico Nieto Pena Enrique went to the White House in order to meet with President Obama.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the agenda all those issues which were expected to take if the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy, you are talking about is a reason for this is that today, with a high probability of Mexicans, in Mexico, rather than emigrating to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading block for example of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto swore to Mexico, the war against the drug cartels, even if he has any details in this respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full Ressentiment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Americans are most probably never been a single idea that the United States in 1848 invaded in Mexico and have forced the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun to leave them to more than half of their territory.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for the Mexicans in centuries in minutes, and not to have to think back to this event.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As soon as a US-Regierungsbeamter is therefore only one hears mildeste criticism of Mexico, in the Mexican press and the elites of the country, complaints, as the Americans are bringing pressure to bear on the sovereignty of their neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children themselves Montezumas on the war - path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">desire to talk about sentiments?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has winners and losers, people, for the country, and offers opportunities for the other, it does not.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas example, in Denver, or San Antonio live, is that of a point in our family tree, a person may be a parent or Großelternteil was necessary, and no chance in Mexico towards auswanderte north.</seg>
<seg id="32">And, in the majority of cases, this person was a profile - brown - skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are the offspring of these people, and our allegiance to them.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And although we now live, perhaps, the American dream, that it does not have good jobs, the Mexican. American the dream which have visited and good schools we live, we must never lose sight of the fact, is.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is certainly the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I also we are aware that not many Members may the Mexican ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="39">This is based on reciprocity.</seg>
<seg id="40">you see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not sufficiently mexikanisch.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">your opinion, our existence is a symbol of the failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If not, our families in Mexico, they would not have had failed.</seg>
<seg id="44">And then we would see us now caught behind the Seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child einwanderte legally in the United States, I am reminded that, between Mexicans and Mexican Americans are tension because Mexicans have a clearer picture of what they are, and who Mexican Americans, they take.</seg>
<seg id="46">While they American citizen, it is, as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, many Mexican Americans, who I know have the feeling that neither the one nor the other country.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the Mexican bond lot Tigres del Norte region, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have the best of both worlds, but it is not rooted in.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico we be seen as the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States we be seen as Mexicans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">As I should learn during my trip, there is something more complicated this relationship: Some Mexican leaders Bildungsbürgertums wish to include and parts of their links to the diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">you want to use as a provisional Mexican Americans' ambassador 'for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We should tell our American colleagues, and put pressure on as great a visit to the country's political leadership to intensify its relations with Mexico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Now.</seg>
<seg id="56">That will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Unfortunately, feelings of many injured.</seg>
<seg id="58">And in view of the unfair distribution of incomes, the extensive corruption and Drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I fear that these Amigos, it alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">That is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some of the Mexicans are not yet ready to the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, a resentment, to grant it must also accept, that some of the Mexican Americans with their family members, as it was not so long ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are 'Mexicans, as I thought'.</seg>

<seg id="1">old battles, new Middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The cease - fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be unexpected cornerstone for peace</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Will it ever be lasting peace between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest bloody events seem to nip in the bud any such hope.</seg>
<seg id="5">Amidst the usual blame countless buildings - were killed in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis, for the first time and rockets from Gaza are taken in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, while the Israelis and the Palestinians in their historic conflict in the Middle East are changing around them.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab spring has created a new situation, uncertain, and whether or not they want it Palestinians and Israelis have been part of this turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="8">Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to believe that the situation could be at the end of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war will be lost, not yet been won</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation as anything else would seem to be appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the on the 21  November week's battles have strengthened the cease - fire agreed Hartgesottenen continues to both sides.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have fostered by the Israelis, although his group had even large losses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although several of the Hamas leader killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in a desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet have not succeeded in Israel are packed up to now, to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, Hamas in the West Bank, which is a rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah is controlled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">And the Hamas leader could come to the conclusion that they have the time on their side.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, such as Islamists in the Arab world, of influence have won, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends can draw on their side.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Turkey, a regional power wiedererstarkende, in the past, as Israel's closest ally, Muslim was taken to the Hamas - party like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Jubelnde Hamas-Anh Gong believe that by Israel, Lebanon in the Islamic north Crescent, is where the militant Hizbollah has the power, Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren - style Stürzung Bashir Assad, might stand up to Jordan, where Hamas-Verb ündete the King.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - einwohnerstärksten and by far the principal Arab country - from the southern flank of Israel has changed in the balance of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the secular tyrant up to his fall 30 years 2011, had little time left for Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast to the brotherhood verschwägert is with the Hamas and its leaders Volksansichten more dependent.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future, the Hamas diplomatic negotiations could prove to be an actor, even by Israel and the United States could not be squeezed out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Israeli hardliners on the other hand, I consider the opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hamas is no risk Militärisch seen more.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli missile defence system, ``Iron Dome 'has been able to prove its worth and many of the rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Zumindest a period of calm and Israel will be able to go to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="28">The diplomatic firmly believe that the United States remain steadfast in its position. Many European countries have made responsible for the latest Gewalteskalationen Hamas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Israel is good to have in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who ignored the peace process has, to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although rockets from Gaza killed since 2004, around 30 Israelis, the country is, have remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the Sperranlagen in the West Bank and in the main part of a possible hineinverlaufen Palestinian State. This the Jewish settlements, which is to protect a breach of international law have been declared, but always be developed further.</seg>
<seg id="31">Netanyahu. His Likud is a good ally, in the run - up to the elections on 22 January, Avigdor Lieberman, with a still kämpferischeren group.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why do these hinterlistigen Palestinians to nanny and also leave a State?</seg>
<seg id="33">If they do, in fact, the control of the West Bank, they would not have faces as well as their comrades - in - arms in Gaza also missiles?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, it is better to keep it short and to punish the wall in check, you should dare to raise your heads.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Perhaps the hardliners will be able to guarantee the Arab spring. However, they could be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists, who are sitting now on they will be in place in Egypt and in other countries with difficulties in the country's own power, have very little left over for Israel,</seg>
<seg id="37">The Verteidigungsetat of Israel is greater than with its four Arab neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="38">A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in the restoration of their economy.</seg>
<seg id="39">The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi zusammentat with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a ceasefire, and perhaps to represent the beginning of a new era, and could be a promising sign -</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Even Israelis should think long - term.</seg>
<seg id="41">Throughout the rest of the Arab world is making democratisation timid steps in the direction of the Palestinians' right to self - determination - continue to be deprived of their, which is undoubtedly a powder keg, one day in the Israeli - occupied territories will explode, just as this week, there was an explosion in a bus in Tel Aviv.</seg>
<seg id="42">The repression already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only get worse.</seg>
<seg id="43">Blutige missions for the eradication of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly calling for its diplomatic over the years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a boost from outside</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The answer is, those of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper: two states, in which Israel for security purposes are waived areas.</seg>
<seg id="46">The small, in the near future - hope that the ceasefire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt must stop now working with Turkey and Qatar the supply of arms in the Gaza Strip is better placed than ever before, to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="48">Arab nations outside the Hamas and Fatah should move to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="49">That more is done for the creation of a Palestinian State, as with the forthcoming proposal on UN-Beobachterstatus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Even Obama to play its part, to persuade Israel to negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term he missed the presentation of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Weit in white House, it seems, it would be equally unwilling to participate in it.</seg>
<seg id="53">However, this is a deplorable, short - term perspective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States have a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">After long read Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of almost 100 people were Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that, as the experience of boredom 'exercise, a satisfactory result, it does not want to be able to define'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person, but this would not work.</seg>
<seg id="22">The apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to 'disturbance of Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slow'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">boredom can listen to this almost as depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But, although Professor Eastwood believe these two conditions in relation to people are bored could see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes we that is boring us, even if we do not just have to focus.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their report 'The Unengaged Mind Defining Boredom in terms: Attention' in German, for instance: ``The untätige reason: The definition of boredom in terms of 'attention in September in the journal' Perspectives on Psychological Science 'appeared, Professor out Eastwood, and his colleagues on an earlier experiment in a single volume, the participants to listen to a Magazinartikel read a person.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups have heard a resounding channel from the neighbouring region, which has nothing to do with the content was heard it on others; low noise level, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group is not at all a noise, I heard this.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The people who have heard the barely recognisable television, to try to have more boredom as the other two groups - they had problems to focus, for this could be no reason to their difficulties and wrote the boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If you try to concentrate on a difficult and demanding task could lead to disruption of boredom, Mark says J. Fenske for neuroscience progresses, associative professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">If, on the other hand, makes for tedious work into 'as the search for defective products on a Fabrikförderband that music bored and can help to feel, not'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln Kritzeln and often interpreted as a sign of boredom, this can even be fought by physical persons to be more vigilant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">'studies have shown that children learn herumhampeln Professor more and more than those who are forced to Stillsitzen' Fenske must keep information.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">We will, at some point, all wearing my delayed flight - a dröhnender, loudspeakers particularly ermüdender film industry.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people bore more easily than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">In order for these differences, researchers - developed in the 1980s to a' scale Langeweileanfälligkeit '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Following the statements such as' will find many things that I have to do is repeat and monotonous' and'I have many interests, that I do not have enough time for everything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">help of such scale researchers have discovered that more girls than boys, tedious as Stephen Vodanovich, a professor at the University of psychology Westflorida, in particular, as regards the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But in general are a fairly abgespannter bunch of teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson by Professor for human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment where he kontaktierte almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found out that 32% of adolescents in schools and in the homework Erledigen if they were not at school, whereas bored and bored, 23%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">However, only 3% of parents to have to feel bored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson now saying that he does not know whether the exact percentages 21 years later, in terms of boredom have increased or decreased.</seg>
<seg id="44">He is sure, however, that 'the young people as extremely boring because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their mainly perceived Alltagsablauf.'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Back to my Ursprungsfrage: Is boredom healthy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes, in extreme cases, because it means that people and extreme physical risks to gambling, or drugs, in order to alleviate the studies have shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Andererseits many philosophers and authors to examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich the issue of research, for more than two decades.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">'With the boredom the brain want to say that we should do something different, Mr Marcus, psychology professor at the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain, do not always know what is best in particular.</seg>
<seg id="50">If a dull and the energy we use to play and to cook Gitarre, you will be happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">However, in the short term for TV can ensure that these verflüchtigen Glücksgefühle long term, but again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">If his bored child is an iPad, so that it can be diverted from boredom. It has not, however, in order to maintain or to control, Professor Fenske says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And it also adds that 'self - regulation is a situation of' on the other.</seg>
<seg id="54">The baby learns, not only to maintain but also in other areas to be more self - regulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I do not think we should celebrate boredom.</seg>
<seg id="56">Even we should not be too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Stattdessen our aim should be to us at ease outside the permanent Aktivitäts and Technologieberieselung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood to the vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">'It sounds as we often have to be boring. But boredom is distressing, relentless desire to do something meaningful', he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">He believes that the people are in reality, only after a way, to shut down and less so.</seg>

<seg id="14">you are waiting for a report on the establishment of the licensing systems of production, production, distribution and sale of drugs - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Washington, we are of the opinion that, in any case, Colorado the majority of States, which is the subject of the regulation of marijuana. drugs legalised, which was only for medical purposes, and then Eigenkonsum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">'Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore right for the orientation, Brian E. Smith said, the spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But to Smith also that no place or system more than in the sense of a broad guidelines to be able to do that.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington I-502 law, on 6 December, to enter into force and thus represents the end point in a grey area in which the State licensing system to legalise possession, but still does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="20">And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be clarified in this period, for example, such as the imposition of a state 'adequate access to' lizenziertem marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften around 300 metres for schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.</seg>

<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of Landkreises, shows the possession of small quantities of adults.</seg>
