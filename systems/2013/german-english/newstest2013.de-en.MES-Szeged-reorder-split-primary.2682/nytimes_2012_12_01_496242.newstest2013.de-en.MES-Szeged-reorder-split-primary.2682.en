In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is a good time to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about boredom.
I will not lie.
Wait a half day at the airport on a flight, is quite nervtötend - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to you, it is for us, and our children - is okay, occasionally to be bored.
So that the brain is forced into interesting thoughts to lose, which promotes the creativity.
And because most of us today, almost always on the screen, giving us the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
This brings me back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which develops with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "boredom: a Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it that way.
"Indeed, the boredom, a very long history," he says.
The house walls pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti on boredom, which goes back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom is defined in many ways and discussed.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that to boredom, as the experience, "a satisfying work, but it will not be able to define themselves."
Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person is not concerned, but this is going to be.
The apathy, on the other hand, there is no rush to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disruption of attention process, coupled with a bad temper and a sense that time passes slowly."
Boredom can listen to almost as such as depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be seen in the context of bored people the problem in the environment or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that is boring, even if we just have to concentrate on.
In their study, "The unengaged Mind: defining boredom in terms of attention" to "the idle minds: the definition of boredom, from the point of view of the attention," which was published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television program from the neighboring area, this has nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group heard this noise at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for them and signed their difficulties of boredom.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom, Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study said.
However, if you put a monotonous activities, "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help to do not feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom can fight, even by people remain physically more closely.
"Studies have shown that children who must herumhampeln learn more and more information for those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all will eventually dull - my pretenii dröhnender flight, according to the spokesman, a particularly ermüdender film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980s to a "vulnerability" scale of boredom.
On the scale are statements such as "many things that I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But, in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter clusters.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development conducted at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents were bored in school and do the homework, while 23 percent said they would be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents gave in to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
He was sure, however, that "the youth perceived as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers should not have a big impact on their daily lives.
So back to my original question: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people take extreme physical risks and the gambling or drug addicted to relieve you - the studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Vodanovich, professor of the issue for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain will tell you that you should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of as New York.
But the brain do not know what you do best.
If one is boring and you this energy used to cook and play guitar, we will be happy.
But television can ensure happiness for the short-term, but in the long term this evaporate.
A bored child who is an iPad, enough so that it can distract from the boredom. It has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, Professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to talk, but also in other areas more self-control.
I do not believe that we should be celebrating boredom.
We should also see them not to be critical.
Instead, our aim should be to us too far away from the constant activity and Technologieberieselung.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth just look for a way to unwind and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly stimulated, it is difficult to deal with, even if the noise is silent."
