With Bitcoin pay and selling without bank is possible.
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified and transaction processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies to reach a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies designed to financial crises.
In fact, this is of Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (dollar, euro convertible, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange as BitTorent, which provides for the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network about 200,000 transactions were already covered.
Several thousand Web pages Bitcoin accept a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had five months later, he fell to 2 dollars today, before it recovered to around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the Web site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to the world trade by Realen currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) shows in an October report on virtual currencies interest.
She describes as "the virtual Bitcoin currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a video game, you win the game or buy (and sometimes to share).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, the trade is controlled by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin network nodes are all at the same time, the invoice book, securities firms, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user choose a different address for each payment, which the anonymity.
A number of this transaction-related data will be signed electronically through a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins are traded in the entire network of widespread accounting book of public accounts.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is happening on a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, is a sort of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e., the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
"The use of" the new transaction and add a number, before the whole thing will be hacked. "
The goal is to find the one number that gives a unique fingerprint (many leading zeroes).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can look effortless, whether it is the right thing to do.
The transaction is thus linked permanently with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay to defraud two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without Verkn√É1, because both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The circulating in Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, leaving a margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is improving with each performance.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stole the Bitcoin deposits.
"The common vulnerability does not affect the actual Minutes," Pierre Noizat Paymium, has introduced a company to pay with real money and the network Bitcoin uses assured.
The ECB also reported on the activities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash has also these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations.
Others, such as the blog platform WordPress they are accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyses of the Weizmann Institute in Israel and the invoice book shows that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-Schlussverkauf" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company, the Bitcoins Coinabul converted into gold.
, Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on the currency is a firm believer in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses but Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system can be implemented easily with retailers, and the latter must install any new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to give an address that can be photographed by a telephone "and recognized," Pierre Noizat indicates that assured that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend, the hierarchical systems are covered in favor of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time before Bitcoin prevails in 2013, but could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, moreover, to assess the various, today as high-risk in the event of a success of this currency.
