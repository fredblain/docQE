Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas udovít could prove to be a cornerstone for peace
There can be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events such Movimientos seem to nip in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations were countless buildings to rubble and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them killed civilians, and six Israelis - and the first time rockets are taken from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, changed the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could eventually find their end.
A war that neither lost nor gained will
At first glance, seems optimistic given the current situation than anything else.
Even if the 21 November agreed ceasefire holds, this week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007 will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although his group itself has seen large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and packed the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in a dense desolatesten bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, wins the Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists won in the Arab world, Hamas can learn powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once seen as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has seized on the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren embossing could face the Stürzung Bashar Assad's, to Jordan, where Hamas-allied threaten the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi inhabitants - by far the strongest and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region.
The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations Hamas could prove to be a player who can not be from Israel and the United States wooed.
Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion.
In military terms Hamas is no longer dangerous.
The Israeli anti-missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove themselves, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
For a while, at least, Israel will not be able to sleep peacefully.
In diplomatic terms the United States hold firm on its position, many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who ignored the peace process to a large degree.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed 30 Israelis have since 2004, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the closing plants, which lost in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. This will protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared as illegal under international law, however, will continue to expand.
Netanyahu as well. His Likud party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on January 22, Avigdor Lieberman, with an even kämpferischeren group.
Nanny why these scheming Palestinians and leave them in a state of their own?
If you really are in control of the West Bank, they are not exactly like their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip, including firing missiles?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in chess and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to carry the day. But the Arab Spring could make them.
Even if the Islamists who now in Egypt and in other countries in the seat of power, there is little left for Israel, they will focus initially on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense budget is larger than that of Israel's four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab governments little in the overhaul of its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama, working together to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
The Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians will continue to be stripped of their right to self-determination - a powder keg waiting to explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week, a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
Now the oppression undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation is only going to get worse.
Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from foreign
The right answer is represented by the more representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two states, Israel is for security purposes.
The - for the near future small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders granted more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must stop now, along with Turkey and Qatar, the arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
It would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama also must play its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term he missed the presentation of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also reluctant to participate in it.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
