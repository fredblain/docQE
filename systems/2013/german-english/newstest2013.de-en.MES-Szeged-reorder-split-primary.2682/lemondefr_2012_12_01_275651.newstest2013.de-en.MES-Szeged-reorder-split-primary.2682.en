"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season they have adopted with PSG a new dimension.
How would you explain this progress?
You can say it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on its side.
The technical staff gave me too much.
These elements spur me on a daily basis to improve my game.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football everything goes very quickly.
But I break in enthusiasm.
Since my start in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
You are thus introduced by Carlo Jeff competitive advantage...
The newcomers this summer are accustomed to playing very high levels.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me who must face and his best wishes to be.
Incidentally, Jeff Carlo gives me a lot in terms of my game position.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Jeff is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Jeff inspires all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no Compareable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He draws on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
This time I had just recovered from an injury.
The trust he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 has taken the place of Lyon, while only finishers are awarded sprint points.
But we lurk in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League is: we have qualified for us in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we are going to play against a very good European teams have our say.
First of all, we want to be first in our group, Porto, so that we can carry out the return leg of the Achtelfinales as home game.
The PSG can be in the short term, a major European club?
He already has the budget...
In order to be a great European club, Paris has to win the title and make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
PSG is the financial resources to make this project takes concrete forms.
It would be a big failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really at the heart of this volume.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough in order to secure the victory.
We have finished the season with a strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I believe that this is the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been spent and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept that.
But if we can win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and we still have a little place, which they accuse us, it is a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
You look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, failed to qualify for the first knockout round, and has also made huge expenditure.
In relation to the sums invested believed you to the game with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup would ignore.
, Lyon and Marseille, who were in the last season was not good geboostet of this new PSG. "
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that we won it, despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better that people speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals.
That is why he has come and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has to see that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respected the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the world's best defenders, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was for me to take part in the heart of this European Championship.
Unfortunately, to slap me my injury prevented some game time.
I saw things that I am emerged stronger.
Today, I will be able to achieve good games in the national team.
Since this was my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what occurred in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson and now we need to put an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national team coach is strictly, is close to the players and the victory.
As Laurent Blanc was it.
But I would like to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal when he qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" after Brazil.
The 16 October forced a draw in Spain (1: 1) an opening match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
Before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
