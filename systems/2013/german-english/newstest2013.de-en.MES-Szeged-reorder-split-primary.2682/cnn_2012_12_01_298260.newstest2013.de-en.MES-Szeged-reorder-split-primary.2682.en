My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced by the lack of opportunities to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - call them in difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport control, as confusion in me.
Signs point to two queues: one for "mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure to what I should go.
I grew up in central California and was my whole life, "Mexicans."
An ethnic symbol - just as my friends in Boston, "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."
Later, I opted for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or dashes.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to compete in this language on both ends of the interviews.
But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not Conserva.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros.
I thought about those moment this week, as the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues, which are expected to meet the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to remain in Mexico to emigrate rather than in the United States.
He would like to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc modeled after the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against Mexico's drug cartels, although he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States in 1848 a fell in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun, forced to leave them more than half its territory.
But for Mexicans, the thinking in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event will not be overlooked.
Therefore, once a US government official also performs only mildest criticism of Mexico, you can hear it - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children Montezumas go on the war path.
But the greatest challenge in Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not do that.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio life, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parents or grandparents part - got no chance in Mexico and in the direction of North emigrated.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we are living the American dream, perhaps now visited good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred may sometimes, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is clearly in the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class do not like.
This is based on reciprocity.
They look at us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion of our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not now caught behind the silk curtain, with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and, as a child, legally in the United States, was reminded me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans resent them.
While it is an American citizen, she sees itself as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans Campane, have the feeling to belong neither to the one nor to the other country.
The Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte love, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It has the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes it even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated bourgeoisie want to take their connections to the diaspora.
You Mexican Americans want to use as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico to defend their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of incomes, the rampant corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I am afraid, because it by Cackling alone, friends.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans bear a grudge for how their family members were discussed until not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.
