Palliative care - the best way to die... | le devoir
With your Committee for "death with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of the living.
The debate must be included in the near future, although a bill is being prepared.
However, in this important area, much remains to be done.
Le devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the montérégie.
The prostate cancer, the aufzehrte him, he had a period of two years.
"They gave me to live five years, I made seven years," he said, half-hearted in his bed at the home of Victor-Gadbois beloeil in palliative care, in which he had arrived the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, and you can't be prepared," he says.
The disease does its job: an immense weakness prevents him from to go to the bathroom alone and even to eat.
On the table before a delicious lunch, agrees to help he resigned, to get the food.
Brave it manages to smile and even to talk with the stranger, which employs around him, bring him his medication, and give him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, since this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this malady.
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man pinkelt in the face," Pierre had 10 shutouts, a psychologist at the Home, Victor-Gadbois told.
In the early stage of an unacceptable humiliation is to return for some people.
"That depends on the ability of the person," to take a step backwards, he notes.
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, in the midst of this major setbacks.
The patients who are placed in the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, you will be inundated by the doctors and nurses who care for them, not with the so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is aware of, "and" to die of suffocation.
But the disease, I have learned my children really know.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have no more hope in life," she says, before she accepted that it puts on a mask, which helps her breathe.
They expected in the next few days still have a last visit their son, who is from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois offering with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the food intake.
The palliative care will be used if there are no other options.
To make the dying.
In Quebec a bed for the palliative care comes to 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little, if you take into account the fact that we all die one day.
Here, life will continue under the best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
Given the dying according to request an oral care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we have a beer served Mr X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," nursing director Nathalie Savard reported.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is not like the other day.
In addition to an old man from 93 years, enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and well supported by his pillow, while one is in his honor, dies, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children, tragically, after he tried to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds are filled with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years ago," said Dr. Christiane Martel tells worried.
53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to relieve the suffering of patients when they reached the final stage of their lives, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
These very serious shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
For the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel, according to the health system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting a move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, without being able to take measures to alleviate their.
I fear that patients are dying simply because they have not received adequate health care.
And at the same time, several ONCOLOGIST their patients despite the worst predictions stubbornly to the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as they canceled an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin, that I will drop out of treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, they said.
However, she had told me that I was at the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have requested to die, the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish to thank after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said clearly that palliative care is not when the pain treatment.
After Elsie Monereau palliative care, head of the society of domestic palliative care of Montreal talk about 8% of patients to a pain treatment.
At the end of life, the doctors so often-terminal sedation, which amounts to the patients either einzuschläfern sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we take this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have to rely on these-terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is relieved not to say all the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want them to put me," but "I want my pain is relieved."
The realization of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.
