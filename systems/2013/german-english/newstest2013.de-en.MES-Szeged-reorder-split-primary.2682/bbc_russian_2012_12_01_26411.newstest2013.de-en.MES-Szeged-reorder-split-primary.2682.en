The proposal, the chairman of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes will be presented at the Arms Act in the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems through "attraction of the screws."
On the Internet, an open letter was published, the author, representatives of various armed groups - from the authorities want to tighten "futile."
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the Strafrechtler, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC said.

A contribution to the black market, the arms manufacturers make gem-- Baranez.
"Nowadays there are squandering countless private arms factories that will stand up in the international competition and therefore not under the hand of the weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow," the expert said.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a small-scale production, as well as their own, sometimes a mafia, who organized the smuggling," the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
