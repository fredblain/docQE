"Trademark protection in China:" if Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
In China, where it officially registered designation, nothing to do with the company.
However, as long as it enjoys protection actions, such as the actual name.
And even then it is not clear whether they will be proven right.
"It will be more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in copyright violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The copying a few additional letters enough so that they must register their trademarks.
As Lu Gucci, Prada will be simply from Gucci-Prada Kny.
German companies are also copied legally in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Patt hole opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, there was a Chinese company that trademarks protect Zegna DF Puma, a name that is also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in the copy and the injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are multistory department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
Pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his clients, he goes against Chinese companies from the trademark office officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
For women, the fishing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any debt
"This is geschäftsschädigend, you have to fight it," Patt hole.
"The brand will be diluted, the only position disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries in the millions, especially on expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company clsa China is with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third-largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But DELETION dubious entries in the commercial register are difficult to achieve and go in the money.
Up to nine years, the proceedings drag, with uncertain results.
Patt hole reported cases in which the court rejected claims, because the name is reported to the long-term "market has become a reality."
If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money, because he injured his brand in China, stalemate hole says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases involving graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer SANY, the company, which recently took over the German concrete pump Bauer Preparare master.
The bottom line is that the Chinese must now use an emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer geely -ecstasy- used a blue and white logo, which recalled BMW; the dispute was resolved, geely had to change it.
The fashion maker Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which caused the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The trademark office in Beijing CTMO admits that there were 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
In the past year, but it was returned by the "emergency situation in the workflow to normality."
So the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure was dropped by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have completed it, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, waiting in the office still 81.500 appeals to completion.
In contrast to deal
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications received by the CTMO trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record, meant that China would lead to the tenth consecutive year, the list of new registrations in all over the world, the authority.
That holds true even for the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 1.8 billion yuan had been taken on charges.
Simplified, which means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To address it costs a lot, as in the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese Plagiator.
The Germans were able to ensure that its illegal manufacturing imitation of motor vehicle parts was dug.
But he continues to be followers of the Chinese rights to the brand.
You have failed, because the family name in Germany could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical specialities says in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO rejected the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two instances of Freudenberg got it right, but the process opponents continue fighting until today.
We have to be careful award
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the process is very time-consuming, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could not quantify the company archives have even seen a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to the settlement.
"That shows how much there is," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East, even threatening to spill back to Europe.
Then, if there is imitators vulnerable brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he was able to avert the registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler award.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole Council German companies in dealings with China to be very careful.
It is not enough to international trademark rights to leave, but the fact that foreigners should "everything is worthy somehow, even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg under Chaiselongue in the last act of his trademark drama, then we would have to pay license fees for the other side's name Wentzler said.
Or we will be relegated to the segment of the market.
