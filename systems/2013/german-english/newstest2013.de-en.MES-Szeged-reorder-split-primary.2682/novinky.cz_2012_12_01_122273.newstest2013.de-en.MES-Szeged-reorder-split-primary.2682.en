"The people want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr Senator, how does one get the idea to run for the office of president?
I am not talking about being a senator or president.
If it would work in our country without problems, I would stand anywhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free, be increased during the people's taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
If I see something I don't like it, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
In the Senate, they have managed, and then straight on the road to the castle.
They will not return to their constituents back?
I said to myself the whole time that I am going to take the fight to the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later I made it and said that I shall be a candidate for the office of president, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my vision.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
But the problem is not only that we as a people shouting in the pub and in front of the television, but anyone who wants to make a difference down.
The media who want to steal the credit, and the lies to confuse the freedom of speech with freedom.
For me, it was claimed, for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant of JIRÍ Paroubek.
We are talking about their visions.
The battle for the castle you have included the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retroactive asset declarations about 20 million kronor.
To do so, you need to change the law.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the travel guide remains a free trade, and it could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, this will be rejected, and on the population.
As an independent party loser I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of any party that can do what is best for our country.
Do they see themselves as human in politics rather right or left?
From Czech perspective, it seems to me that the more people see me.
For me, this right-to-left thinking, but it is totally irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we continue to come.
I am not talking about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right; I want to unite the people.
I am always publicly any good solution, even if these KSCM or of the ODS, and I will speak out against bad ideas.
You do not like it when someone described them as populists.
But it's not confirmed by what you just said?
If you are in a company, a business plan, then you will have a great goal and a vision.
And that you want to approach.
You can call it as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world, or they have been discussed by experts.
But without support in the House, you still have only keywords.
And so, they will be in the long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you just long enough with the speeches, people will be able to push through, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
And to try to convince politicians, journalists and the general public, to bring them to our side, to achieve these goals.
As president, it is not a problem for me to call on the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television to anchor the Materialistic and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if the aforementioned would then have to say why they oppose it.
A strong personality, highlighting abuses can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, who was a credit to the public pressure.
I can say categorically that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy, I have only just begun and try to find my program for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the things themselves, and if it doesn't work, then I go in six years in the private sector.
It sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I do nothing; therefore, I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether you do not want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with radim urzdzeniach Jancura, however, rejected due to overwork.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová that uncovered the fraud in the trade, with light heating oil.
My candidacy, I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters went to the polls, not at all, and those who are gone, have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are now only two independent.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision for the direct election of mayors and district chief men.
You think about setting up your own party?
I have been thinking about that, because I don't have time to review the past every potential party member, and that it does not have the money to do so.
I have no money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000.
They have no money?
You talk about financial statements, what would your?
I value my private assets to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is about 10 million value, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a superb Škodu, about a million value. And then I still have a few million in the bank account.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he drove in a car, Galant to women and, at the same time it was fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that they want to change the Republic, but your own money, you don't want to invest in it.
This is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I do about debt?
I have already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors have shown that my program does not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will be covered basically through my salary as a senator.
But the senator salary alone, I could not live; so I could be my son, not the English school finance costs 30,000 per month.
If I wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
They are more than entrepreneurs to have their livelihoods?
They said that they will not go back to these activities?
But that is not linked to the level of salary.
As promised, I pulled my activities.
So, for example, is my deputy in the spring, managing director of the travel agencies.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan rescues the Republic.
But I must however life of something.
Monthly income on which they were used as an entrepreneur?
Some 200,000 to 400,000, and it remains so.
As President, I would put my activities, however.
