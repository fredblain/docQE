"The great and powerful leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While lawmakers and human rights activists to discuss what the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminal act with fake certificates
13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the home remaining families.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which everyone working immigrant must pass a test that certified knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to immigrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests of time, according to federal immigration authority should be for all future guest workers on duty.
It is not just language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
The bill would also exempt people who receive their education certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Meaning, and the protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the review will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of Friendship, the Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants may take the tests in all cities; now in Russia were already more than 160 appropriate center opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal immigration agency.
Human rights activists, however, said before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: what makes the whole thing?
What changes to the legislation, which must have language skills, both for the Russians as well as for guest workers?
Above all, spokesman for the immigration agency, say it is trying to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," the head of the representation of the federal immigration agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew says.
Their rights must be protected, but before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.
Migrants on problems without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future immigrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which will put him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he endure with dozens of his peers months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
Us many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home that will give you a promise, and on arrival, they are cheated, have lost their passports and not get the promised salary," the head of the General Administration of labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow confirmed.
Not complaining, boss!
Yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money, that they control not only the language of the country, but not in their own language hardly prestrilor can express.
Of course, this is not your fault, but the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only a sound basic education.
Because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager, these children and then take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Human rights activists say the law following important aspect.
The test only migrants must discard with legal status.
You do not have that status, so there is no review and no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "banned for unauthorized access."
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get in Russia, an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Also, costs the legalization of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration you can do quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are fake and we are not registered, and then resulting cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow speaks to journalists.
"Just to spare no expense for false papers."
Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some Gefaelschte certificates to certify the completion of the language tests were already beschlaggenommen by employees of federal immigration authority.
The fake papers were printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant who hoped to save the tests to be paid for the document thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this is a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be bought, both officials and civil rights activist, agreed.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers, the case for the first time by the test, only promise that you have time for a language courses.
Moreover, in areas are newcomers without language skills offered to people with no active understanding is necessary.
