In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime to justice in this country will soon be legal: the possession of a few chunks of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends on a September day with the car in Lamar, near the border with Kansas on the road when they were halted.
After the police found marijuana in the car, was summoned Orozco for possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien - excusable peccadilloes, which are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and received a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But it is also a?
Maybe in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drug offenses, less by the law than from the site.
Hundreds of regulations that are related to marijuana, and dropped in the state of Washington, which has already approved similar measures.
The police authorities are adults over 21 years for possession of a small crowd. This is legally permitted, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced plans to follow the existing marijuana offenses, and people are still quoting court.
At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains in order to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," said Daniel J. oates, the police chief in Aurora, which lies east of Denver says.
And regulators in the state of Washington to contemplate scratching their heads.
They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until December 1, 2013.
In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado in any case is ahead of most states, with regard to the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for private consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, the state is therefore good for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Authority says for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith admits that no place or system can do more to serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, the so-called I-502 enters into force on December 6, and thus represents the end point of a grey area, in which the state licensing system exists yet, but legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practice issues must be resolved in this time around, as the government target of a "reasonable access" to which resulted in inserting beeps into marijuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"It will be harder nirgendwo, a site for a licensed cannabis business to find than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group says.
On November 21, Chief oates sent his employees in Aurora, an e-mail, he said, the prosecutor would pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21 years longer, and that the police "immediately" will seek no prosecutions for these crimes.
Chief oates added that the police will continue to implement st√§dtische targets for the regulation of medical marijuana growers and drug traffickers would continue.
In Weld County in northern Colorado district prosecutor Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he has said that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana brought before the court, although many were prosecuted for other crimes.
"Our agency has the duty to pursue violations, which were at the time for crimes," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the country, shows adults for the possession of small quantities of any longer.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided, however, not all outstanding Possess procedures.
"I do not believe that I'm wasting my time in order to enforce the law until it is changing," he says.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was already clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state fostered a deep split among local officials in relation to the big, green experiment.
District prosecutors ajaru when there is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents for marijuana offences in court, the defendants and acts as a spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws.
"They have spent a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for criminal prosecution, that you can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states, such as alcohol, the small quantities of marijuana to treat, Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for the sale of legal age, you can also wait nervously on instructions from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level and continue to treat as a criminal offence.
Advocates of legalization movement in the hope that the Justice Department is going to give.
Despite several spectacular carcinogenic arrests of the consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government allows the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states, for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik advisor to the Obama administration believes that investigators will probably no doors to seize smaller quantities of drugs, however, are likely to suffer under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado are not only that the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratorium on new marijuana shops, although this could open only in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban is likely to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in a position where we license someone and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We have done, for what the community and not according to what the government has decided.
Still, many questions remain open.
