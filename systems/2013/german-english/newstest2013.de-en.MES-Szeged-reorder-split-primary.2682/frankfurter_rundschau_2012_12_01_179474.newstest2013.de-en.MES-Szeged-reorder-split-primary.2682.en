Messenger: NASA Discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that Mercury ice exist on the planet.
The ice may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are some frozen water, as evidenced by three on Thursday in the journal "Science" published studies.
The probe Messenger have found evidence that the ice sheet is in the shadow of the permanently in the region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 cm and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water came from comets or asteroids that may also have embarked on the Mercury.
Nobody put the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon said.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 2 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.

Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei began a year later to the star.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes were growing - and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows all equal in the eyes of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Canarias telescopio on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone, the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Detriment of cheap construction: the telescope is already in his elevation angle - and in his limited mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high-earning power.
This is despite relatively low - namely diameter mirror - the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers to hear it all for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, which is worthy of its name.
With its total four mirrors the telescope can also ensure its designed function within prescribed limits in the middle.
Also on the Chilean HACER Observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its main mirror to include a whopping 42 yards - and be set on nearly 1,000 mirror elements together.
With photos until 2018, however, is to be expected.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii was seen as the biggest in the world.
They offer two levels ever, with an average of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory near them, even with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on the summit of Mauna Kea to a new, huge telescope with a mirror - an average of 30 meters.
It is here on an illustration.
The main impressions from all the space telescope Hubble delivers, however.
Since April 24, 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope search for extrasolar planets, particularly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011 was announced by NASA that 1,235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission began.
In the last launch preparations are documented on the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot until 2018 aboard a Ariane5 rocket into space.
The primary mirror of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope to search for light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data, as the Messenger circles far closer to the North Pole to the planet.
Radar measurements hingedeutet have for decades that there is on the ice.
The MESSENGER probe launched in 2004 - the first, which revolves around the Mercury, the scientists have now certainty.
