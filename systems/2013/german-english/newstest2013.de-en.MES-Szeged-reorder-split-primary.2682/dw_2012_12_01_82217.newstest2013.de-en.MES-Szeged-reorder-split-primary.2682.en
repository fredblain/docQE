Szabo: "German must play a greater role."
Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine abstained.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then to Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Germany must now be given its special relationship with Israel but cautious.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, as was to set up a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, enforced by NATO.
Germany will find it difficult to take on important international issues a clear position?
Yes, it's true.
This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy from a policy, which has been managed by the United States, a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The German is therefore find themselves trapped in the middle.
It is expected that you play a more independent role, but they are not.
I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy it from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent from those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, in other words from the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have had influence on the attitude of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote at the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be cautious, the public, but also to the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, which plays a role.
But I would not want to attach a lot of weight, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in German reections.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by focusing on major decisions, abstained in the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe, and even in the US there is great sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany is a game that even some respect.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The US, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite sympathetic to the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can, of course, does not represent the position publicly.
I believe that the real differences are not always as they appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is by no means an audience of Netanyahu's policy.
Germany will find it hard to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the main partner in the EU, on the other side?
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case now.
So they can't be part of a broader line and must instead expedite things from their own position.
This is precisely the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even for the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the German clear is that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as a major international player, will play a key role in Germany at all?
Like Germany or the leadership still difficult?
Germany is still not accustomed, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time when Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German feelings.
This makes it the German.
This is the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics, from the EU fills the vacuum at the moment but not who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular, c'est la vie!
