The cause of a dying of AIDS today is a belated recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old, confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says of the moment that he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to care only about his illness and started to inform themselves; and this with such dedication that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which is difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, a few treatment options and more stigmata.
Then it became the director of a clinic of imss to adopt, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
Now, however, many people are still in the hospital, unaware of their disease and where the virus has already caused damage and your immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, after the first reported cases, "the big success today means that the survival of patients to take the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," the head of the HIV unit of the hCG, jaime Andrade Villanueva said, although he said that this information was based in April this year from a reputable scientific publication.
, an expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists inferred since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depends on the extent of the damage to the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that those who do not have a greater chance that drugs are: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a census of 500 CD4.
Simply put, mean that anyone above the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in this sense, "easily 75 years old can, as long as it is under control," he said.
In order to view this progress right, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today amounts to an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 reduced in 2011 (annual report of onusida)), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the national database collected since the release of the patients have died of AIDS.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the month of May this year are already in 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there are since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
So, why people are still dying?
I think the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no problems with the supply of medicines. The problem is that people come in far advanced state, because they know their infection status, which is not in the late stages of the disease.
He makes a compelling statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have a lifelong infection to be able to deal with the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are SUBCONTRACTOR influence, which is why all those people where it is needed, massive screening tests must be offered."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de ciudades más caras del sida en Jalisco (Coesida) to vote (the State Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio, who has carried out its test at a private laboratory, and this for the simple reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS phase and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and want to hear nothing.
"If I have to die, then three times better place," they say in my case.
The change was to improve Appui ernähre me well, I do, and I take the medication.
Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I am working, I have a lot of responsibility, but an active sex life, I'm on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio lists, which agreed to share his intimate details with Milenio Jalisco to encourage those who, with his testimony today in the context of the world AIDS day fear.
They should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group. The sooner you know whether you are HIV-positive, the better, and if you know the diagnosis, they have to learn how to live as all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizens large holes, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara that the cause of HIV has adopted.
And the most important thing is prevention.
On this particular places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased Wénjn; they were made separately, now you are giving us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The risk of new infections among young people.
"What you need the widespread derision?" Is a question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people want to get out, the correspondent said.
He proposed to orient these inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of institutions that are frequented by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
It should not be the beer and motel paid, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms should be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not; it is best that condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity exercise," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There's 13.435 cumulative cases (1.317 12.158 AIDS and HIV).
The state is in fourth place nationally and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection cases of sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2% Perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there is a case for 4 or 5 people that do not know.
