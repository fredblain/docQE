Birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with earth residents on board to find a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the important question of how we can continue our plants in weightlessness or on the planet?
There are many choices, in my opinion, no.
De facto, there are only two real planet that we could live at least hypothetical.
"Namely Mars and Venus," the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin says.
While the conditions on Mars are comparatively, there is life on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in other words, all possible.
The question of reproduction in the all the researchers treated first with regard to the flora.
Already a half-century before experiments were conducted with plants.
The fourth generation of in-orbit bred peas difference is not in the least of the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, specifically from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study the effect of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It has become a normal chicks.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chickens must stop; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," the director of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Vladimir Sychew explained.
Without a solid surface then precipitated the chicks.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and loud.
Then they died four days later.
"Twice we were hatching chicks and then the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in all.
The last breeding kennel with animals flew 16 years in orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
There are, however, will be the "only" Bion homosexual species.
It was an experiment with rats that were already sent fertilized.
In principle, was found nothing special.
"That was the bio-satellites, but again there was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," Vladimir Sychew noted.
After landing the space rats got offspring.
The issue of reproductive directly in space could not be solved before.
The task is difficult.
Animals which will travel from their natural habitat can't just follow their reproduction.
In contrast to animals in the human could in principle.
Homo sapiens is too abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women fly for 50 years.
It was the biggest risk for Tereshkova.
The most valuable asset, which owns the humanity of the female body.
The gull flew away, and no one on earth could answer the following question: survives the space flight?
They will be able to bring a child into this world?
"After all, nobody answered this question," space veteran's Watschnadse says.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan nikolajew was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which was twice in orbit, and even some work outside the space vehicle, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have only very few cosmonaut after long flights, in which everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," cosmonaut Valery Poljakow hero, hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation concludes.
And yet, humanity needs to look for new ways of biotechnology, the radiation protection and creating artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in the centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of flux the cosmonauts win routine for work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as a pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is, as the small Ichtyander would testify that life in the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get more water.
In principle, this is logical, since crime from birth to the first swimming just over two weeks.
"This is too little time to forget about something," baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa says.
While the weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman cannot happen without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness is the belly and Beckenmuskulatur enormously fast return and with the ability to squeeze the child.
Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could, for example, be held in a Spezialkammer to squeeze the child.
"But what happens then?," the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow says.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
To feel without the natural attraction, the body cannot form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in orbit to training as an adult in a suit.
It will simply be the absence, which is of vital importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment will mean that we are going to launch a behinderten, a completely unadapted people to the world," the head of the ethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Igor Pestow, predicts.
So far, the birth of children in the world all is just a theory.
At some point, but it becomes a reality, if the inhabitants of the earth to break into their space ships to a distant planet, which is a home for her in the all-born offspring.
