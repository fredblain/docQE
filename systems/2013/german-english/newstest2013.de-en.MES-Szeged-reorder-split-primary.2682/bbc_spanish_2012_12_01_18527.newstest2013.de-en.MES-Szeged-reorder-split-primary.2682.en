Singapore needs babies to rescue the economy.
The SWF's, Singapore's shifting the blame to ensure that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons yet, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as "will," Bao "(loaf in the oven), about the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun of.
The advertising agency BBH, which has video preserves the hope that the advert achieved in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of music, wanted to bring the people to perform their "national duty."
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The Fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to take care of us.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of speed-dating evenings flirting (fast).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?
1.2 children
This is not an easy issue, the Government of Singapore.
Every year there are 1,300 US dollars for political measures to encourage people to have more children.
A package of government for married couples and parents grants of up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in south-east Asia, is also on the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the SWF's, Singapore's more children?
, Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of the national population authority says that this was due to a "better training" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to marry and to form a family to have a lot more options in terms of lives and to set priorities," she said.
These changes in the social realities have to the higher number of people living alone and the delay in the marriage and birth control, which resulted in the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, led an immigration policy that aims to counter a surge in immigration, to reduce the population to resentment in the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the little laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese, which have been criticised for keeping wages low and integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher fees and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the well-known effects on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the health-care costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also showed unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that many small apartments are being built.
So does have an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, the concern is that they can support the lifestyle of the people living alone, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large housing for families.
However, Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company Destac√≥ Developers says that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger units.
This means that they are for our cash flow much better.
He admits, however, that the new standards would give developers clearer guidelines, which had previously been placed obstacles in the way, if you build too many small units in a project.
Too much stress.
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if the new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate, is in talks with the Singapurern who work in the financial district, that it will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed that housing and education are expensive, so it will be delayed by many," a young manager says.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," another, about 20-year-old man says.
Men and women have their career, the stress and the cost of the property and education as the reasons for this is that you cannot have children.
That is why the SWF's, Singapore's the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much.
