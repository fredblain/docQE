Prostate cancer screening test: should be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes with false negative results, INACCURATE or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to greater hesitation previously undecided men for the implementation of early detection tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have asked for the opinion of two doctors.
The studies conducted in the United States were many confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe came to the conclusion that there is a big difference in mortality rates of patients with and without detection.
This study has shown that the likelihood of metastasized around 30 to 40% is a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years later, when no early detection was carried out.
I therefore commend the test from the age of 50 years ago or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, which was already ill with prostate cancer.
In men, African-American origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as the cancer was detected.
There are cancers that others who are aggressive and indolent.
The patient must be the extent of his cancer risk really understood to be made by the possible options, showed him where Prostatakrebse can remain untouched, if it affects the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases, rather than an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, which we did not detect cancer treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
We certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated, and who is not.
I therefore commend the implementation of the test.
But the most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be executed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society for urology Movember has developed a tool with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of the PSA tests.

Prevention of the disease.
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress of research is the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and will be sufficient.
"If there were no smoking more, this value would rise at least 50%," Andr- Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society said.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society of the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," the spokesman Andr- Beaulieu Deplores.
Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, reduced the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also support the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, Grimmdarm, pancreatic, oesophageal Mastdarm, and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, it increases the risk of contracting a Grimm or broiler colon cancer.
Sausages should be avoided.
The preservation of meat, smoked, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins.
In recent years, several scientists examined the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their investigations are currently do not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
During a study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D also revealed the cancer was not yet clear.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu stressed how important it is to talk with their doctor about his concerns and his family England.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
