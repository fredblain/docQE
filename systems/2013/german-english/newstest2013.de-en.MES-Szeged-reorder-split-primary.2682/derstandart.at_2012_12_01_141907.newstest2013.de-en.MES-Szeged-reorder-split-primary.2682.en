The architects MVRDV proof that the real adventure, not only in the head - for example spijkenisse and the newly-created "- 2 photos
"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see them again," said Lisette Verhaig Passantin says, on the edge of the road.
And, Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby major operating says: "it is beautiful, but already, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man is still at one of these old-style libraries, or?
Spijkenisse tiesnavou needy Sleepingbag, a little town on the outskirts of Rotterdam, strange record holder.
The 80,000 residents' education has the lowest rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid, we decided a few years ago, contribute to the general education and to reduce the seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro, seem pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the education campaign.
And so the city fathers recognized that there is only one way to be the statistic Mr: a library needs.
, winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of the great bold bar graphs and producer of funny, often cynical buildings took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared to the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under my arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury still looked puzzled and shoulders, wincing Esspecially Freche Maas of his exquisite gifts to the size of a pyramid and founded an actionist ended his speech with the words: "dear municipality."
It is, therefore, my proposal for the mountain of books spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million mountain is built up.
He is part of a revitalization project, including garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few are living and adjacent row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, "the second prize was awarded the" Best Library of NL 2012. "
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
So the faceless town retort that offer had not so far more than a post-modern peša and a stunned ugly Hall, behind its white walls, one could be inclined to suspect a Molkereifabrik, a piece of contemporary architecture is richer.
Above all, however, has now spijkenisse on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book.
The first impression: books Eldorado under glass.
It is true that there is an elevator that leads through the mountains, but the real joy and read the fußläufigen climb up the topography.
The Rundum glazed interior is bright and clear, and the elegant streetlights burned Klinkerboden unequivocally speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for park bench, dog and soccer-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle of a large, dark space, which is usually ugly and impersonal is winy Maas says."
We have asked the classic room configuration on its head and read by enclosing the area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the books: this is used in the middle office, library, the Internet Chess Club, environmental and clean house.
A special treat is the black bookshelves, time, time parapet wall Cowling, rose close countries.
Look, feel and smell.
Even hardbitten architects, engineers and construction material and the unknown whether shake of the head.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality spijkenisse said, at the request of the standard.
And so we have encountered in a farming friesländischen one day on a waste product from agriculture.
For many years we have used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a Milli meters thin plastic woven as the root surface.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin KROME- holds a two seasons, then it is ripe for the rubbish bins.
For the library the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities to four inches thick plates.
Under heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that smells a little after new cars and a little after athletic footwear.
After 105 stufen has reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journeys in the cafe will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in the literature Mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this is in spite of the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says.
Heated and chilled with geothermal energy.
Although the books mountain is under a glass of fall, the sun itself appears only briefly on sunny days in the interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder available across the glass facade, serve as shadows and catch a large part of the sun's rays.
The climate is very pleasant.
The rest fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry already ventured into the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM Cynthia Bogarde, which she described as "the Boekenberg Spijkenisses overdue soul."
The reason: the opening a few weeks every resident has been invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the time being, so that should be filled again the optical gaps in the not-yet-fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has taken root.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," architect winy Maas says.
"I think that thanks to our invitation each now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
This is the pinnacle of Menyelisihi MVRDV who are called in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse has literary history.
So young and uneducated they may be.
This is a starting point for identity.
