"The brain can outwit Haemochromatosis only so far."
The supporters of modern technologies popular topic of augmented reality is perceived in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first showcased in the summer at its annual conference a working model, in November, was then known that Microsoft had applied for a patent.
In the interview with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram izadi, is clear, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
It makes it possible to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual space.
- you just please describe their research group, which operates.
- we are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, want to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, the race is largely stuck in the phase that work with pixels on flat screens, which sometimes.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and predict the radical changes this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console generation sensors and a step forward, and today is sold without any Xbox generation, since all the interested in motion control.
- what awaits us in the future?
The new generation - although the interaction on a physical level, much is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been decided.
We are trying to change that work on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We must let the computer world in our physical world and make them more intelligible.
It is not only necessary but that the user, but also its surroundings.
Then we could add to the real world much easier by virtual objects.
First and foremost we should be Conserva bescheuerten virtual reality helmets.
- what do you think about language control?
It is popular, but it is not overvalued?
- it is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions of privacy, because it is not always inform all others about his actions and intentions.
Virtually every kind of interaction with computers, but each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the area of control of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and tight, experimenting with sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but from a bracelet Registerd the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively high, but in theory could be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
But, on the whole, however, the future belongs to the joint management types, for example, gestures and language.
- like that?
- we would ask me, for example, to offer these Sprudeldose?
They say it and at the same time Deuten.
- Normally I say it simply.
- oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- that is, they want the user adapts to what can make a machine at the time and what is not?
- not necessarily, but there is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we need to be working in the next time, especially in the development of new types of sensors that allow it to collect comments from people.
For example, laser sensors in depth because they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
- which claims it from its work with the Xbox generation sensors on modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, deep or something else?
The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8-megapixel with a speed of 1000 fps were not bad.
But the main thing is not the pipeline itself, but the quality and the depth of the matrix.
So are all current technologies are not good enough, because the developers of the algorithms more work.
It must not only the resolution along the X and the Y, but also along the z-axis are taken into account.
The speed and the number of frames per second are important.
The movements of the people are very dynamic and open are the current 30 fps especially for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a lot by now with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touching control and with more frames per second.
- the number of cameras should not be increased?
The new generation - is currently working with three cameras, "one of them, in fact, and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object deep.
More cameras could solve the problem...
Or the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful generation would be a flexible, similar to the system in which we could play with various kamera tendencies to see how that helps us in the three-dimensional investigation of a position.
- if I remember correctly, Microsoft in contrast to Google his glasses, not the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality glasses on a daily basis, the best prospects?
Of course, it is not pleasant to stop a smartphone in the hand, but I think the neatest variant would be a "temporary" extended reality, in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone,
The lens is a personal gadget, and therein lies its strength (private can only see it), but also its weakness, because an enlarged reality through glasses prevented that they can work together with other virtual objects.
- let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortals.
There is a problem, pointing to the critics of this idea: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing!
What answers your group wants to be at this point?
I am in my lectures often assume that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is the use of second-hand as something unusual projection surface.
It takes pressure.
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" something tangible, for example the interference of some grassroots ultrasound beams at a certain point, where the finger is located, a feeling, but at the moment there is, as someone who created these fallen over the knuckles.
There are tapes for the wrist, which affect the Nervenendungen in the fingers, it is also a potential direction.
- you have tried to outfox the brain?
Thinking that it feels it what it should be, if it sees something?
- it is a good idea, so we tried it yet.
Here is another issue we will have to fight for a long time, namely, a man who is physically in a closed room to believe, he instead in an open, virtually infinite space; we have been working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms, as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only dream, and we still have many years of work.
That is the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive: for researchers on many issues, we are only at the beginning.
