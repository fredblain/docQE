Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but all over the world.
The secret to the success of the country might have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of mature cheeses.
One place you in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sports clothing.
And they leave a week.
As it is the smell of rakfisk nasenbetäubenden, one of the great delights of Norway.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which is fermented, it depends on how you would like to stink its fish - up to a year in water.
When the darkness comes in Norway on the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians to flock here in Fagernes, it is this, well, really very impressive specialty.
"You can eat it raw and provides it with a glass of aquavit," Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "rakfisk General" organized the festival says.
All around us people eat small fish cubes and make large quantities of alcohol.
"People don't like the Mansche aquavit more than the rakfisk," Harvard said.
The spirits can replace the smell.
I eat a few bites.
If it avoids the rakfisk CROPANI in nose, he is not a bad thing - such as sushi, quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cool and wet fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In the depths of winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and then - no doubt aided by alcohol subdued senses - consumed.
A generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians forced in search of work, to leave their country and immigrated mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, drawn by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, which was not too long ago, much richer than Norway, ieceotaji flows.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strict smelling part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway is not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere.
Here hates it still Anders Breivik, to name names - those racist right-wing extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children.
Instead, referred only to the "incident on July 22."
Norwegians do find it difficult to accept that someone is in their peace-loving country to such brutal killings.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway has been around since the early 1970's growth is one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," Anna, our waitress who Cuocere round trays with seasoned rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal says.
We are a - as they say - prudent people.
Her English is like that of most people here.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not emerge.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very careful - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.
As with all money raised in the years leading up to the world economic crisis, which they had not, Norway gave his wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And, of course, rakfisk Easting," she adds with light-hearted laugh.
I am in the snow and instead on another court - from rakfisk I have enough.
As a moose burgers is definitely something I enjoy. The juicy meat.
But in the evening, the stinky fish on the menu.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several locations that can organize a rakfisk dinner, guests in the best sense of smell - or perhaps the most challenging - Ospreys votes.
There is a live TV circuit with a fly-shirted show master, which is surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What number you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"
Here are our points, "Harvard."
They applauded and laughed.
A man falls overwhelmed by his chair, possibly from the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the tough reality of the whole fish.
