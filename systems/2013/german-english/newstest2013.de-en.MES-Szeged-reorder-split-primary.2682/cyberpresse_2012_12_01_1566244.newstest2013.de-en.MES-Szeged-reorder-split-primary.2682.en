Analyzing the Higgs boson
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs bosons last summer, has caused a stir, and for good reason.
It is believed that this only is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And, finally, is the last particle whose existence was of the standard model - our best, or at the very least "false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but observed empirically or not.
But for the physicist, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particles, and that it is predicted by the Standard Model Higgs boson.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week on a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data in order to be completely safe.
However, we believe that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we look at what is at stake.
In a world where there is inevitably a crucial law, which means that two objects cannot be at the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and you try not to because they will hurt themselves.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law for you: 'the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "elementary," while the "state" is, by and large, from some of their properties.
Assuming the physicist, a part of the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione Ina and obey the principle.
And in another move the bosons, a gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, certainly not this principle, which means that they are in fact at the same time in the same place.
These bosons itself, according to the Web site The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is) absolutely amazing into two groups: the decay that we will not treat here and the "power" through which the great forces of nature and spread the Higgs boson, which would be used in any way.
It must be emphasised, however, that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a bosons of exceptional banality: the Photon or "light particles," which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a speeding Particules with an electric charge or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field at precisely this place "disturbed," like a pebble, who was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbing" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "of power."
More stable Militara
The same is true for the Higgs boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs field, should "be disturbed" that this only shows.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energy, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could be zerfurcht only by a very large rocks.
Therefore, a giant particle accelerator as CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, would never be a sheet of paper on the refrigerator.
And not all particles interacting with the Higgs field: those that do have a degree, while the other (such as the photon) have no mass.
For what can all this research is now "well," said Mrs Plamondon asks?
For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they will enable physicists to investigate all the differences between the observations and predictions of SM.
There are, in fact, a number of physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has some serious shortcomings, because it offers no explanation for the gravity (UPS!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe, UPS (again!).
However, at CERN such exemptions were not found until now.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories not suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution.
You saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, developed in 1962, and even the first time line were the first laser gepulst) - has already said that the laser was seen at the beginning rather than a "laboratory gimmick."
Imagine...
In addition to applications from all the instruments that surrounded the research.
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle Rih√°k has developed during his work at a small room.
Although it was not the original purpose, serves this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" in 2009 and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that we can never really know...
