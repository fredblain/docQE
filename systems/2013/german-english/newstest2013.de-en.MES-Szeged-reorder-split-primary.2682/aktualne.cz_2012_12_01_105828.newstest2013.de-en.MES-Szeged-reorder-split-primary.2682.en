Nkú chief: control of the Black system failed due to the fault of the policy.
The Czech Republic has in connection with public contracts on good control bodies and adequate laws, however, is in its application.
In the interview for Aktuálne.cz Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úrad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala says so.
"A law is never completely, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that this is not the case," Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar outcome is also seems to be a common control by Czech and German investigators.
The practice as a negative example he brings the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Necas to the so-called "black system."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass the entrepreneurs with controls - the system now is banned or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, but the government does not come easy chair, and hinder the Control Board, whose duty is to control the application of the law is, in his work," said Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other.
What was it?
It is a parallel review we started about two years ago.
Put simply, is that the European legislative determines how to handle public contracts to build the national legislations. And finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this, we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, are the laws we are perhaps even more "rigorous and perfect," but the actual application in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to create new and more detailed rules. You must also deal with the actual implementation of the law.
How can you help the project? What emerges from this project?
Such a joint control could help that we constantly strive to improve laws and the lowering of thresholds and rebalancing if this obviously is not very positive.
Economic means to purchase one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and to exclude illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be that we put the system in this way only with excessive "paperwork," and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher.
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
What the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the Federal Audit NKÚ, which is similar to us and also has a college, which is basically just a little different but work both authorities.
The powers are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is, however, a federal state, which means that there are these courts in individual states - that is the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only monitor federal funding, which is our state funds.
Public funds that are managed in the counties and municipalities, control of the country's courts are there.
What the German legislation, is easier than ours?
In general, I would compare this without specific information only ungern. Nevertheless Germany is, in some ways, often referred to as a model, but you cannot say that Germany is better.
The fact that the inspectors are better?
That is not, but as I said, I don't like comparisons.
This is to say that even those countries that are a model for us, will also have to deal with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, isn't it?
What the Czech legislation, which was important for their authority, the revision of public procurement law, you already feel any impact?
Given that this novel is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests.
Since our controls are in place, you have to expect a certain delay.
We feel so far more impact in preparation for future inspections, so we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and examined with this nearly 14,000 public contracts and analyzed - here are the changes impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of calls were MODIFIES.
You can see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with another layer of bureaucracy?
I think that this bill is a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, it may occur, the problem is that the rules are "strict" and can no longer be respected.
Under the previous rules are a Proofreading unterzogenen people against the winner (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council accountable, so that any breach of contract law is tantamount to violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it useful, however, to make the law even tougher?
I do not believe that in this way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack the system and abuse, and not punish those who committed an error that has an impact on the real decision-making.
Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
First, let's say, what is not.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother with the controls of the so-called "black" - what exactly does this mean?
The black system has now been banned or allowed?
A bill must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, but the government does not come easy chair, and hinder the Control Board, whose duty is to control the application of the law is, in his work.
He said: "we can change the law and allow the matter," but he could not say that we behave as if nothing would.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid will be excluded solely because of procedural irregularities.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied right - and that is what is missing from us, I think.
