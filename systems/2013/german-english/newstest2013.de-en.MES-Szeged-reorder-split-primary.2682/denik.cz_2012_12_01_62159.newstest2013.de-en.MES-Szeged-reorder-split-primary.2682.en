Šimon Ornest: on our concerts we want to build up positive energy.
What do you think that the world should take place in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster messages that we are so happy to jump to humans.
With our band The tap tap we make us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or to prevent the world.
In December, they also create a unique project with three concerts against the world.
You can imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we plan to two years.
We want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for the 21st December at 11: 10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, from 9: 00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends.
This idea came from whom?
Originally from me, then we have to flesh out the idea, together with our graficdesigner Honza Augusta.
We don't want to just collect sufficient positive energy to prevent the world, but we like to think along with the public about the state of the world once we pass on to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the world, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can also support.
The band The tap tap has taken together with other performers also called the anthem against the world with the title "doomsday is."
Even today, the national anthem on YouTube is very popular. It will be performed at the charity concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything goes according to plan, and the world is not taking place...
The anthem should be sung by all the performers on all three concerts at the same time.
Also, the hymns are -bertragen together in a direct circuit of the Czech television live.
The text of the anthem of the company HANÁK, who also played the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also sings with Xindl X...
How did you get to work with two?
We will also cooperate with other leading figures in the Czech culture scene, that we realize many charity events and concerts.
We are trying to involve us, these people in our projects.
It was clear that the majority of them are interested in cooperation with us, and have fun.
The purpose of the proceeds from the concerts will benefit against the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre.This Studeo, we are already working six years together with the tap in the jedlicka Institute.
The students of jedlicka Institute will be cared for by editors that help you with various leisure activities.
Since the students do not have the resources to search for the editors, we want to help you in this way.
In the context of the completion of the jedlicka Institute, a private building in which we draw with this project.
At every concert a number of groups and performers.
According to what criteria they have chosen this?
We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, China ucitelé, support lesbiens, Illustratosphere occur with Dan Czech, the tap tap, Marián Bango and JIRÍ Suchý.
Everything else you can find on the internet page www.kpks.cz.
Similar "big events" are also planned for the future?
In May, we stand for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to join in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States, this would also like to combine with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans are not just small, thus far, they have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The TAP is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
As they deal with this logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. We must also, of course, with many instrument suitcases and other Lugage...
Nonetheless, it has always worked without problems, CSA and British Airways have always been very good to us that sometimes I wonder sometimes.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By their foreign travel, so you have a comparison, as it did in the individual countries with accessibility looks, how to deal with people with disabilities
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than us, we were just in Russia that witnesses in the East is still in its infancy.
Vis-à-vis Prague Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even there, of course, is that it leaves a wheelchair user, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are clubs that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things on which we depend is...
It is important to note, however, that an improvement in the situation still depends on the efforts of the people affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities move independently in a public space, the museum can use toilets, etc.
But it is not customary for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in the public arena, we are involved with the band The Tap Tap are slightly ahead of the West.
In respect of the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when the great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks, things will really start to change.
So far, these are only cases of particular desire strong personalities.
The TAP is currently very popular. But if we take a couple of years back: what was your motivation in 1998 to start a band?
Then I started as a supervisor in the jedlicka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something.
And since I am a musician and saxophone games I founded together with a colleague, a music AG.
Oh, and by the time is that, as our moderator to say láa Angelovic, tended to get a little out of control (laughs).
The band was known, but only in the last few years, and I am wrong?
It is true that the cooperation helped with well-known singers; we also have also begun to advertise for us.
We become aware that if you are doing something and to the outside, this is not your performance in a way that does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding we can afford überdies good editors, high-tech equipment and gapahuk.
It was their goal, with the tap tap so far?
From the beginning, I have sensed the potential that we can go about things differently.
Show business is now often copied one another.
That is on its way, because everything Logicamente new is viewed with caution and accepted until some time later.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of the audience usually is, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because no lonely and abandoned Przemyslowego are people with disabilities, and we would regret.
There are people who can live a normal life and develop, if you have the funds to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities does something, this is not just for themselves, but for the whole society.
It was for this success, that you are a strong leader, as we hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise on many things, and also needs a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you then have to find that they have tested twice a week, to undertake preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then quickly extinguished the enthusiasm among many.
So it works but everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
Tap tap Receptionisten currently has 20 members.
How many of those were from the outset, since 1998?
Only one: láa Angelovic.
We are an open group. The people come and go, but this is something we cannot avoid.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.
