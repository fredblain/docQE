A Republican strategy to confront the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policy with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter as a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States, as the number of people killed by lightning.
The attorneys for the Republicans have seen in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of election fraud.
One thing is certain: these new rules will adversely affect the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the federal states for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments announced since 2009, new laws that make it difficult for the process for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has won after the elections of November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives were able to be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011, which restrict the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws that require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also will be shortened by the time frames for the early vote, declared the law invalid, to register as voters on election day, and denying citizens the right to vote, for which a court acts.
Before the elections of 2006 has to show no US government demanded by the voters, photo identification.
Indiana was the first state that has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.
Over the last two years before they helped to draft legislation in 34 states, with which the voters will be forced, photo identification.
It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal identification card as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters who do not have their own state authority of a government issued picture identification.
In addition, five million new voters in the 2012 does not have such a card.
However, often paying more than a hundred dollars to obtain the necessary papers.
The new restrictions on young people, minorities and low-income people are affected disproportionately.
In fact, with 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification.
This goes further.
The students, who are seen as voters who cast their ballots for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not permitted to use their of their establishment issued photo identification.
On the other hand, allow same states choose members of fishing and hunting clubs, the more on the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
In 2004, a federal state asked for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state created such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures aim clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states laws promoted, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
Furthermore, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the registration of voters in the general election in 2004 to register some 10 million citizens.
Because of the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%.
Moreover, the Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed to shorten the period for the early vote.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the White, which constitute 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate, voted in advance.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters vehemently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states passed laws that require the flagship of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim of influencing the results in the decisive state for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that this legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will adversely affect the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
