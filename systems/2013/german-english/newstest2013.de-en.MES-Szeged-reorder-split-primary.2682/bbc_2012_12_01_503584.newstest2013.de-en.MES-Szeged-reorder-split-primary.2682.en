Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration will grant analyzed by the BBC, the challenges facing him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel, which was sealed off several important transport routes in the capital and chaos in the streets.
The goal, however, it was not to interfere with commuter on the way to work, but also to prevent demonstrators trying to reach the parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Präsidentenbinde and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon, Mexico can prove economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has claimed in the past six years, as many as 60,000 lives.
"My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office, the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this goal.
Before he went with the US president at eye level, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided over the new head of state.
A direct Nalezy
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo reminds you, for example, to him.
Residents of the resort to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on the highways, Pena Nieto, construction and pose a major improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that were once here.
With his name plaques hanging outside of a modern sports centre and a spectacular interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect from him real and lasting change," his friend and political ally LAX Gabriel Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party, the PRI's Pena Nietos.
In particular, with regard to the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman LAX admits that the party after 12 years of the capture of the Presidential Palace outside of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
Subsequently, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast could not be on the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo.
The town lies hidden under highway bridges and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military has been switched to combat the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a dirt wasteland near a large garbage dump the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been killed in the last two years left.
During the administration of Governor Pena Nieto Mexico were in the state killed about 1,000 women - a statistic that surpasses even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is for the violence and the killings of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is dealing with the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least not appropriate.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the rundown district, is fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as she showed me photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of events in 2010, according to Mariana committed suicide.
But her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that they had been beaten, and the body rigid had already used.
While her mother tells her story, an image of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is right next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, you have until now refused.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a humbug, troublemakers, whingers.
You want to accept their verdict and the mouth.
"But this is not possible, if there were so many flaws and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto, on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde, he also has a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to take care during his tenure, especially around this problem.
"I hope that as president, he is, as he was as governor," the congressman císla LAX in Valle del Bravo says.
But that is exactly what fear the families of the victims in Ciudad neza most.
