A constitution with the sledgehammer in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains divided on the constitutional declaration, the authority granted unrestricted Provisionally, more than ever, he has decided to go for broke.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly the next day will pass its final version.
Just a week before the head of state had given to this House two additional months for the conclusion of his work.
Egypt is now for nearly two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and a legal muddle.
This new initiative has provided only for an even greater divisions in the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," he continued, "by breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the part of his supporters can rest assured that there is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time, the brothers forced to abandon its plan to explain the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president is to find a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, during the protest rages across the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the US weekly Time Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor.
Since the Egyptian people with this back on a hasty vote is an ultimatum: "either vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly to an end.
85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly approved the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has fulfilled the request.
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned away, because they believe that they have not been able to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or the society acted alike.
To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, deputy members, it added.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were approved unanimously.
The commentators also found it amusing that the only difference of the day is the time for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the pendulum clock the Constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, attracted all the attention, identical to that of the constitution of 1971 and says that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement had hoped, "the principles" by the rules "to replace what made a stricter application was possible.
For the Islamists, is the fact that this article was not changed, a demonstration of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" liberals say that have seen only as propaganda.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is based on other items.
They have been especially Article 220 in the eye, which recognises the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly with regard to verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie pommier this is worrying, because the people who will be asked to give its opinion, "are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals are also fed by the fact that the next chancellor of the university may be far less moderate than the present.
"At this moment is to identify any specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, are not ulema, but academics who have been trained on the part of the French system, "Alexis Blouet, who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition appeased.
But he concedes that "220 can be available in relation to the article an ambiguity, as are the terms used by the religious vocabulary.
It is here, in particular, the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of whether civil judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday will severely criticized because of the far-reaching powers he has given the president of the republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that they are compared with the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but a national defense council.
There will also be a ban on civil procedure in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter with also share their fears in the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right of free expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President yesterday evening on television saying something, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of head of state are on the march Saturday.
