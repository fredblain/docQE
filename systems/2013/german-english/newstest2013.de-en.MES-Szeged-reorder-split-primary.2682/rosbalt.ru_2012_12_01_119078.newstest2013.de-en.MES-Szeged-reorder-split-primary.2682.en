My own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde," which is dedicated to city residents who form the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the elite list already landed high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene that go beyond the borders of the city, and are often recognition in Europe without being in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of the extravagant artists Rosbalt Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded, dressed in red, the one time at the Russian Museum, the summer garden, a time when scene meetings or at openings.
Wherever issued the images of Kirill Miller, attracting large crowds.
Kirill Miller has created one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists, the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures up by his presence on the road to his fellow citizens in the face and a smile at you for good mood.
He recently grabbed a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg, summertime for difficult role in terms of his life, his philosophy and his image finally felt ready.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
The company calls anything that deviates from the norm, Greyboard aggression and bad behavior.
I want to get through my provocations with the people in the conversation.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the meeting.
- When Did you know that you have to become a painter?
- at an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Newskij, my work was issued.
I realized that I have to go down this road.
Then the time of old-free, but not officially recognised Dolmu then went to an end, and new and free Dolmu as I was incomprehensible.
I am friends with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; the result was "Rachmaninow" and then once was.
It takes me to the theater to the fashion, music, except for all the literature.
- all united in your kind clinic... - it was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best new artist should gather.
In 1995, I took a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and then there were up to the renovation, a club for artistic Musikalisch Boheme, the House of Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: name., tequilajazzz, and I remember how string with his project "Ucho -Van Goga."
Cord and his friends sang simple songs to the play-back, wore tight shirts and also the hottest composer Igor Wdowin today.
As the group began to play live, was from her "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the fundamentals he learned from us.
Even the gallery "d 137" or the club "griboedov" have their origin in the Art Clinic.
There, our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, there have been in the press, a poll, when it came to the award "personalities of our city."
I won in the category of "artist of the year," and I have reached the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times, according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In today's world it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, to make a cultural contribution.
- your work have a distinct style.
- many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly the accuracy and clarity of thought.
I will have an exhibition with the theme of "the Russian Museum as clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be so.
In a clown that blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world by writing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone looks at the clothes and focuses on the outside, not the inside of the people.
But perhaps we should not give people a hand, but should he spit in the face.
The deception will disappear by the disguise.
Recently, we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- commercial art can also be beautiful?
Today, commercial art should be careful and considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
In the past, people were large groups: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to all.
I am not one hundred dollar note, which falls each.
Now you need to consider thee, whom thou shalt case.
Now, every cult star about 100 supporters.
- to the performances of Stas Michailow Vollkommen but several thousand!
- to women who have abandoned him sexually, the social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted these pictures, which hung in a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images, which are usually only at the end of their careers.
Today, there are often Misunderstanding.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty rejected time and money.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill, what is lacking Petersburg?
- good cultural experts.
They say: servant of the culture.
But not all of you can deal with culture.
The real Tzars, it was different, because the Tzars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what that might be, but experts will be blocked the way, as it requires hochrangigerer experts to assess the former right and you open the way.
Now only one's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that you have to say that they do not all contemporary art and some other museums therefore Dolmu.
- What is for you Petersburg?
Petersburg - is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones art can only grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers and readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many people who are curious - the exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art needs to be modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants, the city of St. Petersburg
