Guidelines for inflating of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com calls out of an annual survey on the oddest of bank charges, has decided this year to hold the competition "absurd Pengguna regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"On this idea brought us the recently by the European Union's plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of the large European companies," Patrik, who cares about the history of the organisation of the poll, told the newspaper právo.
Among the nominees absurdities, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, the women with life-insurance companies an advantage, because they represent for the insurance companies objectively less risk.
"More incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said history.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol fuel, which is in its wake, naturschädigend FUTHERMORE banning the reliable mercury thermometers, just because they have a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive to the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even a ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long.
The EU decides apparatus under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule will be represented by one or several member countries (Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to veto threat with the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas the highest trade in the EU must be at least 14 inches long and no "curvature anomaly" must have.
The European Commission defended themselves with the argument that they harmonisiere only the fragmented national standards that would impede the trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries already with the suggestion that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation of the past year, according to balloons on sale will be equipped with the note that children under eight years are not allowed to inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU berief to an American study, the balloons are the leading cause of death for the suffocation deaths of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also some odd ideas at home.
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official function in the EU must not be used because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, the name Macedonia and must instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) say.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU set the Hoechstvolumen on food supplies, which was located on the day of our EU accession on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the volume for canned mushrooms, a large fine Wofür hanging over us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive the money that they have no sea, or from the idea to provide funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are still at a disadvantage that we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU refund, "said in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
He argued that the grain harvest was very high and overcrowded government camps as a result of the so-called intervention purchases goods.
Since the Czech Republic is another way to sea ports, according to the heart of the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far, that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding offered the communities of the Ministry of Regional Development, under the leadership of Prime Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU) and, in particular, should be earmarked for the establishment of aid money to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are in the member countries, the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and deserves this efficiency and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, more recognition.
A more serious problem is the opinion of experts tend the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, which were imposed in the budget negotiations by individual member countries.
Emotions aroused by the fact that in Germany, the Czech Republic, similar to other member countries in Brussels must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic was able to defend, under a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "olomoucké tvaružky," the national rum (Tuzemský rum), which in our tradition goes back to the 19th century, our manufacturers have had to rename, however, in "Tuzemák."
The name rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of the EU's registered products of Karlovy Vary, biscuits and carp from pohorelice Trebon, or even more hops in the company of the world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or prosciutto di Parma.
With an EU trademark can because the Pardubicer gingerbread or Horicer breasts roles.
