The word "human rights" in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo, it seems, the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution with Sharia basis is controversial.
Egyptian President division with pathos.
We must make the transition.
"And that he will succeed is in my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all people, but especially to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.
So far, because they all hopelessly divided opposition in a confused, scared.
Fear of a god of the Nile State of Grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said Mohammed Morsi, almost excuse, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed his powers and extended to "save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD in American University of Southern California, really wants to save, as the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles, which were pushed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a late-night, 15-hour Parforceritt, some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also stated in the draft, the legal grounds on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will exploit the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least one new hinzugeführter Articels: in all matters relating the Sharia al-Azhar University, must be taken into account, the country's main Islamic institution with great power throughout the Sunni Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that the clergy, oversees the legislation, which de facto the disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule on the suppression of opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The state should also protect, it says in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote their morals and values. "
The law is so vague that state institutions could control with the help of this article, even the content of film art and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
No way, says the article menioneaz equality between men and women.
It prohibits another to insult the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy or to slander.
But what is an insult and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Equally dubious about the wording of the "insult to the people" is forbidden.
There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Open to interpretation, like so much in the draft, which Morsi will be put to the signature and presented to his words "very soon" the Egyptians to the referendum.
"The revolution has returned."
The opposition formed for weeks about the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the Charter to fall, even before it can enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," Hamdin Sabbahi Drittplatzierter, said of the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution "belong on the scrapheap of history."
Via short message service Twitter he accused supporters of Morsi's trying to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," the opposition persuade Yasser Said said.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brethren atoned is not yet," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Khaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they want to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to the counter-demonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the Nile River in Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis attended and shouting: "the people calling for the application of God's law."
They demanded by Morsi: "cleanse the country!" And protested: "the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for control of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, probably would have led to civil war.
Did not want to risk obviously Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft EU constitution as well as the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to be decided, the people at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
The word "human rights does not happen again."
Hafez Abu Saeda is said to be furious about this forced constitutional process that would actually have until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers, as they sat under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but for him because human rights are indivisible.
He was convicted, imprisoned, beaten.
"Now is not the word of human rights in the new constitution," he complained in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
Morsi power to extend all three powers in the state's lawyer had resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president put it," de facto suspended Saeda complained.
But without a democratic civil society organisations could not work.
Saeda feels alone, but also by the international community, which sees the ideological direction fight along the Nile, with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
A protestor in Tahrir warns: "your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."
