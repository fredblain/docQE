Poland and the space.
Last week Poland was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the twentieth member of this space agency. Poland is the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years several ESA projects.
Poland's path to space began much earlier, however.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts in the space, but they were not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Academy, where the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "entrance to the Space Exploration."
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience cold, however, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "at the entrance to the Space Exploration" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie Andr- Louis Hirsch and donated Prix rep Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of space was honored by the fact that one of the crater was named on the side of the moon erdabgewandten after him.
In 1925, a rail trolley was built in Poland, for a rocket propulsion was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project, remained unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the missile would be used to start or stop the trolley.
The details come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish Outpour began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research, the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia resulted in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents that the research was reached in the stage of practical tests.
The research, however, has been suspended by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the ING appeared in the press Rohozinski. On the draft of a photoelectric hunting missile, and the following year was the work of "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna Aquest rakietobomba be the author's" Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealing with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects have been coordinated with the military use of missile technology from the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, but his work was finished by the start of the war.
Other items to the space appear after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is in 1954 in the November issue of the journal problemy, in the four major articles of the space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of an aerospace company.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.
At its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA sought accession to the 1951-based International Federation for space, and indeed the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956 full member.
The following year the first PTA, presiding omnicki Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) was, vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA was instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1 was completed in 1957, the first flight took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A, was built in 1959, and flight tests began in the Bledowska Desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 meters long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should be in a position to make real scientific work - the missile RM-34 should at an altitude of up to 14.5 km and reach for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, the further development has been discontinued.
In the first missiles of the type RM Meteor 1 missile was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as Zweistufenrakete, their total length fraud 510 cm and start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1b and -1c) which differed from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The meteor 1A rocket had a room with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1b about 0.34 liters and meteor-1C about 0.62 per litre.
The maximum altitude fraud in all three types, 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 missile was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Also worthy of the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland participated in the framework of the programme Interkosmos space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was second after the Czechs Vladimír Conditii Interkosmonaut.
