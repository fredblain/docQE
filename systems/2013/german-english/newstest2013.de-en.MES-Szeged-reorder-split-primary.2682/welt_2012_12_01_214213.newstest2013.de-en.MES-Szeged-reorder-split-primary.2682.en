A search in the country in the 97-year-old are still relatively young.
The trip through the mountains Talysch is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumpelt on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farm houses.
Everything is green and lush, one might think, you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of the border with Azerbaijan, Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, is not much, except that she speaks perfect English and Aserisch and is very durable.
Final stop is Lerik.
The small town flaunts powerfully to meeting the architecture of Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here to tread the directions from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku.
Of the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the vehicle to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the Eurovision song festival - and in the next year, we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only player in the world.
The Vita is about eight dozen Talyschen documented from the area, the older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years ago shows a child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov that should have become 169 years old.
However, there is a birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, pluca Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.
"It was born here in the region," he died in 1973, Fatulayeva explained.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years shows he is said to have a daughter.
Irali Müslümov has charged that at his age for a couple of decades?
But even Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"Striking many hochaltrige people is also available in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "also in Sardinia life extremely many very old men."
Due to a lack of documentation was, however, no scientific proof of age, identity register.
Every day becherweise melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik achieve a remarkably often many age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why life here in the south of so many high-aged?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explained that with the specific genes of Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is the food.
But that it should be the food of Talyschen kalorienreiche HEALTHY should be so, especially meat, bread and milk products, many of which have daily drinking a glass of melted butter, from a nutritional point of view is not plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years for this broad is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva,, which claims to have 143 descendants who lives in a simple wood house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor and barrel rolls with butter, you are working tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are now grandparents.
Two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen for the guests tea, which is served in the typical bauchförmigen Armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in their steeds and, under her headscarf hides it long, dark blond braids, her son proudly unveiled in front of us.
I washed my hair with milk, so I went out and retained their color.
"I have never used shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always eat only what came from their own station, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyew" took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange coming from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, driven by the father figure of the nation, ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no emergency in Azerbaijan.
, 230 Manat (about the same amount in euros) receives a monthly pension Mirzayeva here, an amount that you can live well.
And, perhaps, has also been Mirzayevas ergrauter Stemming right: "the old enjoy in our culture of respect."
They live in the midst of the large family, loved and cared for, are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay here for as long as possible to life
