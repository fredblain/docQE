In the last few days, it came across the United States to massive protests against low wages of Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue or whether you Distention soon from the air.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary workers almost food- and Wal-Mart, the organizers of the protests aim to form trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly organized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, sales were held in the United States, which attracted millions of customers, which led to Handgemengen.
On this day, some Wal-Mart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target audience are low and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores in the interface between 8 and 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
As a result, many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only at the workplace.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart has become one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Wal-Mart, the goods can often only sell so cheaply, because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, lack of forklift trucks or handheld scanners.
The participants in the protests in the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their irritation that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Wal-Mart employees, which earned 9.5 US dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company increased the average wage at 12 dollars an hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars it would cost.
The donations are about 1.1% more than they now pay.
The Walmart wage increases to the customers, every purchase you will only 46 cents more.
Every year, this would be for you in comparison to now more spending by only 12,39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it came only in nine states to protests and that gave the company any losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period, Wal-Mart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart funds from led to the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing not post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees working time and the protest action only "another PR stunt" of the union, which organized the protest, was.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where your goal, however, were not Walmart stores (which are welcome in this progressive city and therefore does not exist yet), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work.

Currently, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law stands at 7.25 dollars an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, according to the minimum wage will be raised, but not too much, and on average, their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars an hour.
No less than they deserved in this expensive city.
How it is possible to come to New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American youngsters after school at McDonald's behind the counter, however, the young people still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income and planned to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that they have to live with this wage and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, there are in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper in a commentary, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if they did not know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the FIFA Street and Madison Avenue, demanding that the cashier and chefs from fast-food restaurants a minimum wage of $15 an hour), which represents more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
It further demanded the formation of unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law that prohibits the company leadership to stand in the way of that goal and union members to admonish or being fired.
On the other hand, the corporate governance is not easy.
The formation of unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
Lautstarke protests on this day, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was an assembly in the middle of the day in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats languages, including City Council member Jumaane williams, said: "McDonald's says it should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, said that "we should come together to support the fast-food employees, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity that everyone deserves New York!."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
But only a few hundred people were on the ground, not all of which are in the fast-food industry, by far, in which tens of thousands of people working in New York.
It is still not clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize the masses.
