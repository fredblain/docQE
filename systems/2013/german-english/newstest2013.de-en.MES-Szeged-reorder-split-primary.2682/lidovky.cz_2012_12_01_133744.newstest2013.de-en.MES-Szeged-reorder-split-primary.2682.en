The film Argo: if the worst is that Hollywood call
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which maintained over the decades, the patronage of his regime.
For the US government, there was no positive way out of this situation, they could not afford to raise the Shah on board, which damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not in a position to enforce in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure of the violent attempt the hostages were only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations had been conveyed by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home caused a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat by Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the film director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the United States a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy employees.
This came after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA has succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; an extravagant story to cover their true identity helped them - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, supposedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction movie.
Combining the genres
The experts for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the cooperation of Hollywood.
The camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in trade magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but also a so-called "Bob Movie," the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs will be shown, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which ironically and repositionings Vollkommen so easily.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table in the office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is with this movie a remarkable start to his career.
From a losing a respected actor and director has become, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third feature film, the thriller not childsplay (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without gnade (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, is not in the director's native Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that contrasted with the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada. "
The best scenes in the movie play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the entrance to sequence the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, and conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when the story somewhere.
Affleck achieved a similar effect with his team with fictional scenes (the wrong film in a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much in too many places
The director also has had to deal with that history is not many in the cinematic sense exciting scenes.
He has been working with the little but quite successful, sometimes after helping the reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis averted at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or even the chase on the runway seem contrived something).
The weakness of Argo is to have its overly broad distribution, which is driven by the need to act to show too many places too much.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood Biofrühstück Baillon, although their figures were worthy but more space, and they are in the film is far from alone.
Afflecks film to lose traction. It is a movie that you watch with some interest and can goutieren the design and a thriller from the 1970s retro-style.
However, he has inspired enthusiasm.
As a reminder of today are in some way living piece of history and as proof of how excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, is it enough, however.
