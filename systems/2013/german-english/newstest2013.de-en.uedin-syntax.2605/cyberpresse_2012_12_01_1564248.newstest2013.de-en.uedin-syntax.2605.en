A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat the electoral fraud.
However, the latter holds the Brennan Center for a myth, as it confirmed that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republican lawyers have recorded in 10 years in the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: The new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these actions undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the Member States.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 has announced new laws which hinder the process for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition to these laws also shortened the time frames for the early vote annulled the right to register as voters on election day and citizens to file a court denied the right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state of the electorate wants to purchase an identity card.
Indiana was the first state that has made such a request.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years encouraged them in 34 states draft laws that allow voters to provide photo identification showing.
It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identification card as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, in other words, 21 million voters who lack photo identification issued by a government authority of their state.
Beyond Neuwähler five million in 2012 do not have such a permit.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay to receive the required identification.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification.
This goes further.
The students that are seen as voters cast their votes for Democratic candidates increasingly are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification issued by its creation.
On the other hand, the same states it would unite members of hunting or fishing, the stronger for the Republican side chose to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state has asked for proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduced such a demand.
For 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes.
Because it is clear that two of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states have also sponsored legislation that was abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups limited to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign for voter registration in general elections in 2004 helped to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the percentage of registration of Neuwählern 2010 has been reduced by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican lawmakers in five other states have also passed laws designed to shorten the period of the early vote.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who voted in advance, African-Americans, even though they account for only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who constituted 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate voted in advance.
Of course, have opposed the Democratic legislators and their supporters with the adoption of laws, which restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require showing a photo ID.
But the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the influence of the results in the 2012 crucial states passed laws and see them as a clear objective.
A report by the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that those states that have passed these laws, account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: The new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these actions undermine the democratic system of the United States.
