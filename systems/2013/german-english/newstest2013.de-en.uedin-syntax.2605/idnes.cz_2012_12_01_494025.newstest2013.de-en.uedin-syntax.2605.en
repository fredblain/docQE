Poland and the space.
Last week, the 20-member, Poland at a ministerial meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency, ESA this space agency, Poland is the second member state from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member.
Poland began in 1994, and participated in several in the following years, close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA projects.
Poland's journey into space began but much earlier.
Before World War II engaged Polish cosmos impressed with the space, but they are not always cast in understanding.
I recall, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought presented "entrance to Outer Space Exploration" for his pioneering work.
The ideas of the young engineer (nee 1905) left the audience cold, however, and after years remembered Šternfeld yet that only Dr. Gadomski Jan had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to Outer Space Exploration" the Prix donated by André Louis Hirsch and Robert Esnault-Pelterie rep deer.
Dr. Gadomski Jan (1899-1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in national magazines and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of space was hailed by the fact that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Already an inoperative railroad was built in Poland in 1925, was scheduled for a rocket propulsion.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remain unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or should be used to slow the trolley.
The details come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rockets and bullets.
The research led the institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia.
It is clear from the traditional documents that research had penetrated to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted, however, by the invasion of the German army.
In 1937 appeared in the trade press the draft by Ing. Rohoziński photoelectric hunt rocket on, and the following year was the work of "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba Krzywoblocky-Leliwa lotnicza" of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war were all projects for the military use of missile technology scientific advice from the Temporary Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet coordinated Doradczo Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, however, after two years of work, his work was finished by the start of the war.
Other articles appeared to space after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (ANRO received Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is dedicated to the four major items of space in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in 1954.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of an aerospace company.
At the time there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was clear that the future would have the exploration of space.
Since its inception in 1956 sought the Polish aerospace company PTA in order to join the International Federation for space travel, founded in 1951 and the PTA has actually been ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year was the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
This post he had held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 participated the PTA instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM 1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was made on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 pounds.
Started in 1959 and later became an improved version, the RM-1A, built in the two-stage rocket with flight tests the Bledowska Desert RM 2.
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another development stage should already be in a position to make real scientific work - the missile RM 34 should be used for the observation of high winds and reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km.
In 1962, however, was set to the further development.
The first rocket of the type RM successor was the meteor-1-Rakete developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its length was 510 cm and a starting weight was 32.5 kg.
From this rocket were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) to distinguish themselves from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rocket had a transport room with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1B about 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C about 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude was 37 km at all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 has a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 miles.
The versions were then built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Poland's joining the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research, followed two years later the establishment of a National Committee on the COSPAR) in 1960.
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos inter-program with Soviet satellites in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miro Law Hermaszewski after the Czech cosmonaut Vladimir Remek second Inter.
