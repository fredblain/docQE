With Bitcoin is possible without bank payment and selling
The opposite of the current monetary exchange between the parties on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees.
Furthermore, it is a political vision, as so often in these technologies tangible: The belief that the current monetary system designed by bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, the invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) Bitcoin both a virtual currency convertible (but in dollars, euros and so on) and a protocol for the secure exchange like BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin as a gift or as a means of payment.
After the Bitcoin rate had reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later on $2 before he has now recovered to around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world of real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in a report published in October on virtual currencies has shown interest in this.
She describes Bitcoin as "the greatest success with the virtual currency," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a game that you can win by playing or buy back (and sometimes exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
But each time, the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin auditors, trustee of the invoice book at the same time, money-issuers and buyers and sellers are all network nodes.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the account book spread across the entire network of public accounts are available.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task, which will start on the computers, with the winner, who is a sort of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, or the conversion of a large file in a short and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers will "take" the new transaction and add a number to her, "hacked" before the whole thing.
The goal is to find the number that makes a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily examine whether it is the right one.
The transaction is permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay less than 10 minutes to cheat twice (quickly) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other is still no link, as both have different fingerprint.
The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward on a regular basis, probably before the end of 2012.
The circulating Bitcoins are thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some leeway.
It also increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement in the performance.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and robbed the Bitcoin deposits.
"The used vulnerability is not the proper protocol," Pierre Noizat insured, the very Paymium has introduced, this is a company to pay with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported about the possibilities of money laundering by means of this anonymous service.
Cash also rejects these shortcomings, however.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations this.
They are accepted by others, such as the blog WordPress platform.
Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute in Israel have recently analyzed the invoice book and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are in circulation.
A "mega-sales" was launched in November.
"thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," is pleased that Bitcoins Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coin Abul converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a mobile phone with a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment, but uses Bitcoin validation of the transactions that are cheaper.
The owner also manages its identity, and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with retailers, and they do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
They must simply gives an address, which can be identified and photographed by a telephone ", Pierre Noizat assured that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend where hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally oriented systems be reconsidered.
"It will take some time before the Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, by the way, to re-evaluate the various, today as highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency.
