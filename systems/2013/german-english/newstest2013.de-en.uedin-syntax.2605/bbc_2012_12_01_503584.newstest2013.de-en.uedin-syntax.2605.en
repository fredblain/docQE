Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his inauguration, he analyzed the BBC's Will Grant challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic is especially bad in Mexico City.
Even on better days, this is an ever-clogged city, but a ring of steel was built on Monday, several important routes on the streets and in the capital absperrt ensures chaos.
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators in Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidents of binding and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon's Mexico can prove economically as well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives over the past six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week the US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he went on an equal footing with the US President, Pena Nieto act as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided over the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote village of Valle del Bravo reminds you like for example to him.
The holiday village residents attribute it to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can go on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that it once was.
His name with plaques hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel LA Hernandez, who works as a Member of Congress for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards the security and economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman LA admits that the party after 12 years out of the presidential palace of Los Pinos makes great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The allegations by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, rejects it.
He is a very direct guy, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, above all, he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view on their former governor.
The contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo in Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could not be greater.
The town lies hidden under motorway bridges and is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature.
At the beginning of this year has enabled the military to fight drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a corner fallow land near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico about 1,000 women - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Pena Nietos critics believe that he is not adequately addressed the problem of feminicide during his tenure at least.
In the worst case, however, his government have closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete, typical of the rundown district, fights Irinea Buendia with tears, as she shows me pictures of their dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
Her family believes, however, that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the rigid corpses had already deployed.
While her mother tells her story, looks back on us from the wall a picture of Mariana. It is appropriate in a cross that bears a single word: Justice.
But exactly this, so the family, have denied it until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, troubler, Nörglerin.
They want you to simply accept their verdict and mouths.
"But this is not possible if there were so many flaws and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday will tie the president, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families were affected by violent crime in the past six years, and the new president has promised, during his term, particularly to attend to this problem.
"I hope that as president he is the way he was as governor," said PRI Congressman LA in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
