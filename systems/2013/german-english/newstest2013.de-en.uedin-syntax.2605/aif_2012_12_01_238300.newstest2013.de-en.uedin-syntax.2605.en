"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While lawmakers and civil rights groups to discuss what benefit brings the law on compulsory language tests for migrants act criminals already with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families left behind in the home.
On December 1, a law in force, according to which each migrant work must take a test that certifies the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule only applies to immigrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests with the time according to FÃ¶deraler migration authority should be compulsory for all guest workers in the future.
It not only language tests, but tests in the Russian history and store the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must be found for both the conservation and the renewal of work permits.
The exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also exempt from this legislation are those who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Problem, meaning and protection of rights
Ask the entirety of the examination will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language and the Russian University of friendship, the St. Petersburg State University, the Moscow State University, and other nations are Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities, already more than 160 such centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, however, questioned several times before the entry into force of the law in the press the following question: What is it all about?
What changes is the requirement to show language skills for both the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, say the migration authority spokesman, go to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Board representation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected even before their departure.
Only organized recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future generation without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which put him under the pretext of aid in a narrow, dark shack, where he will sit with dozens of unmatched months without food and documents and slave 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you promised the One and, upon arrival, you cheated, decreased their passports and will not get the promised salary," the Tajik migration authority confirms the head of the main administration for labour migration, Tolib Schwaripow.
No grumbling, chief.
Yet to many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money that they not only do not speak the language of the country, but also can hardly express written in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much her fault, rather than the evil: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can only provide a sound basic education.
Because there is not even money to feed the children in their families, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school clothes.
As a teenager, these children will take the first opportunity to earn money immediately.
"It is difficult without knowledge of the language," to give them.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists say the following important aspect in terms of the law.
The test must drop only immigrants with legal status.
You do not have that status, so there is no investigation and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile keeps the bulk of guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "access to banned unauthorized individuals"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the language difficulties.
It also costs the legalization of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
You can quickly and simply make a fake registration for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that, for the most part, our documents forged and that we will emerge from this and are not registered cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow told journalists.
"merely spare no expense for false papers"
Earlier on the day the law in force, turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates that certify the completion of language tests have already been hijacked by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners of this not for nothing: Every migrant hoped to be able to save that the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a migrant work three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and civil rights groups agree.
For the moment, the authorities promise only guest workers covered by the test for the first time that you have time for a basic language course.
Newcomers without language skills are also offered places in areas where people with no active communication is necessary.
