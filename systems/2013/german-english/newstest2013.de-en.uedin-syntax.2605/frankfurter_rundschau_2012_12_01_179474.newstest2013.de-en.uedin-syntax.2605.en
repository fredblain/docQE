Messenger: NASA discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet will probably be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there is frozen water there, as is evident from three studies published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the region are constantly lying in the shadow of the planet.
This is supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 feet thick.
The water is probably came from comets or asteroids possibly taken on the Mercury.
No one put the discovery of ice but associated with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon said.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have come in different parts of the solar system.
Probes, small robots and telescopes such as Phoenix are unnoticed by the earth people to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time send images to Earth: Small black holes in endless expanses.
The image comes from a camera, the German researchers have developed the Max Planck Institute.

Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun beyond Neptune, the new definition of the International astronomical Union in 2006 after Ceres is no "Planet."

The Pleijades-star clusters, also known as "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
However, with the telescope will exploit the colors.
The Helix Nebula in this infrared photo looks like a red Age to the viewer.
He is light years away in the constellation of Aquarius-700.
Its resemblance to a half-continent brought this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infra-red photo ensures the spectacular color.
This baby star could be included in its full beauty only by the Spitzer telescope infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings that have emerged as this is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They are probably the remains of a Saturn-moon, who disappeared without a trace of 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and strongest images from the Hubble telescope: The whirlpool galaxy.
According to the color photographs of spiral galaxies are true works of art.
The recording released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The Trifid name comes from the Latin word trifidus (three) as dark dust strips the fervent heart of the birthplace of stars shared three divided three parts.
Carrier astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carom: 400 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of snakes down the seeds of two verschmelzender galaxies collide and will inevitably collide.
The birth of stars awarded the M83 spiral galaxies in the Hubble telescope.
Technical abbreviations like they do not lie in their nickname Southern performing name.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows an excerpt from the Iris Nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1,400 light years distant nebula consists of dust grains are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary dust.
This picture was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, took the Hubble space telescope for NASA.
The scientists call greater spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this fog is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new Young Ter.
This star-cloud, coupled with the rosette Nebula, also constantly brings new baby stars - 5,000 light years from Earth.
No dust, but gas still exists in this light bright galaxy with a small black hole.
Researchers suspect that it is only a short time after the Big Bang, when the universe was mainly to find hydrogen.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star watching a year later.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes were increasing - and the insights they deliver deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
Here in the picture, the mirror, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It will look into space, just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the capital of Gran Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone the mirror is at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The design disadvantage: The telescope is hanging in his elevation angle - and this limited in his mobility.
The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed at high angles.
His specialty: The high light collective strength.
Despite comparatively low levels in diameter, this is access to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) told researchers that space for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for extra-terrestrial trial Intelligence (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
The observatory view of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope - is worthy of that name.
With a total of four mirrors the telescope can shall include the medium-range.
Also on the Chilean ESO observatory is planned for the European extremely Large Telescope.
Its main mirror is expected to include a whopping 42 meters - and put together from just under 1000 mirror elements.
With photos, but is expected until 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna KEA, the Hawaiian volcano as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of 10 metres.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna KEA observatory that looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF alongside them.
Also on Mauna KEA is intended to create a new giant telescope with a mirror-average of 30 meters.
It is here to see an illustration.
However, the main impressions from space provides the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, extrasolar planets in the Kepler space telescope - especially for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that were identified 1,235 planet candidates since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the last documented start preparations on Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) until 2018 aboard the Ariane5 missile fired into space.
The primary mirror of the Space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that the Mercury ice at the South Pole also exists.
However, there are no reliable data, as the messenger is far closer at the North Pole revolves around the planet.
For decades, radar measurements suggest that there is ice on Mercury.
By the Messenger probe launched in 2004, the first which revolves around the Mercury, the scientists now have certainty.
