The cause of the deaths due to AIDS is now a belated recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when it confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor tried to "without apparent success."
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to concern itself about his illness and started to find out about it, and that with such commitment that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, it avoided even the director to adopt a clinic of the IMSS, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
Although there are still many people in the hospital who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already caused harm and has exhausted their immune system and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, "means the great success today that the survival of a patient who receives the treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that the information had been supported by a reputable scientific publication in April of this year.
An expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 final results were that AIDS was a death sentence, but that years of survival and the quality of life by the extent of the damage the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that those people would have greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, mean that the above, who at the age of 25 years the diagnosis is HIV-positive, in that sense, "can easily be 75 years old, so long as he is under control," said the expert.
In order to keep this progress right, it must be remembered that today, on average, the life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in the past few years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS to the annual report of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (yes)) reduced, it is nevertheless true that have died since the release of 60 percent of the AIDS patients covered in the national database.
255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year, it is already 187 deaths in Jalisco alone, however, will be assured that there are universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- Why is still dying people in it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drug. The problem is that people come in far advanced condition, because they do not know their infection status, that is in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a compelling statement: "Nine out of 10 patients come to us if you already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, so all persons, where this is necessary, need to be offered screening tests on a massive scale."
This proposal voting experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also for patients like Fabrizio, who made his test carried out at a private laboratory, and that the only reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age, was already in the era of AIDS and even the Kaposi's had Kaposi's Sarcoma (one cancer tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we would like to hear nothing.
"If I have to die, then burst like three times," says one in my case.
The change was good to improvement, I ernähre me do exercises and take the medication.
His parents now know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everybody else.
"I have to take a lot to have an active and responsible unforgettable pastime, I respect the other person and my health," Fabrizio agreed to share their intimate details with Jalisco MILENIO counts, in order to encourage those with his testimony today in the context of the global AIDS Day fear.
They should make the test if they belong to the Risk Group. The sooner they should know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they can learn how to live like all people in a responsible manner.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between the ordinary citizen and health programs, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places, "actually increases the distribution of condoms, before they were made individually, now they give us to packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
New infections for high-risk people include the young people.
"What do you have?" is a question of widespread ridicule of social workers, guidance staff in schools, assured employees in pharmacies and health care, do not want to expose young people, the correspondent.
He suggested to re-orient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only located behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoting promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question, whether condoms should be distributed under his administration.
"sexuality is not enough; it is the best way to bring the condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 1.317 HIV and AIDS).
The state is seen nationally in 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
Be 92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, blood and 2% 6% over the perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are four or five people for every registered case that do not know.
