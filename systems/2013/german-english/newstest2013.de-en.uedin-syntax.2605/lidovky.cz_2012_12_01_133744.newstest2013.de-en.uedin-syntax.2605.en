The film Argo: If the worst is that Hollywood's call
In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime.
For the American government, there was no good way out of this situation, they could not afford to jettison the Shah, because it would have damaged the trust of its allies in other countries on a massive scale.
At the same time it was not able to secure the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
There was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of hostage liberation made it even worse.
Captured diplomats were finally freed after 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which the United States led a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy was six embassy staff to flee.
It ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them to an extravagant story covering their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film Staff who allegedly visited a science-fiction film locations in the country.
Combining the genres
The plan developed by experts on "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, was also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
The camouflage was credible, published articles about this film project in trade magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, at the same time, a so-called "Caper Movie," which is the story of a successful job (such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This will change the mood levels - the documentary scenes from Tehran on one side (in the title sequence in the movie iconic contemporary photographs shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations.
On the other hand, the loose parts come from Hollywood, which is ironic and easy to exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at a conference table, in the office corridors, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable start of his career.
From a losing actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
ARGO is his third film after the thriller No snap (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is first film, who did not play in the director's native Boston Afflecks.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that this director's previous films from the standard Hollywood actors.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes in the movie play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity, and nevertheless conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when moving somewhere once the story.
A similar effect Affleck, with his team, with fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much plot in too many places
The director had to deal with this, the story is actually not many offers exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
He works with the little but quite successful, where he helps the reality for some of the time, then what is not always as elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a telephone conversation in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem a bit contrived).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is due to the need to show a lot of action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood employees are very charming, but their characters have earned more space, and that they are far from alone in the film.
Afflecks film is losing traction by something. It is a movie with some interest and it can approve the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years.
Enthusiasm, however, raises difficult.
As a reminder of a still living piece of history and proof of how exaggerated notions of the omniscient and omnipotent secret services, however, are in some way, but is it enough.
