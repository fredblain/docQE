Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the Ã¼belriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but all over the world.
The secret of success in the country could have something to do with the local appetite on pretty badly smelling fish?
Take a selection of mature cheeses.
One place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave it there for a week.
Just about one of the great delights of Norway, one must imagine the nose section of the Rakfisk smell.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours drive from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that simply will not disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which is fermented in water up to a year, depending on how one's stinky fish would like.
When the darkness comes on the country and the weather gets colder in Norway, Norwegian flock to Fagernes in a celebration here, which is dedicated to this, well, really very impressive specialty.
"You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass aquavit," says Howard Halvarsen that actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General" also organized the festival.
Around us eat small fish cubes and business people to pass large quantities of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit over the Rakfisk," says Howard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I eat a few bites.
If it avoids to bring the Rakfisk near the nose, he is not bad - such as sushi, which has quite a long bus behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and fish in the autumn has been soaked in salt water barrels airtight.
In deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and eaten, undoubtedly with steamed through alcohol senses.
Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and migrated mainly in the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who have not long ago was far richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strictly fragrant part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But is it expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people seem not to care.
Here are still hates it, Anders Breivik by its proper name - the racist right-wing extremists, who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it applies only to the "incident" on July 22.
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in a peace-loving country is capable of such brutal killings.
Norway's prime responsibility for the current wealth is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien growth since the early 1970's of the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is so good for us," says Anna, our waitress round trays with seasoned Rakfisk distributed, with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes, embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are a prudent, as the saying goes, people.
Her English is spotless like that of most people here.
We are not quite a show-off, "we may not emerge.
Norway is very cautiously dealt with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years before the Great Depression threw money around with all that they had never gave Norway its purse firmly closed.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course Rakfisk eating," adds them with easy laughter.
I am in the snow and put me on a different court at Rakfisk - I have enough.
As a moose-burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat told me.
But the evening is back on the menu of the Stinkefisch.
The hotel in which I logiere, is one of several venues to organise a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging smell sense - fish.
There is a live TV broadcast to a show with fly clad master, which is surrounded by Rakfisk plates.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here are our points, Howard."
They are sharing and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish.
