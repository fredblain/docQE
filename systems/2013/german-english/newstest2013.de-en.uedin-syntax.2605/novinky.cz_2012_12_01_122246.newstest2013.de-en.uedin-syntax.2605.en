Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
Every year, a poll on the most ridiculous charges, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com exclaims, has this year decided to organise the contest idea from EU workshop "or" most absurd regulation.
"At this idea gave us the recently put forward by the EU's plan to introduce a women's quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher who cares about the organization of this survey, compared with the daily Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women, for example.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage because they represent a lower risk for the insurers objective in life insurance.
"More incredible incursions from EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote is then carried out by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher with.
One of the controversial EU regulations including the mandatory admixture of bio-ethanol fuel, which is damaging nature in its aftermath, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively low amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive on the size of hen cages, because of this year eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism in 1967, in the past, the prohibition of the use of the term "Butte bus line" or even a ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas have to be 14 inches long
The EU apparatus is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels, as a rule, are represented by one or more Member States (as attempts at the Czech Republic, for example, also with a veto-threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind the highest trading class that bananas in the EU should have no "curve anomaly" and must be at least 14 inches long.
The European Commission defended it on the grounds that they would hinder the fragmented national standards only harmonisiere trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables were softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries with the reminder that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
The EU regulation is potentially a candidate for the victory in the poll last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons in the sale with the reminder that children under eight years cannot inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU is the leading cause of the suffocation of children in accordance with balloons, citing an American study.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years already using Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious incursions at home
Quite absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - anyone who occupies an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) must instead say.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the association of liberal economists laissez Faire, in addition to the above absurdities, the EU regulation on the scope of food supplies in the territory of a member country.
The EU submitted to the maximum volume of food supplies, which was located on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic on pace for the specified volume for canned mushroom, and a large fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or to provide funding for applications for funding from the idea.
These ideas were certainly not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement to the EU, "said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (5) in the autumn of 2004.
He led in the argument that the grain harvest was very high and the state stores were crowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic have another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us under the Palas.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, so far ahead that they organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding for the communities of the Ministry of regional development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), in concrete terms, it is a means for the establishment of aid money should be points to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception.
Regulations are in the Member States may easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts earned about regulation and hence effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, but rather recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, rather than the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were imposed in the budget negotiations by individual member states.
Emotions calls in this country is the fact that, like other members in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic could defend the title "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), a tradition dating back to the 1800s, had to rename our manufacturers, "Tuzemák".
The name may only be used for products made from sugar cane rum, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of diving in the company of famous feta cheese products registered in the EU and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham biscuits now of Karlovy Vary, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hop on.
With an EU trademark can brag because the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořicer roles.
