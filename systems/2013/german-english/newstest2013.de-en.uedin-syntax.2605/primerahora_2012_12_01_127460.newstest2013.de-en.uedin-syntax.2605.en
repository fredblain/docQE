Héctor "Hetin Reyes:" Basketball was my life. "
The basket was the way to the basket ball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, sports combined for more than 60 years and has traveled the world as a whole.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the country's passers like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, lower class, the first National League player was 6 years Rexes part of this sport, be it as a player, manager and agent in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My whole life I have set many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the national team BSN, CEO and president of the Association in the 1990s," remembered Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with his loyal wife Isabel, for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates not with this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and they testify.
Bayamón in heart
Those are the most emotional memories of his time as a player at the Vaqueros of the mid-1950s until 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or general manager of the club.
"That was my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as general manager, trainer or Mitgeschäftsführer eight championships.
There were many rewarding years, including five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "says Reyes.
I remember that I was Gene Bartow, who has worked as a trainer and employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m players.
Want him? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow recommended after the free throw specialists Raymond Gausse inhabitant left and was one of our best launchers.
I remember how he had said that if a championship for Bayamon Mincy possible, Gausse would lead to another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, as he stood at the top of the Association in 1988.
At that time, he plans to enjoy his executions and Mincy's in the national team.
I remember when we won against the United States for the first time at the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee would have allowed us to repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the 1990 World Cup was the best team that you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan Games in Cuba, where the US team offered a fight as they were when they won bronze at the World Cup against us and we won gold.
When the team were playing not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players "Toñito" Colón (Javier) and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and who gave us great joy, those of vorolympischen tournament in 1995 was varies, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
At the level of international tournaments, his numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at that level as Piculín.
And that is without taking into account the different leagues in his career, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Arman Dito Torres.
The boys like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you believe is the best thing that you have achieved in the dressing?
I was part of the team's most successful era from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s to 17 teams in a season.
What will you have to do?
There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes.
For the guys in Ponce, for example, only play on their territory and only in the national play offs meet teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children unnecessarily make many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, referees and officials-table.
I am proud of that.
Now what do you play?
I listen to music, watch videos from YouTube in music of my time, I enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
