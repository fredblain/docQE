Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
"... that nothing comes from violence, or ever could emerge" Fragile, "Sting sings in the song, whose main chorus verse reads... so that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"When my sons wanted no wars, there would be no," says the dying existed Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions.
Some are behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they support the Palestinians as terrorists; others argue with the racism of the State of Israel, the Palestinians, with the genocide perpetrated in the Palestinian Arabs and describe the state of Israel as terrorist.
At this point, I would not write about who is guilty and whoever victims in these recurrent waves of killing; in the end, today's residents of Israel, including the self-management areas have been born in the current political situation and have not even seen the start of the violence.
It is me about the readers to open a look behind the scenes, the look, whom the voltage 95 years (counting the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are particularly useful in the small patches of land in the Middle East.
My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, others are derived from and go from my own understanding of who or what group of people greatly influenced the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can make Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether there really were always these figures themselves, given their moves autonomously, or whether someone behind her throne was directed at a vorbestimmtes goal of their actions.
We have to admit that we live in a time where the wealth concentrated in the hands of a few individuals in the world, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Under this astronomical rich families is a particular, which could be described as the head of the kraken (I don't know if anyone else stands above them, I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
Much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century, in order to prevent the connection with criminal acts of its name, stood in the background is the consolidation of power, the proliferation of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all banks in the world, and to the countries where they are not involved in the central banks to wage wars or equip themselves to this (7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, it was five countries, before the attack on Afghanistan after the ouster Ghaddafis remained only four, while Russia has accused the central bank of the Russian government in the meantime.
Whoever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as the central bank began during the civil war, was assassinated in 1865 in a theater and publish their own (read: State) notes.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression.
The global appetite of the Rothschilds led by Albert PIK, a Masonic in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the unleashing of three world wars of the 33rd and highest level of knowledge.
The first war aimed to eliminate the big royalist states of Europe, by the second war should be broken in Britain's colonial rule, and the third war aims to reduce the global population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comfort and luxury and would not create as many resources), a universal religion (of ecumenism is nothing more than the prior) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method, in which the group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer for a solution (from Chao - is the order from the chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see foundation of the Fed to prevent crises like the recurrence of them triggered in 1907).
After they had succeeded Ferdinand in Sarajevo by the assassination of the Hapsburg heir to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the war was Czarist Russia no longer needed), then followed the dissolution of the Central European power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to spark World War II easier, the bankers could create a latent conflict by politics, by Germany occupied with huge war reparations; thus they created the condition of impoverished masses, so they had to cheer the Germans but a strong enough leader, named for the culprits and simple solutions offered Czechoslovakia; another factor was the creation of the multiethnic state with a strong German minority that should play the role of a fifth column and also took to ignite the fire of war.
At the end of the nineteenth century initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, a branch of the Rothschilds sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as in the historic area Judea with Jerusalem as its capital, the return to Zion.
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether the chain of Hitler massively, in which he had initially thought the international bankers, or if everything went according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, as well as the war reparations against Germany, the ground has been prepared for World War II, the declaration of the state of Israel is the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, the Jewish people will be similar to the victims of the Second World War in the battle front line, this time with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country, but also internationally (think about how sharply divide the people of supporters and opponents of Israel.
Who is the victim and who is the culprit in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, which causes wrong, just wrong in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning?
One must distinguish between the people of Israel and its leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel as well as us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fragile fascism, the international bankers loyal dutiful politician who does everything for it to ignite a war with Iran, in the face of Iran's membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly spread to a global conflict, and with it because of Iran's control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil supplies run could come to a deterioration of the global economy.
In the words of David Rockefeller as the light of 1994: "The only thing we need is an arching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population is a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted in the birth of a chip to subject the essence of total control.
"And it is that the kids and the adults, the rich and the poor, the open and the servants all give themselves a malt oaks on their right hand or on your forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he voted for the malt oak, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is a wisdom, anyone who has reason to put the number of the animal.
Because it is a human figure, and his number is six hundred sixty-sixty. "
