The operas of the US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecution has sought to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in American history, missed several opportunities to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military detention.
When cross-examined Mannings Erich Monaco during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein that documents had made weekly visits to the prison officials during nine months of prison time in Virginia, quan tico Mannings, had no complaints about his treatment.
The day before the cross interrogation that was held as a result of a request from the defense for the rejection of the indictment, Manning had been punished enough by the harsh prison time, Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then released by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning had filled in the forms, the officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the tico quan-military prison where he had increased from July 2010 to April 2011 under detention in Essen.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
As Fine interviewed him on Friday on the forms, gave Manning to that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as "very professional" as a whole.
The forms, so thin, contained no complaints of ill-treatment, although the officials had questioned Manning directly on his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, the officials have discussed this with him and given to deal with them, but they have not been logged.
"They wrote (concerns)," No problem, "debriefing on, and not necessarily meant that I said nothing at all," as Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why, when he met with a committee in January 2011, he is not about his treatment of values that should investigate the suicide thought he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied, his intention to leave during this meeting, it was downgrading its observer status to "prevention of injury".
The military said that it had given him this restrictive status, which is one level below the suicide risk, to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to get rid of the observer status on the prevention of injury and convince people that I was doing well (...) to be able to achieve a higher quality of life for me," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to the prison in July 2010 in Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before he was transferred to the Marine base quan tico in Virginia.
In Kuwait, he considered the suicide and was due to the heat to become unconscious, he said.
Not to be able to know what's happening to him, or in the outside world, had been wearing.
"My world fell together at Camp Arafjon, on the cage," said Manning Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was moved to quan tico, said Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
We have allowed him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he was trying to stay on the move, because the day had been forbidden to sleep or even added.
He always have to sleep with light, which moved into his cell from the outside.
If he had turned up at night and guards could no longer see his face, you have to wake him up so that he can turn back the clock.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the Mannings treatment.
In April 2011, Manning moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday asked the judge Manning also to an accusation that he had made in his statement on Thursday, so he had a night to sleep naked in his cell in quan tico and must be at a morning counting naked before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover up with a blanket during the counting.
In the survey on Friday gave Manning in that he had concluded his watch from a command that he should drop the ceiling, with which he might cover themselves, but he admitted that he had asked no one.
On Thursday, Manning testified that during the previous night, he was forced to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show an official that he poses no danger to himself.
Manning told the officials that he would have the federal government can use his underwear or his flip-flops to injure themselves, but this is not done.
On this night, Manning aus said, had been removed from his cell to his underwear, flip-flops and glasses.
His lawyers hope that the judge will drastically reduce his prison experiences at least take into account and his detention measure, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning is guilty of lesser crimes committed while other charges, which are seen as too extreme, are to be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend by the prosecutor is expected to justify the detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the rules that apply to all prisoners under the highest safeguards in quan tico Deutsche.
Among the charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
He is found guilty on all counts, he faces a life sentence.
