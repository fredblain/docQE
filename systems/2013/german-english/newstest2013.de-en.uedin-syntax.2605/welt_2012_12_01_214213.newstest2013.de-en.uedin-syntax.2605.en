In the south of Azerbaijan, many people can reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country in the 97-year-old is still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people can reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country in the 97-year-old is still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The rumpelt minibus on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and lush, one would think that it would be in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan is just a few miles away from the border with Iran.
The South Caucasus Talyschen community lives here, about which little is known, except that it is perfect speaks Farsi and Aserisch and very durable.
Last stop is Lerik.
The small town flaunts to wuchtig Gera podría architecture of Soviet times, so do not fit in the picturesque mountains.
Tourists come from Europe hard here, the route from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too onerous.
Of the 323 kilometers takes eight hours because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik tourist attraction of this stuff.
"Baku became famous with Eurovision Song Festival in May, and in the next year, we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita of about eight dozen Talyschen documents from the area, the more than 100 Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
Fathered a child at the age of 136 years
But controversial star of the museum has become the shepherd Şirali Müslümov of 168 years old.
However, there is a birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented people was 122 years old appears Müslümovs age but highly dubious.
"in 1805, he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and should have had 23 children at the age of 136 years he had fathered a daughter.
Has Şirali Müslümov so charged in his age for a couple of decades?
But also the age at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Rembrandt Scholz, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"striking many hochaltrige people is also available in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "live in Sardinia too many very old men."
Due to the lack of documentation was, however, no scientific proof were needed on the age, especially as people stand Register.
Every day means cup melted butter
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik striking often reach an uncritical age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why are so many here in the South-aged?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explained that with the specific genes Talyschen.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
But for all the calories of food the Talyschen is to be as healthy meat, bread and milk products, in particular, love and many of them daily drink a glass of melted butter, appears from a nutritional point of view is not plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? Lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years for these latitudes, it is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wood house that is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor with a butter barrel, they tirelessly back and forth herrollt.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are now grandparents.
Two infants also jump around.
The guests of tea, which is served in the characteristic, belly-Armadu glasses can be prepared in the kitchen.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly in chains and member, under her headscarf conceals her long, dark blond braids, her son proudly unveiled in front of us.
I washed my hair always with milk, they were never made to me and kept their color.
"I have also never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to life
It has only ever eaten what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not once bought groceries at the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
By 2003, he was in power, his son Ilham later took the helm.
After all, there is no need of Azerbaijan's Old.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), gets Mirzayeva per month as a pension, by local standards, an amount that you can live well.
And, perhaps, has also been Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: "The old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the extended family will be loved and cared for and are happy.
If that is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
