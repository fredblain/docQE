The most difficult job in the world: The human work animals from Kawah Ijen
For four euros are the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they carry on the steep, rocky trails 70 kilos of sulphur.
There are people for whom the work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn their living by retrieving sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the eastern part of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must rise every day down on the floor of the crater, where the burned gas from the earth solidifies sulfuric gas in contact with the air.
After he has broken out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds in total, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the final stone paths.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of age meters, but the weary carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, where they have to put their steps carefully and keep the balance so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that each step can cost her life, as she was a French tourist who years ago on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted.
The mine from Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur that reduce them.
On top of the hill, force them to run and shoot the way between the tourists like circus monkeys with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to balance a mining company has established a little further down to a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi (never rather) exploiting its workers and that the deposits in the volcano since 1960, which they 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur pays.
They then sold for every 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widespread and is used for the manufacture of string wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains us Anto that usually makes three flights a day.
He needed three hours for each course that he is completely done, he has at the end of the day but then 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such a seemingly inhuman effort is three times that of what he would earn working in the field.
"The daily wage of mine here, where the coffee harvest will be paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167), very high," said the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village in the area, and for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia, "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java, to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto puts his life on the line on Kawah Ijen for three years, has already left the first traces of sulfur in it, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I will be working here for two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This friendly and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could work as tourist guides, waiters or at the front desk of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of carrying Els.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and is on every morning at two o'clock at night because the sulphur tube where its characteristic yellow color in the dark bluish shines.
The shadows challenging, he rises in the light of a small forehead lamp in his helmet, which he bought with his own money, in the crater.
About 400 carrier load on the baskets with sulphur crater floor on their shoulders.
Despite its huge profits, the mining company does not reduce the sulphur mechanized to save costs, and provides those who work on their own account and paid for by weight, no equipment.
They also get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) bid a camera, the guardians of this nature demand money at a rate of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), along with the admission of the tourists who come for the shooting of the volcano and the human-el.
"This work is not for the people and for the animals' protests Madrusin, a preparatory, 42-year-old carrier, which operates three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that to continue, "as long as there is" because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and eyes itching, if the wind suddenly turns and the thick columns can become trapped in the mine, rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses, of course, in addition to the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have distorted by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back is Unainik with his 53 years confined in a position to carry a 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano on a goat path between the Bushes of three trucks to be transported to the camp in Taman Ari 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," said Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth missing.
Of his five children, the oldest works with his 30 years as a sulphur-carrier.
As time passes, but keeps the mediocrity generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: Those who work as human last el on Kawah Ijen.
