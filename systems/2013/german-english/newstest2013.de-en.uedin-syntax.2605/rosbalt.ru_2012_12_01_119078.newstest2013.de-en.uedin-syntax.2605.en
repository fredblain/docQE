Personal taste rather than culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing the "Petersburg avant-garde" project, which is dedicated to urban residents, who form the vanguard of art and culture.
On the select list landed already high-level representatives of the Petersburg scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The extravagant artist Kirill Miller is the new Rosbalt held.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded, dressed in red, the times were the Russian Museum, once the summer garden, found at scene meetings or at openings.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social and philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the Petersberg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man by his presence on the streets of the city and all thanks to his fellow citizens smile and ensures good mood among them.
Recently he snapped up a barrel organ and became St. Petersburg summertime because he felt ready for this difficult role in terms of its artistic life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you usually in red and not for example in turquoise or yellow in the city on the road?
I have chosen the color red as fashion designers, which deals with the look and the image.
In this world, the compromise between artists, image consultants and society is red.
In the company raises everything differs slightly from the gray norm, aggression and bad behaviour.
But through my provocation with the people I want to get involved.
Any of my past provocations was an invitation to talks.
- When you knew that you have to be painting?
- In an exhibition in the Cultural Palace main, were issued in my work.
I realized that I have to go this way.
Then came the old-time, but not officially recognized painter was at an end, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible.
I am friendly with the new generation of painters, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was "Pushkinskaya 10," and then was first closure.
I prefers to theater, fashion and music, really at all, except the literature.
- And all that is united in your kind clinic... It was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture where artists should assemble the best creators.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical and artistic club for the Boheme until the renovations, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: Tequilajazzz, N.O.M., and I also remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
Simple string and his friends sang songs to the play-back, wore tight shirts and trendy composer Igor Wdowin today was one of them.
When the group began to play live, it was "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the age of "Halli Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it was his great career, but he learned the basics for us.
Even the gallery "D 137" or the "Griboedov" club have their origin in the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a poll, when it came to the award "personalities of our city" in the press.
I won in the category of "artist of the year," and I was reached at the peak.
It is not easy to work in the new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In this day and age, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: You can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
- Your work have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the timeliness and sharpness of thought.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian museum as a" clown.
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was socially, but now it hurts and is afraid to be so.
In a clown blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we save the world, by requiring that everyone has to disguise completely.
Now respects everyone on the clothes and is based on the exterior and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps we should do not provide a person but should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
Recently we saw you in the role of urban-organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
If not me, then who?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
Before the other large groups formed the people: The Bohemians loved the One and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not one hundred-dollar note that everyone likes it.
Now you have to consider if you'll like.
Every cult star now has about 100 supporters.
- At the appearances of Stas Michailow come as several thousand.
- To abandoned women get him where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
Around 300 people and not 10 thousand for cultural reasons, so there is less money, management, and everything is based.
I did not destroy supporters, and the most important thing is that they do not cheat and what has been achieved.
In my youth I have painted these pictures that a collector even hung in the works with a number of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that usually come only at the end of a career.
Nowadays, there are many misunderstandings.
It means intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money refused to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
Petersburg - Kirill, what is missing?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real tsars it was different, because the Czar may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what might be the experts, but they will be barred because it requires more high-level experts to evaluate the former right and make their way free.
Now counts only the own taste.
The same is true for the Erarta, but with the difference that they say in all honesty that they will not accept any contemporary art and a painter, so we have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
Petersburg - is not the European capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can grow hard on the stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writer than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art needs to be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
