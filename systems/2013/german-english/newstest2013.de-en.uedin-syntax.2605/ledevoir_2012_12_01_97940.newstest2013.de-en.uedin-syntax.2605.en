Le DAAD | palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on "death with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of the life.
The debate must be resumed in the near future, although a bill being prepared.
However, there remains much to be done in this important area.
The DAAD tried to look at this more.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie yet.
The prostate cancer, which he aufzehrte, had left him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years," he said, half-hearted, lying in his bed at the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, you cannot be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: An immense weakness prevents alone to go to the toilet, and even to eat.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he agrees to be resigned to help with food.
He even managed to smile and to talk with the stranger who employed around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhea because this is humiliating," he shares with.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this malady.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man standing pinkelt," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
For some people, going back to the early stage is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept a retrograde step, he said.
Because in the view of several people who work in palliative care, major events taking place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients admitted in palliative care for the home of Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are inundated with so-called "healing" care by doctors and nurses who care about them, not more.
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear of dying "deliberately and through asphyxiation".
But by the disease, I really know my children.
"I have good kids," adds them.
"I have no wish more in life," she says, before she accepted that it acquires a mask to help her breathe.
She is expected in the next few days still a last visit to her son, who is from Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois it offers assistance in terms of food intake and body care with a group of volunteers.
The relatives will be used if there are no other options.
In order to make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec comes on a bed for the relatives of state aid.
This is very little, given that one day we will all die.
Here, life continued under the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It gives the dying according to an oral care with Pepsi or brandy.
Diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Last night, Mr X serves a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," said Nathalie Savard, nursing director.
At the home of Victor-Gadbois is not a day as the other.
In addition to an old man at the age of 93, the last family gathering in the courtyard is well supported by his pillow, while you do in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, died tragically, after he has tried everything, in order to survive.
"For six months are three to five beds are occupied with cancer patients at less than 45 years of age," agrees Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with.
53% of patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their abode, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, that is, to a care that is supposed to relieve the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of her life, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Association for palliative care home in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
This ensures that several major shortcomings in the Quebec healthcare in palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
For the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the healthcare system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all right to have a high-quality palliative care, before you accept, move on euthanasia.
Recently, she says, have I seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, but that it has taken measures to alleviate it.
I fear that patients are dying simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions hard until the last day.
The chances of survival of Richard Hélène were already minimal when it has canceled an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin that I will cancel the treatment, she told me that they regret that I abandon the fight, told them.
However, they had told me that I was in the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nurses, that it has not granted this wish, after a team of palliative care have been relieved of their pain.
But it must be said clearly that the relatives in pain treatment is not Janet Quarton.
After former Monereau, head of the company's relatives of the domestic relatives of Montreal, 8% of patients are not talking to a pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often returned to the terminal sedation, which amounts to the patient either permanently or sporadically until the time of his death einzuschläfern.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
More and more patients without pain relief will have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain will not be relieved say all the same sentence: "I will die."
But that does not necessarily mean that "I want you to euthanise me," but "I want my alleviate pain."
The realization of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.
