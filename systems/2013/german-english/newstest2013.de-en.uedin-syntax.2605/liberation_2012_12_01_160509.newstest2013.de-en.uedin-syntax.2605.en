A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains divided on the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily granted the unlimited power, more than ever, he has decided to put everything on a card.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt a final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had offered two additional months for the conclusion of his works to the House.
Egypt is now for almost two years based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only ensured an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents remains the president in his "autocratic delirium," he continues "breaks his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the part of his supporters be assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period, which means the brothers to renounce their project, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy, raging across the country during the protest.
After affirmations in an interview with the American Time newsreel Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Since the Egyptian people resorting to a hasty vote will be an ultimatum: "Either correct my draft for you or I keep the unlimited authority," the latter should take an alleged end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly, the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The Liberal majority is the appeal failed.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned themselves because they believe that they were not able to get their views on the other.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or the society acted alike.
Yesterday morning in a hurry 11 people, deputy members, have been added to the achievement of the quorum.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of the day... is expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the clock was not exactly the constituent assembly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, is, after all, identical to that of the 1971 constitution states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, is an important requirement for the establishment of Islamic law, had hoped that "the principles" be replaced by "the rules," which would have allowed more rigorous application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article was not changed, proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy," say the liberals who see this only as a propaganda blow.
Because, according to them, is the Islamisation other articles of the constitution.
She acknowledges a consultative role in Article 220 in mind, of the University of Al-Azhar, particularly with regard to verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier is disturbing, because "the people who will be asked to give an opinion, have not been elected and no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals are also fed by the fact that the next chancellor of the university will be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text is not an Ulema, but academics, some of which have been trained under the French system, "Alexis Blouet assuaged, a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitution of Transition writes.
He admits, however, that "there may be some ambiguity in relation to Article 220, because the terms are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One relates in particular to the "fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence, work that Red.
And in the future could be raised the question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide. "
Apart from its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday strongly criticised by the far-reaching powers, which he granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another sticking point: The powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will not presented to Parliament, but a national defense council.
There will also be a ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as human rights organisations have demanded.
The latter also share their fears in relation to the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right of free expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women underscores 2006 Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
They believe that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to comment last night on TV, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the Head of State will demonstrate Saturday.
