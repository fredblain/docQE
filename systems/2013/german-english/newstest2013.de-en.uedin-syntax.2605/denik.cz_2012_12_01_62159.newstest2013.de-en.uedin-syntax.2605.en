Our concerts on Šimon Ornest: Do we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the fact that the doomsday will take place in less than a month?
This is one of those emergency messages that we humans like pounce.
With our band The tap tap make more fun of them and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the doomsday.
In December, you also realize a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide charity event, which we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21, at 11: 10 a.m.
The day before, that is, on December 20, will be held from 21: 00 p.m. at three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, in a time zone, about 12 hours ahead, the Mayan calendar ends.
This idea comes from whom?
Then we have the idea developed jointly with our designer Honza Augusta, originally think of me.
We do not collect enough positive energy, in order to prevent the doomsday, but we would also consider together with the public in what state we pass this world for our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have developed a unique collection of T-shirts, shoes, bags and key supporters against the doomsday, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz we can also support the people.
The band The tap tap also has the so-called anthem, together with other performers included with the title "Armageddon" falls against the doomsday.
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. They will also play at benefit concerts?
Of course, at the end, provided that all is fine and the doomsday is not taking place...
The anthem should be sung by all the performers on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns together in a direct circuit by Czech television broadcast live.
The text Xindl X also sings the anthem by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the clip, with...
How did you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other people of the Czech culture scene that this implies that we realize many charity events and concerts.
We try to incorporate these people hard in our projects.
It turned out that most interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds benefit concerts against the doomsday?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo that we work together with the association tap the Jedlička Institute for six years before.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly maintained by teachers who help them at different activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to visit the editors, we want to help them in this way.
In connection with the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a private building, in which we have with this project should move in.
Each concert occur several groups and performers.
What criteria do you picked them?
We wanted to create a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague occur, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Eye, The tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "big events" are also planned for the future?
In May, we stand for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are ever in the United States, would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Its overseas plans are not just small, you are so far have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, the tap tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it first seems.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold, and we must, of course, many instruments suitcases and other baggage mitschleppen...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that sometimes I have surprised some.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there have been no problems.
By travelling abroad you have a comparison, as it looks in the various countries with accessibility, how it treats people with disabilities.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its early days.
Moscow is absolutely not accessible to Prague. It is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair alone is underway in the city centre.
It is not even there it goes without saying that a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator Newport.
Fortunately, there are clubs trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things that we are behind.
But this is still noted that an improvement in the situation depends on the efforts of the parties concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities can use self-employed in public space, go to the museum, toilets etc.
It is just not customary for a larger group of disabled people there is we are actively involved in the public arena with the band The tap tap the West a bit ahead.
Respect among the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when come from our ranks of prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change.
So far, these are only cases of strong personalities will in particular.
Tap tap is currently very popular if we take a couple of years back: What did you motivated in 1998 to form a band?
Then I started as a manager at Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested to deal with something hard.
And since I am musicians and young whites, among others, play, I founded a music-AG along with a colleague.
Oh, and by the time is that, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič to say, something out of control (laughs).
The band was known, but only in the last few years, are we not?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also begun to advertise active for us.
We become aware that if you are doing something and this is not visible to the outside world, its own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also make good editors, high-quality machines, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it with The tap tap so far?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that we can deal with things differently.
In show business today often copies of the others.
This is logical in its way as anything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of the spectators usually is, of course, pity; this is only natural.
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature, we would regret it.
There are people who can develop and live a normal life, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities achieve something, this is a step forward, not only for themselves, but for the whole society.
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a strong leader, as do many people hear?
If you want to do something well, many things in one should not compromise and must also demand a certain discipline.
But it seems perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with romantic notions, and if they see that they have twice a week trial, must complete preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then transfer the enthusiasm among many quickly.
That is how it works everywhere, in every band that work seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The tap tap has 20 members.
How many of them were present from the very beginning, since 1998.
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. We cannot prevent that.
Who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome to us.
