Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with university degrees in education and learning, says that it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform, to guide the children and young people.
"The Internet was established as a medium for the search for information, with the appearance of these sites have changed the rules of the game but," she says.
Porras explained that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in education at Yale University and author of the book "digital natives and immigrants" shaped these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
They are the digital natives, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we learn even more," he says.
He says that this is a complex issue, "because we demand of them that they have a defined criteria about what can be said or spread, published, and that in an age where the maturity of this is not enough."
"They should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be loved to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions, they will bring food for thought.
"to tell you they should not do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras calls after some possibilities: There are things that you would not tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, if you like, if you published a photo of you, like the one that you've released from a friend?
You know, what others publish about you?
If you have photos of celebration labelled the other people asked for permission before?
And one more question: Should all know what you do at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online, as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone is outside of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he said.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professors, primary school teachers and educational consultant, said that it is essential that parents read carefully the directives of social networks.
If you understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one account on the Internet.
"For example the age, or what can be published or shared," he explains.
According to the Guardia, children need to be reminded of the "Thou shalt not speak with strangers" lesson.
