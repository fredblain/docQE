Singapore needs babies to rescue the economy.
The SWF blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the upbringing of children.
"The people of Singapore has to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, You're my patriotic wife: We meet our civic duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but still, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a rapper-songs, who is pushing local slogans such as "a" Bao "(loaf) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising firm BBH, which has shot the video, preserves the hope that the commercial achieved in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to perform their "national duty".
This is something only for the internet, so we had to make it funny and witty.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The breed is the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue we had to take action on.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume flirts with Pheromonen or the organization of speed-dating evenings (fast).
Be that many of these ideas were creative, it led to success but not mandatory.
So we thought: Why do we not be as creative as possible in order to address this problem, for example, to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore is he that this issue is not easy.
Every year, they are $1,300 for policies to encourage people to have more children.
Couples and parents for a package of government grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city state in southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national population authority the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why does the SWF not have more children?
Spouses and family policy for Tan Wei Ming, director of the national population Authority, says that it was the result of a "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled the people, except to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities," she said.
These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single parents and the delay of marriage and birth, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims at a drastic increase in the immigration to counteract the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
There are Web sites in Singapore, where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese be criticised that they keep wages low and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the governing party in Singapore last year reached its worst election since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate of the known effects on economic growth of a nation that has the health costs, tax revenues, and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments will be built.
They also have an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can support the lifestyle of the single, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company selling El Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" is much more quickly than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
The result is that they are much better for our cash flow.
He is, however, the developers, the new standards to be clearer guidelines, which were previously stumbling blocks, if they wanted to build too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if the new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate is the talks with the Singapurern who work in the financial district, to see that they will have no big effect.
"The people are strongly stressed that the education and housing are expensive, so it will be postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me, it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old man.
Men and women are engaged in their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that they cannot have children.
The SWF therefore have the last word, when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much.
