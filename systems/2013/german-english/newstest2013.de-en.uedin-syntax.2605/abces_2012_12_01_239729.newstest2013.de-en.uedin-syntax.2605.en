"Valentino has elegance of celebrity"
Speaking on the occasion of "Valentino: Master of couture" exhibition, which opened in London this week, ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian Modemachers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has acknowledged at the opening of "Valentino: Master of couture," the designer, put together a magnificent retrospective, for the more than 130 haute couture dresses were created by the "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this building," he said with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a history, whose sole protagonist "il signore" Garavani, but without his distinguierte clientele, could not have been written.
Valentino had always fascination for the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, on Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece.
Valentino shows this personal memories as a trophy of his social ascent from humble fashion makers in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
To be in love with the nobility, must not be at a disadvantage.
"At least they tilting at your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from the music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two of them lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant host.
"We all rejoiced when we were invited in his house in Gstaad," explains the wife of "tired" Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Ramsgate Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
Yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza, too, do not forget the charisma of the Modemachers.
Many years ago, we went to his home for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At his home, every detail of decoration, the food and music, and his influence can be felt.
"All invited felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model" that began her career in the week of haute couture in Paris in 1995.
"He is never out of fashion, because his designs are works of art," she says finally.
Fashion shows of origin
Garavani's life is a story of an se discretion, rather of mutual love ties.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was turned into a glorious and 60-metre runway, which proposes a roller lets the user takes the place of the model and go along the catwalk to admire a beautiful "audience" that bears masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress, the Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, chose the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a coat made of wool and leather, which belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience from fashion dolls exude names such as Sibilla de..., Gloria von Thurn und taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sof√≠a von Habsburg.
Abascal Naty and the fashion-maker, 2006
Many of those customers say the first Valentino is like your first love, "unforgettable."
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I draw him above all others because of his great love for women and because it highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of flamenco.
I like the colors he used very; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leaders in the fashion Patricia Della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of it, once the age and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
Finally, at the end of the 1990s, it added.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was flying skirt and a draped bodice with a red dress with a neckline that makes his presence.
"It was a dream realized," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion from his obsession is timeless," explained the Italian Aristokratin who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d'Arenberg retained their evening dresses of Modemachers "with the utmost care" to "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the memories associated with them."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House, the wedding dress for the wedding of Marie-Chantal Miller with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion-maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to produce this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, 12 different embroideries and a four-and-a-half metres long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society."
For years with the "savoir-being tarnished" of the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the highest award of the Legion of Honour, combined Garavani so many honors, as each of the husbands of its customers.
"I will always be his refinement, his quiet, neat and perfect exterior noted," gives D'Arenberg too.
I saw him the last time before a month at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And it says a princess...
