The architects MVRDV show that the true adventures are not only in the head, in the case of Spijkenisse and the recently established books mountain, 2 photos
"I think the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," said Lisette Verhaig, a technician at the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby farm, says: "Nevertheless, it is beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man is still voluntarily in one of these old-style libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a little visit need special-record holder is sleeping city at the gates of Rotterdam.
The town of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest rate education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid thing, one of a few years ago decided to contribute to general education and the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro seem to be pretty bepinselte reinforced concrete miniatures clones.
The success of the educational offensive has not been particularly good.
And so did the city fathers that there was only one way, the statistics must be Mr: A library.
Winy Maas by the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of the foolhardy bar charts and producer of funny or often cynical buildings, appeared at the competition-hearing in 2003 and took the matter with the usual composure with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury is still intrigued with his shoulders and looked around helplessly, Esspecially a five kilogram box of dry dates of cheeky Maas his fine jewelry according to the size of a pyramid and ended his actionist founded speech with the words: "Dear municipality."
This is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse books, he, therefore, for the so-called tailor-mountain.
Nine years later, the 30 million euros is expensive mountain Rwy14.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes garage, supermarket, post and a couple of adjacent living and terraced houses with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books with the second prize was awarded "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award in 2012.
This is the faceless small town retort that until now no longer had to offer as a postmodern pedestrian and disbelief ugly town hall, behind its white facade, one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: Books Eldorado bubble.
There is a lift, which runs right through the mountains, but the real space and reading pleasures are opened to within reach of the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the ceramic clinker soil and elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square.
The urban setting is perfect.
Boys and girls are already looking for a park bench, dog and playing football.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and is in the middle of a large, dark room, is the most uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have the classic room configuration on its head and put the reading area from the inside to the outside world.
The interior of the book "is shrewdly: In the middle are central offices, internet library, Chess Club, environmental center and home technology.
The black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall panels, sometimes parapet, times 220.000 Dollar is a particular pleasure.
Look, feel, and smell are foreign.
Even hardbitten architects and engineers unknown elements of whether offs shake their heads.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," said Joop Trou Borst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesl√§ndischen farm one day came across a suitable waste from agriculture.
For many years is used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimetre thin plastic film as root base.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two seasons, then it is ripe for bulky.
For the library, the fleece, for the first time in this volume, pressed to four centimetres thick slabs.
Under heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, burden-material that smells a little after new cars and sport shoes after a little.
After 105 steps, we arrived at the summit.
At the end of nearly 500 meters long wanderings will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch dry dogfood and eingetopften Ficus trees in the literary cafe.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology, despite the many windows," says Trou Borst.
Will be heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the book mountain is under a glass fall, even on sunny days, the sun appears only briefly into the interior.
The broad wood glue binder, which are across the glass facade, serve as a shading and catch a large portion of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic of the IT industry, already dared the way in the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde to tailor-mountain soul even as Spijkenisses "long overdue."
The reason: The opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
That should be filled once the optical gaps in the library has not yet been fully stocked, currently 70,000 pieces, for the time being.
The concept has taken root.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation has some relationship to each inhabitant of this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only for groceries.
MVRDV managed those king discipline called identity calls the jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
So young and uneducated it may be.
Finally, this is a starting point for identity.
