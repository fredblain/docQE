The Higgs analyzed only 1
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bosons last summer has a certain amount of consternation, and with good reason.
We believe, in fact, that only 1 is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And, after all, is the last particle predicted that the existence of the standard model of our best or "least bad" declaration of nature and the behavior of matter, but was not yet observed empirically.
But it is not yet fully safe for the physicists that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs tetraquarks strongly resembles.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data that were presented in this week of a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are still missing data to be completely sure about that.
We are still working on the assumption that it really is the Higgs, as apparently only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we look at what it is about.
This means that two objects cannot be present at the same place at the same time, there is an inevitable past law in this world.
It is not possible to break this rule, and don't try too hard, because you are hurt themselves.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world turns out that such a law applies to them too: The Pauli's exclusion principle that says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they find themselves in the same "quantum state" and the "state" largely consists of some of their properties.
On this basis share the particle physicists into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens be described as a Fermione, and obey the Pauli principle.
And in another move the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - at least not this principle, which means that they can, in fact, are in the same place at the same time.
These bosons members, according to the Web site, The particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: The mesons, which we will not treat here and the "force" that spread the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs particle tetraquarks related in some way.
It must be stressed, however, that these particles are not all so exotic creatures, as one might think.
If you are able to read this story, it is only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The photon or the "light particle," which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If, in fact, a particle accelerated with an electrical charge or change the way the electromagnetic field will come to this place was "upset" about like a pebble thrown in a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "winner of force."
More stable field
The same is true for the Higgs only 1, with the difference that must be "disturbed" another field, the Higgs field, so that shows that only 1.
But the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen needs to reach very high energy, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could be only a very large rock mox.
Therefore, the Large Hadron Collider, a giant particle accelerator as the CERN required is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energy.
The analogy of the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd again.
There are, in fact, not all materials and not all particles that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others not, for example, a sheet of paper would never think of themselves in the refrigerator.
And not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
For what all this research can now be "good," asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they serve the revision of the standard model (SM), and they allow physicists to closely examine all deviations from the observations and predictions of SM.
There are also many physicists eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could open the door to a "new physics" and fill some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter has serious shortcomings, as it offers no explanation for dark matter and gravity (ups!), which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (re-ups!).
However, at CERN, such differences were not found until now.
Impact
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs have not believed that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact gave us the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself has developed the first time line laser (NI) were the first - said that the laser at the beginning was seen more as a "laboratory" gimmick.
Imagine...
Applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle again in 1969 during his work has developed a small light sensor in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose this sensor serves today all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
Of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
