The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work.
That decision provoked a lively discussion among the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital that goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages), there will be price tensions.
Under this concept is a condition to understand where the manufacturer is trying to insist by importing cheaper goods in economic competition in the competition "undercut" in order to seize a larger share of the market and to increase its profits.
In a large-scale means that for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap there, or to give up their business, and the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs.
Since the private capital needs no social responsibility and therefore bears no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, rising government spending.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and to replace this society of economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well known, so precise statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in which governments are forced to engage in competition with each other in the individual economies to artificially lower the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments will deliver its own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly true in modifications of existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in terms of wages.
This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment and on the other by restricting the rights of workers.
The results are growing poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
Germany has been around for a number of years public food distribution points for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of victims is already in the millions.
In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy is on a regular basis to cases in which such a low wage workers maintain that the state must increase their income by subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of auxiliary staff working in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures virtually all the EU's southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society, and we hope that some private investment capital is flowing into the country.
Here is the question of where this capital comes from nature?
If it comes from another EU country, only moves of poverty from one country to another, or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees are working for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state should not involved with capital of its own economy, and that a planned economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital insisted blinkered in its position that the state should not interfere lenkend in the economy.
Then you have to ask, however, if not the private capital of the policy and that affects the entire state in our own selfish sense or even draws.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent in all states lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, reciprocal privileges, a law in which virtually everything reprehensible, but nothing is punishable by law.
The situation is such that a State Department without private finances closely interdependent with the industry in Germany right companies charged with drawing up draft legislation.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The violence is no longer from the people of how to declare the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
Apparently caught the liberal democracies are currently in a situation as it quickly Appian describes in his book on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius': "The state has long understood the collapse, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, through illegal bequiles of benefits or with stone and sword.
The corruption proliferated already bought votes with abandon, and the people went to the polls... "" people with character is not applied for positions, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline. "" You really started to talk about it that the only medicine in this difficult situation is an autocracy, and that a strong man should be chosen "Appian thought is to him, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who replaced the democracy on a permanent basis by the autocracy.
As it turns out, is based in today's society, as well as in ancient times on the reckless preference of own benefit without having to pay interest on the whole society.
By its very nature, the private capital is not able to recognize and enforce the benefit for society as a whole.
Today, as then, the result is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not strive for deeper reforms in the least.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore look in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current situation, the demise of the regime in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as some pause, in the next round is already apparent.
The fact that today's elites in the future is particularly disastrous loss witnessed by hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance face.
The repeal of the law on charitable work here is no solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of European and global economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population down.
Therefore, this trend is due to system.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of the people on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital into the company in favor of the state.
