"People want me to save the republic, but I'm only an amateur," Okamura said.
Senator, why is it on the idea to run for the office of the president?
I do not want to be president or senator.
If everything in our country would work without any problems, I would stand anywhere.
But I can no longer be plundered by the Republic for 20 years, as thieves roam free, while the people are increasing taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I'm already over 40, and to independent and belong to influence things, I have no other option than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
In the Senate, you have done it and then made off on the road to the castle.
It's not your constituents back?
I have said all the time that I will take up the fight at the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I have said that I will run for the office of the president, if I am elected senator and refined it.
My goal is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realize my vision.
For this I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate.
The problem is not only that we as a people shouting in the pub and in front of the TV, but turn down anyone who wants to make a difference.
This will confuse the freedom to lie with the freedom of speech and the media who want to rob the honor.
About me, it was claimed, for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was manager of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your vision.
The battle for the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as retrospective asset statements you have recorded more than 20 million kronor.
You need to change laws.
As President, you have no authority in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I argued that the guide remains a free trade, and it could be enforced.
The problem is the quarrelsome politics, if someone comes with a good proposal from the right or the left, this is deliberately rejected, and that keeps the population only on.
As an independent party or do I have a much greater potential to win support in all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of any party that can take what is best for our country.
Watch as a man in politics rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left.
For me, this right-left-thinking but completely irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or the right, I want to unite the people.
I always support publicly every good solution, even if it comes from the mutual or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
They dislike you, if someone called you populists.
But this confirm that what you just said?
If you draw up a business plan in a company, then you have both a vision and an ideal target.
And do you want to approach this.
You can call it as far as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world already, or they have been discussed by relevant experts.
But without support in Parliament will remain mere buzzwords.
And that does not go far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk long enough with people, you will be able to push through the material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other option.
To achieve these goals, to convince politicians, journalists and the general public and to try to bring them on our side.
As president, there would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to the statute book.
And the Angesprochenen would then possibly have to say why they oppose it.
A strong personality points to abuse can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, who was a virtue of public pressure.
I would like to say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started with the policy and try to find the support of the majority of my program.
I always try to assess the situation, and if it doesn't work then I go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can do nothing, and therefore I have discussed this with several well-known personalities, whether they want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with Jančura Radim, for example, but rejected due to overwork.
I have also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová that exposed the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
My candidacy I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters went to the polls not at all, and those who are left are usually elected representatives of the establishment.
We are thus only two independents in the Senate.
The people have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and chief men.
Are you considering the establishment of a party?
I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to review the past of each potential party member, and do not have the money.
I have not even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
You have no money?
You talk about financial statements, what would you be?
I value my private assets to approximately 60 million CZK.
I have a property with a value of 25 million, about 10 million for an apartment in Prague, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for a Škodu position, which is worth about one million, and then I have a few million and 3.5 million in the bank.
The Aston Martin was also a children's dream - James Bond always liked me, as he drove in a car, was published to women, and at the same time fight against evil.
They drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but you do not put your own money.
It is hardly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make some debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is probably not a great deal of interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senator close budget alone I could not live, so I like my son could not finance the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing.
Keep on working as an entrepreneur to have your livelihood?
You said that you will not drive back these activities?
But that is not cooperating with the wage level.
As promised, I have reduced my activities in part.
So, for example, my deputy managing director of travel agencies in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan saves the Republic.
But I must also live on something.
In what month income have you used as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As president, I would stop my activities are entirely.
