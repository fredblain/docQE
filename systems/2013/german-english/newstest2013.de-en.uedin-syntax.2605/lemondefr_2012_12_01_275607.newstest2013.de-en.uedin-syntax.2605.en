Real estate scandals on a large scale in Quebec
Officials of the Office of road construction, Bauhauptgewerbes Geldbeschaffer of political parties and the Italian Mafia experts tell every day, what they know about a great "system" of companies that are involved in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
"Industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayer in the province of Quebec, Canada, in particular in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange, as the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures," a small audio recorder Jacques Duchesneau, an MEP in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him for a thorough investigation of embezzlement in connection with the contracts to road construction in Quebec, the former prime minister had agreed only reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the study in 2010," he said, "the Department of Transport alone would have saved $1 billion to the treaties," because some zügelten their instinct to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors on a case," he adds, in the hope that it will be able to "demonstrate the tactics behind the individuals."
Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit
Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit is making great efforts to identify and government analysts, accountants, with their troops.
Besides the policemen of the "sewer cartel" that "Marteau-force," which has led since 2009 Montreal in the artificial inflation of the Treaties restrained manner...
In recent weeks, they carried out house searches piles and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal assemblies as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having received bribes in exchange for public contracts repeatedly.
Engineers were also specifically accused of road construction office of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, like Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has attracted attention by the Commission of the functioning of the "system," he said to the maintenance of public contracts.
He has received several years in Montreal 3% of the value of contracts linked to the Mafia with a paid agent who gave the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Beitrag Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000's, when he was more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberal landslide in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fundraising for the liberal former Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described it in detail before the Commission: In ten years he received gifts from contractors, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as 736.000 dollars in bribes in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials of the road office have admitted that they could lubricate themselves by making the bills with false services artificially by 30-40% aufblähten.
Martin Dumont, an organizer of the party of the mayor, accused Mr Tremblay that he has deliberately overlooked on a shadow budget, its coffers filled with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, and Montreal crashed into a serious crisis.
Chantal.. was one of the first members of Montreal, suggested the alarm.
As the mayor of the city district, in the eastern part of the island, Rivière-of-Prairies rejected themselves in 2010 against the sale of municipal land that was purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million in property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% of black money in election campaigns
In the study, carried out in the end, she says that she is "on a thread that makes it possible to understand the workings of the system of ants under his hands to stop the evil and to expose the guilty."
It says that the procedure was "painful but positive".
We are about to clean the wound but need only one for Montreal certain investigative unit, as well as an oversight to prevent a return of questionable practices.
It is clean.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part in that, "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is especially concerned about the role of "office holders who are aware of the tactics," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a share of 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec a small audio recorder he: "I was told that it was just a poor substitute of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to political parties to $100, which, according to him, nothing would change in the situation: "As long as the campaign spending are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the procurement and funding of political parties: "We cannot fall deeper; when we get to the bottom of the things with courage, can we rebuild the house on a more solid footing with more controls and laws."
If this story damages that Montreal and Quebec's international reputation, Mr Duchesneau urges people to laugh about it to take a look in their own backyard.
