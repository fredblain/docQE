Prostate cancer screening: The test should be done or not?
The PSA test do indeed sometimes faulty results, with false negatives and false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to a greater reluctance of undecided men already for the holding of early detection tests.
The test should be done or not?
We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States passed a series of disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without screening.
This study has also shown that is the likelihood of forming metastases by 30 to 40% higher under observation after 12 years if no screening has been carried out.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 40 or 50 years, if you have a direct relative, who had already been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
In men Afro-American is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, once a cancer was detected.
There are aggressive and other cancers, the Indo seaside.
The patient has to really understand the extent of the risk of cancer will be made by him pointed out the possible options, in which prostate cancers can remain untouched, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in this case you would rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today is taking place in many men, in which it has detected cancer, no treatment, as her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active surveillance in them and offers a treatment for them in progression of the disease.
It determines the criteria for deciding who should and cannot be treated with increasing accuracy.
Therefore, I recommend the implementation of the test.
But the most important thing is to talk with your doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society of Urology Movember has developed a tool with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and get enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise at least 50%," said Andre Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely harms people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: The abandonment of the cigarette after 10 years, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, bowel wrath, mast Speiser√∂hren-, pancreas, colon cancer and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against colon cancer wrath," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm- or rectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, salting and drying can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"the latter can damage the cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have examined the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While a study has found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another likely showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also been shown yet.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed how important it is to talk to his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
