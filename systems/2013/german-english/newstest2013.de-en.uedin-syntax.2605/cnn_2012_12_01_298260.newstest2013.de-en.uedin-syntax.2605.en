My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control than me in perplexity spread.
Signs pointed to two queues: One for "Wochos (Mexicans), another for" Extranjeros "(" Aliens ").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic symbol - just as in Boston, my friends call "Irish" or "Italian" my friends in New York.
Later I decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or dashes.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to claim me in an interview that language at both ends.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will also not going on.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment after this week, as the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
All those issues were on the agenda, which is expected to meet the heads of these two countries: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy and is one reason that Mexicans today is just as likely to remain in Mexico, rather than emigrating to the United States.
He would like to ally themselves with the United States and Canada, and create a North American trade bloc after a model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun that forced them to leave more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans to think in centuries, not in minutes, memories of this event will not be overlooked.
Once that is a U.S. government official even mildest criticism of Mexico exercises, hears complaints about how the American press the sovereignty of its neighbour, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country.
And the children of Zuma's go on the war path.
Yet the greatest challenge lies in Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that, at a point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or parents immigrated to the north and was commanded part - no chance in Mexico.
And in most cases was that person a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have received good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is perhaps sometimes blurred, but as regards our loyalty, this is not the case.
Clearly, this is the United States.
We are also aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican leadership.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
The Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
They believe that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they were not left.
And then we would not see caught behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and object to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are, and Mexican Americans take them so badly.
While she is a US citizen, they see themselves as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans that I know have the feeling of belonging to neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we will be seen as an American.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my visit, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: Some parts of the bourgeoisie education and Mexican leaders want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to represent their interests in the United States, Mexican Americans use as a temporary "ambassador" for Mexico.
We should tell our American colleagues about it, how great is a visit to this country and put pressure on the leaders to step up their ties to Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in the face of unfair income distribution, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it really is a great country.
I am afraid that you alone, amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge as their family members were treated fairly recently.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican," than I thought.
