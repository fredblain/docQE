"brand protection" in China: If Armani and Puma are suddenly Chinese
Armani also is a famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind it lurks a term officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Yet it is protected as long as the actual name donors do not complain.
Even then, it is not clear whether they will get justice.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in copyright infringement in the Far East.
Every week a new case landed on my desk.
The imitators are already a few additional letters, so that they can register their brands.
So, instead of simply Lu-Gucci, Gucci, Prada Prada Kny register.
German companies will also be legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010 was the trademark Zegna DF protect Puma, a Chinese company named an art that is also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injured intellectual property is well known.
There are multistory department stores that sell counterfeit almost exclusively in the big cities.
Stalemate hole cases but are different: On behalf of his clients, he is against Chinese companies from the internet to officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
Women who are rich men fish.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"It will be bad for business, you have to fight it," stalemate hole demands.
"The brand is watered down, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The process costs of the affected industries and the financial losses are in the millions, particularly in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros a year is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go to the money.
Up to nine years can drag the procedure with uncertain results.
Stalemate hole reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints because complained after the long duration of the name had become the "market" reality.
If the plaintiff had bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money, because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the machinery maker Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker shine master.
The Chinese may still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely was originally a blue and white logo, which reminded on BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion maker Lacoste lost against followers in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, which the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The trademarks agency CTMO in Beijing, is that there have been shortages in 2010 due to lower personnel and facilities.
Last year was one of the "emergency in the workflow returned to normal."
So is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals have decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have completed one, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting in the office still 81.500 objections to completion.
To confront this costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, when CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This means that China and was a record for the 10th time in a row, the list of members worldwide lead, informs the authority.
That also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011 had been taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
Simplified means that any registration costs an average of 160 euros or 1280 yuan.
To confront this costs many times, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the group's fight against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans could reach the imitation of illegal production of automotive parts was unearthed.
But secured the Chinese rights of followers of the Freudenberg brand.
We have failed this as surnames in Germany could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler says, the Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical spec-Ties in Munich.
The trademarks agency CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich back as well.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg may be right, but the process is fighting against continue to this day.
We must have extreme caution
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also said: "This case is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly put the company archive must have even see a hundred years through old records to prove them.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered a "high six-figure euro amount" of the other party in vain for a settlement.
"Because we see how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
Even after Europe zur√ºckzuschwappen threaten the dangers in the Far East.
That is, when they grow unprotected brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration.
"You must be extreme caution," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole rates German companies tend to be very cautious in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, should the foreigners "everything that is worth protecting somehow register in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this will be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg in the last act of his trademark drama below deck, one of the other side should pay royalties for its own name, said Wentzler.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the segment in question.
