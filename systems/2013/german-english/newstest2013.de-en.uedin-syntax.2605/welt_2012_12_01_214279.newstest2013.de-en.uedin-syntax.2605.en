The word "right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is controversial.
The Egyptian president not saved with pathos.
We must create the transition.
"And it is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, in particular, as well as the Liberals, the Christian Copts, enlightened Muslim and secular fuels.
For all of them have hopelessly divided in a confused opposition are afraid.
Fear of God state along the Nile from grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said that Mohamed Morsi almost entschuldigend temporarily curtail the powers of the Constitutional Court, and expanded his powers, "in order to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles that dominated by the Islamist 100-member Constituent Assembly as a nightly, 15-hour Parforceritt were rushed through, some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also says in the draft, the case law based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is "principles"?
It was and is subject to interpretation and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the attendant legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
It will be held at least a newly guided article near: In all issues relating to Sharia should consult the Al-Azhar University, the country's main Islamic institution with great power throughout the Sunni Islam.
It is not, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which would result in de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Many in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also problematic: Civil military jurisdiction should further maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule on the suppression of opponents.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The state should also, as stated in the draft, "" protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote their morals and values."
That is legally formulated so vague that state institutions with the help of this article could even control the content of film art and literature.
In other words, this means nothing other than censorship.
No article, by the way, explicitly prescribes equality between men and women.
It prohibits another to insult or slander the prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
What is an insult and how it should be punished, though, remains unclear.
The phrase "insulting people" should be banned is equally dubious.
Is there a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
Interpretation, like so much in the draft, the Morsi's signature before and after his words "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum.
"The revolution has returned."
The opposition has formed for weeks against the overwhelming power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to bring down the charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter leaning presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution "belong to the scrapheap of history."
He accused Morsi's supporters want to lead a "coup against democracy" via text messaging service Twitter.
"If the referendum he proclaims, we will go to his palace and oust him," said the opposition Jasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren is not punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not be trying to monitor, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to counter-demonstration, cautiously but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Bank in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafi attended and cried: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded by Morsi: "do the country!" and protested: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably have civil war provoked similar conditions.
Morsi's supporters apparently did not risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both proponents and opponents of the draft constitution would have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide through the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
The draft for a majority of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word 'rights is not even before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process should have gone until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because for him, and human rights are indivisible.
For this, he was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complained in the interview with AFP.
Morsi's expansion in all three powers in the state, the lawyer would resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Bringing to strengthen civil society, the president put them de facto aside," laments Saeda.
But a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels alone, also from the international community, the fight the ideological direction along the Nile viewed with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
It could be revenge.
A crowd at the Tahrir warns: "Your geb√§hrt a monster that you can no longer control."
