Petro nella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
It was always my biggest dream was to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once considered for the main temple of knowledge of the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester College in the late 1980s - there, I had intended to study history - I had my bags packed and brought about the first scandal of my life again.
My father broke out in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said, I would be gone, because I had a problem with it, that other students had sex in the adjacent room.
The author of A N Wilson said rogue, "I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because I was quite unusual name, or because I come from a private school.
We had harassed me for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment: My late father now Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher and I have been an advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right suffers from a similar pursuit.
The rising and organized hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection benefits the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College indicate they will personally attacked because of their political views, "often active in isolation and declared undesirable."
They call for a place in their college equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
The situation was exacerbated by a recently-tra aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, bright and on the Right," was the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It was shown, among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and occupied with silver suit and silver Gehstock protzte.
At other universities, conservative students say they are viewed as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, was left in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing trend in universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without having met us at all. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "embarrassing." the 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect the Conservative Student Association of Oxford says that it has observed a growing hostility toward students at JCR members of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first week in Oxford, I was part of such a minority.
I was a very shy 18-year-old arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted to give an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester-week, in which new students get to know yourself and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors the mockery of Tory students not only facilities, but even pleased took part.
Political issues such as a cut, the rejection of the government and the privatization of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found its way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
I was in my first event French texts translated into English from the 18th century on what should come next, I had not been caught.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled there.
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and quite invidious.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?," he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few French hours in your free time - in other words, if you are not too preoccupied with your social activities," soup like Pitt.
Back in my room, I returned with hängendem head.
On this evening, I sat alone in college at dinner, when I typed someone lightly on the shoulder.
It was the second year of a German student named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory is harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your dad is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first semester pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to distract me.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all counts.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, a conservative force had attended Eton College, said to me: 'You're the daughter of a fascist pig. "
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was dirty and perverse.
"As Tories sex?" asked me one.
To beat each other, isn't it?
I felt like homosexuals had to have felt before the liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I like-minded people can meet only after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me were extended to my inner eye to a purgatory of isolation and ostracism.
Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, was the only tutor, which was open to recognize as a Tory, which had its headquarters in my college.
Not only was he hated for it to be a conservative, but also because he had written speeches for them and advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him narrow and parochial and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997, he adopted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will be not happy here," he told me.
I started to move between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge on more sensitive friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the taken all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
Such a thing would never do not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends was always impeccable manners on the day.
Marred his moist eyes.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I am sure you only neckt thee.
It would break my heart if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakening.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and relinquished his convictions.
In the following week, another history tutor during a Tutoriums seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly in shame zerging, my parents gave me that I had undergone a "brainwashing" and called it "old idiot."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who was the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave my Häscher.
When they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a wine fan tail slack.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer under such intimidation and mischievous nature in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university, which not only produced 14 Tory, but still hiding behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
