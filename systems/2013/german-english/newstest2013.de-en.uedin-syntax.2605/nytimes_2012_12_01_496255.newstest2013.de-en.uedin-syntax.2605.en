In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the southeast of Colorado for a crime to justice, will soon be legal in this state, the possession of a few chunk marijuana and a pipe that he smoked it.
Orozco said that he and some friends were in a car with it in third when they were stopped on the road near the border with Kansas.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for the possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, are excusable peccadilloes, each equipped with a penalty of $100, and received a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But he is also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, depends on the answer in hundreds of drug-related crimes less by the law than from the location.
Hundreds of the offences which will turn to marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures, has been dropped.
The police authorities have adults over 21 years for possession on a small scale. This is legally permitted, once the new laws take effect in the next few weeks.
But in the more conservative districts of Colorado prosecutors have promised to follow up on existing marijuana offences and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time voting in several cities, from the Denvers suburbs to the Western Mountains to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. 2002, chief of police in Aurora, which lies to the east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington scratch at the head at a loss.
They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of December 1, 2013.
In Washington, it believes that, in any case, Colorado is ahead of most states regarding the regulation of marijuana. There, the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for private domestic consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore suitable for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Insurance for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, known as I-502, enters into force on December 6 and is also the end point is a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practical issues have to be resolved at this time - about how the government target of a "reasonable access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops should be agreed within 300 metres in schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"nowhere, it will be difficult to find a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed group.
On 21 November sent an e-mail, chief market its employees in Aurora, in which he said the prosecutor would no longer pursue people over 21 years in minor marijuana offenses, and that the police will seek "immediately" show no penalty for this offense.
Chief market added that the police will continue to enforce urban targets for the regulation of medical marijuana growers and traffickers continue to be pursued.
In Weld County north of Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he was at his office would continue to monitor cases of marijuana possession, mainly to persuade consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for the possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana on trial, although many have been prosecuted for other crimes.
"Our agency has an obligation to pursue violations, in which it was the sentencing issue was crime," Buck said in a statement.
Even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, the reactions are ambiguous.
The police in Grand junction, the largest city of the district, is no longer in the possession of small quantities for adults.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported that decision, but also decided to drop proceedings have not all outstanding.
"I do not believe that I waste my time to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions across the state encouraged a profound dilemma in view of the large green experiment among local officials.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendant in court for marijuana offences and acts as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for the legalisation that they still cannot accept," he believes.
The first states to deal with small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as a national sample of cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials prepare for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the Federal Government, which the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several spectacular more arrests of consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser of the Obama Administration believes that investigators probably will happen no doors to confiscate small amounts of drugs, but may be reluctant to condone the legal under the new legislation, government-regulated marijuana shops.
Several towns in Colorado are just not waiting for the federal authorities act.
Even before election day some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana-shops, although they could open only in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a town in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone at the federal level, and then have a huge problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this legislative amendment.
We do not then and then for what the community has decided to what the government has decided.
There are many questions unanswered.
