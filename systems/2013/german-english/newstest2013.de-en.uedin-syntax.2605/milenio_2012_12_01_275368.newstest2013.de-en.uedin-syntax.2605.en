"South America has to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans "during World War II and in other clashes killing" and "today are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which drive the Unasur's member states.
"must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
The president of Ecuador advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who signed the Agreement of San Jose on human rights.
The teach never commit to something, and in return we sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and financed by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, in Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, was granted.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights" would be met.
He added that there have been "justified suspicions at the time that Assange extradited to a third country and its procedures were not followed."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary have demanded of him, put him on its territory during an interrogation subject for an alleged sexual offence, "the Swedish law that would have allowed beyond the Embassy of Ecuador in London via a video conference can be executed."
Correa said that the danger that would affect the health and mental condition of Assange.
"Ever since he is located in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not serious," said the head of state of Ecuador.
It was, however, the risk that he might take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises carried out in the open.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted in the Embassy of Ecuador in London for the month of June, the granting of a free briefs, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of Europe's Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities to find a solution for the captive founder of WikiLeaks, he stressed that there have been talks with London.
We do not act with human rights, we do not address this word for this case, there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, highest Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European bodies," he said.
And "if Britain morning granted the licence, has done so in my opinion."
And, if Mr Assange in Sweden, the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype interrogated, as it allows the Swedish law and was made in other cases, the problem is finished.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that he will not tolerate "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie to deny freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are bad, not the evil and corrupt politicians, journalists who are seeking profits and blackmail," he said.
In this sense he congratulated themselves that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and neither of the bankers or spit and hegemonic bourgeois countries," and took a re-election in advance that he "will deepen the revolution to continue to move in the right direction."
Correa also backed the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body should be "must be firm and held no opportunism and not legally faired coup," because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The president of Ecuador is also the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and in the wake of the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua before told to negotiate with Nicaragua in the maritime border between the two countries, for "absolutely right."
At present, this verdict is not implemented.
It is a problem between South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the quest for a common path.
They have to be dealt with comprehensively, so that you can overcome them and look to the future.
As he confided to a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, and said that "it is right in Latin America, call the international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he was a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, to reach his third mandate in a row, he indicated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of joy and optimism, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that he would retire from political life, to lose the elections in February 2013.
Power has never interested me personally, but in this unjust circumstances as in Ecuador that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was there, the likely victory guaranteed, so I must live up to that responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last term as president, and then draw me back from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is firm," he said.
Correa was also related to the treatment of health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, he told me that he had visited for a routine, planned treatment, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
"It is in no way a relapse in the health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian leader took today in Lima on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure a sustainable advance, equality and security.
