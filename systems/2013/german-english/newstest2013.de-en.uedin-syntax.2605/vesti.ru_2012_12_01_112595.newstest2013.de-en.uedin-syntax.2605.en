Born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or killer asteroid collision.

In order to save the human race, the important question is how we can breed in the weightlessness or on the spare planet?
Many choices do not exist in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could live at least hypothetically.
"namely Mars and Venus," Vladimir Surdin says the scientific staff of the Sternberg astronomical Institute.
While the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, however, has a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be in high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The question of reproduction in space, the researchers treated first in terms of the flora.
A half-century before that have already been carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit differed not in the least by the alien species.
The breeding of insects, followed closely by tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It is a normal chick.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chicken must find its footing; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems ran, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground on the chicks beat wild.
Ten hours later stumpften fully from the instincts of a newborn.
The chicks do not respond to light and sounds.
They just died four days later.
"twice we left chicks hatch and keeps the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychew stuck to the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding kennel with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, it will be located on the "Bion" Biosatelliten only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilized sent into space.
In principle, it was found nothing special.
"That was just with the Biosatelliten, but again, it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue," said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing space rats got offspring.
The issue of reproductive directly in space, we have not solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are being ripped from their natural habitat, simply cannot follow their reproductive instinct.
Unlike animals could be the man as a matter of principle.
Homo sapiens is capable to abstraktem thinking and can generate a similar emotional backdrop.
For ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was for Tereshkova.
The most important possessions that humanity has is the female body.
The gull flew away, and no one on Earth could answer the following question: It is about the space flight?
After this flight, they can bring a child into the world?
"Finally nobody answered the question," said veteran guard Tang Watschnadse space.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, a cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 came the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja twice was in orbit, and even work outside the space vehicle Nighthawks, a son.
Nevertheless, it remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonaut with which, after long flights, everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Poljakow, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet the human race needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and create artificial gravity.
The hydraulic laboratory in the cosmonaut preparation center is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.
The cosmonaut routine win here in a state of flux for the work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults water perceive as pleasant, it is a foreign environment, but babies have water as a natural element.
It is as if the small store Ichtyander testimony from that life in the country rose to the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can more easily get used to water.
In principle, that is logical, because from birth until the first swimming take just two weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While the weightlessness for a newborn child is so much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness the pelvic and abdominal muscles is extremely fast back and thus also takes the ability to extract the child.
Well, we treat the birth of a senior aid.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber in order to squeeze the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung feel, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be set as an adult for training in a pressure suit in orbit.
It is simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment that we make together, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will mean that we will get a disability, a perfect unangepassten people to the world," says the director of the Bioethics Commission ran, Igor Pestow, ahead of the Institute for medical and biological problems.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is just a theory.
At some point, it will be a reality, when the people in their space ships leave on a distant planet, which is a home for their offspring born in space.
