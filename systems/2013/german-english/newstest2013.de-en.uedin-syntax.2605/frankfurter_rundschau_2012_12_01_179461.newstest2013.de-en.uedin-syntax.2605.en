The story of a connection to overcome much more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the feeling: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, pumps Ladies and gentlemen slipper on the parquet floor search to find the beat him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then emerging slowly in the voices of singers, soprano, ALTO, tenor, bass, lobby, greeted and follow up.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, makes it almost from its plastic shoes, even if it brings together with its sleek wild gestures.
It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg rehearsing the choir Imbongi a new song.
About fifty singers come between 23 and 69 years old, of human genetics, until Haussmann.
"om" Obani "is no easy piece, every voice choir has a different text and that even in a foreign language, Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
To help themselves
There are about 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide, estimates that UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on Aids Bekämfung.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Living in Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in Esitjeni village, the association has found Voices for Africa Friend in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child education money, school uniforms and a hot meal each day in the Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means to Zulu storyteller or even Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language fluently speak can sing, but nobody in this room.
For nearly ten years, the choir songs in this strange soft language and brings them from time to time and then back to where they originally come from, in the south of Africa.
Because air line from Heidelberg, 8 733 kilometers to the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents because they impose the hi virus.
In Esitjeni shows the kids that all Swaziland suffers: High HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male foreskin restrictions that can be reduced by half the risk of contagion will hardly be accepted by the people.
More than 40 percent of the people of Swaziland, the immunodeficiency virus in terms of dying with mid-30 is not uncommon.
In a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, discovered the choir of the village, in particular, saw the Imbongis many children at all, but simply on the streets, which not only lacked parental responsibility: Food, clothing, education.
Without a school in a poor country, it is certainly no chance.
In the beginning there was the personal commitment of individuals for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a hot meal a day.
But a year later founded the choir Esitjeni care for AIDS orphans in the club "Voices for Africa" almost professional since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
STI are frequent viral hepatitis or Talis salacious Humane Pappilomaviren, HIV, herpes.
Felt itch and lice are among the parasite STI.
Who are the most vulnerable groups?
Syphilis and Tripper come especially among men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of Germany reported syphilis cases transmitted by sexual contact between men.
When the dan Candidose (mushroom), Humane and Tripper Pappilomaviren frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases, chlamydia infections are heterosexual adults.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively small, however, accounts for about 20 percent of HIV infections in this group.
Chlamydia infections among young people are far more often than other groups.
After three quarters of all infections affect European surveys young people aged between 15 and 25.
Here are also frequent Humane Pappilomaviren among young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all the reporting obligations are sexually transmitted diseases.
The number of syphilis infections more than doubled in 1697 disease in 2001 at 3698 diseases from the Robert Koch Institute in 2011.
The number of new infections of HIV-goes back since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
The symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease?
The infections can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints to urinate, prayed with abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unknown.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but offer no 100 percent protection.
Partly because pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infection and narrow-body contact.
So experts recommend especially for frequently changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups.
Diagnosed early most STI cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir throughout Germany ersingt comes a lot together.
"Overall, we have already sent about 200 000 euros after Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself manages Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive strong woman, the money from Germany.
She also cares about the orphans are well under at one of the grandmothers around.
The Gogos, how on Zulu calls the old women, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans in itself to give them a roof over your head and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear every day on time to the school.
Nobody has to come to the protection House Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as the two cooks cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa" has also launched a sewing school, organized jointly with the American health organization PSI and built two chicken houses that make many in the village have an HIV test.
That cannot be taken for granted, for obvious as the disease across the country is dead, they prefer to remain silent.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
King Mswati III, the last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned lifestyle that the hi virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms are on every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but the rarely used.
The culture is different - flesh-to-flesh. "
In order to promote the cultural exchange, travels the Imbongi choir every two or three years together with the South African and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, black self-esteem and confidence, which many at the southern tip of the black continent remaining from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of albacore, sing the songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings joy and mood, but has also been some fierce border soldiers a few tears off defies.
The trip is always after Esitjeni, where the singer visit their children.
Even if you find the small village on maps, in the valley of the River Ezulweni, it is more than aware.
"Whereas after Esitjeni, because the light is" tell the people there.
And if the kilometre 8733 airline returns to Heidelberg, to the pounding singers in the rehearsal room on the old road, then it will also shine there.
