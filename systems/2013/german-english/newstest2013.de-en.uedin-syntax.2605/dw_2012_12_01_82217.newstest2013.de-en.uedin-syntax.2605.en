Szabo, "German must play a greater role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin that balances on a thin diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza does not.
Now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, must be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence, without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany is also abstained when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
That is because it is precisely his foreign policy shift away from the policy, which has been managed by the United States, in the direction of German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans find themselves trapped in the middle.
One expects them to play a more independent role, but that are not accustomed to.
I think they fumble is still approach their roles, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy than specifically from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, so from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different than those of other major powers and, to a certain extent Germany must protect its interests.
These interests have had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not alienating the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would not even want to attach too much weight, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, while it has abstained from important decisions, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps it will play Germany so that even some respect.
Because it signals that it be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for a veto.
There are some differences between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly probably has quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot defend this position in public, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy course.
Find it difficult in Germany, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side to agree?
I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
They just do it with the euro.
I believe in the future will play a leading role in Germany, Europe to push for a European position.
Of course, that is not easy for Germany, even for the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think that the Germans understand that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as a major international player - Germany wants to play a major role at all?
Or is the lead of Germany still difficult?
Germany is not yet accustomed to that is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still find it hard to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, because every time Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German feelings are free.
That makes it not easy to the Germans.
This is the old problem: You don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to their neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics continuously from the EU to fill this vacuum at the moment but not who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like, it is inconvenient for them and makes them even more unpopular, c'est la vie!
