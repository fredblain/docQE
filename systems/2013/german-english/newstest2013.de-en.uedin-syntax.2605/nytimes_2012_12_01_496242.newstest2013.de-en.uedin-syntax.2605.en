In a world of constant elektrisierten, it is nice to be bored at times
This Thanksgiving I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane unexpectedly failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about boredom.
I will not lie.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight that is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping is available.
But more and more academic and child development experts lead to boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us, and our children, to be bored at times.
So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, which promotes creativity.
And because most of us today almost constant stare at a screen or another, we will no longer serve the benefits of boredom.
We should therefore welcome with open arms the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
This brings me back again.
Like many people, I always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada is the problem that has been discussed and boredom defined in many ways.
After a long reading of the presentation of the idea in a focus group of about 100 people and research literature Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience, "to be able to do a satisfactory job, this is not".
Boredom is different from apathy, so that the person is not busy, but this would be.
At the apathy, on the other hand, there is no need to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of the process of attention, coupled with a bad temper and a sense that time passes slowly."
You can almost hear it as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that could be related to these two states, bored people see the problem in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves and their surroundings.
Sometimes, we believe that is boring to us, even if we just have problems, focus on.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention" - in English: "The idle minds: The definition of boredom in the context of attention," which appeared in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science "in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point on an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a tape in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television program from the neighboring area that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group never heard this noise.
The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to concentrate, wrote to the difficulties of boredom and could find no reason for this.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, however, you put a dreary activity, "as the search for defective products at a factory conveyor, can distract music and help to feel not bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that can fight Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people remain physically attentive.
Studies have shown that children keep herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still, "said Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually dull - my late flight, a dröhnender loudspeaker, a particularly ermüdender film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "vulnerability" scale for a long while.
On the scale are statements such as "Many things I need to do to repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, Stephen Vodanovich, especially as regards the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quite a guyed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents contacted seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and in doing the homework, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3 percent of parents surveyed feel to bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increase or decrease.
He is sure, however, that "the young people perceived to be very boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Are you healthy?
Sometimes not because, in the extreme case, it meant that people take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many writers and philosophers study the relationship between creativity and boredom. This view is Professor Vodanovich researched the issue for more than two decades.
"With the boredom is the brain a saying that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain do not always know exactly what you do best.
If one is boring and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But television can have feelings of happiness in the short term, this flux but again in the long term.
A bored child is an iPad is enough, it can stop this from the boredom. However, it has not learned to maintain itself, or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Even if we do not see too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to get away from the constant activity and technology also casting home.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more boring, but boredom is the relentless nagging desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth is looking for a way to unwind and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated, find it hard to deal once the noise is silent."
