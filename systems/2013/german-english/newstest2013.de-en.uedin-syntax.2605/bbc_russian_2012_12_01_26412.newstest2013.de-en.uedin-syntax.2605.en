In the past few days came across the United States to massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains like Mc Donald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will swell further, or whether they will soon return to the air.
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist organizations.
In addition to the increase of modest wages of the organizers of the protests following simple Walmart- and fast-food workers to form unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly union.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the millions of customers, the so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States Ausverk√§ufe four that sometimes to Handgemengen led.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, down their work and his along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targets are low and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart stores, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Why buy a lot of Walmart-employed only slightly paid at the workplace.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can sell the goods often only as good as the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain about severe conditions, such as a lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the protest on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the contribution for the operation of their own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employees, earned 9.5 U.S. dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company raised the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost 3.2 billion dollars Walmart.
This is about 1.1% more than they donate to pay now.
Walmart would fully popped the wage increases to the customers, every purchase they cost only 46 cents more in the future.
A year would be the only 12,39 dollars for more spending compared to today.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that it only came to protests in nine states and that the company made no losses.
The Black Friday took the next day in his shop from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, and during this period, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart-funds on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of left-wing banks post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees laid down the work and the protest action merely "another PR stunt" was the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York on where their goal but not Walmart stores, which are not desirable and so far lacking in this progressive city, but McDonald's and others were inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sell billion portions, and yet to be granted unto you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work.

The minimum wage is currently under federal and New York law at $7.25 an hour.
At fast food restaurants, the minimum wage will be increased gradually, but not too much, and received an average $8.90 an hour their simple employees in New York.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to manage in New York with so little money is beyond me.
There was once a time when nearly a quarter of all American youngsters after school stood behind the counter at McDonald's, however, the young people still live with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people complain that they have to manage with that wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, which began at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue on Thursday, demanding that the cooks and cashiers get a minimum wage of $15 an hour of fast-food restaurants, which represents more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They also demanded the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The American law bans corporate management to stand in the way of that goal and admonish or fire union members.
On the other hand, the management is not easy for them.
But the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
There have been vocal protests on that day and in many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats said, including City Council member Jumaane Williams said: "McDonald's says that it sell billion portions, and yet to be granted unto you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support fast-food employees so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.
According to The New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the ground, not all of which by far are employed in the fast-food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize all mass.
