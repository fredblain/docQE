"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season with PSG have taken on a new dimension.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players are coming.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff has given me too much.
These elements spur me every day to improve my game level.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything is very fast.
But I do not suspend in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Jeff...
This summer's newcomers are accustomed to carry games to very high levels.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
The result is that a player as I must provide the forehead and wants to do his best.
It gives me Carlo Jeff a lot in terms of my game position.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Jeff is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Jeff instills respect all the technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think of the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon have taken the place of the top rider.
But we lurk in the ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: In this way we have qualified for the first knockout round.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as much as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First, we want to be first in our group before Porto, so that we can fight the return leg of the eighth final home game.
The PSG can be a great European club in the short term?
He has already had the budget for that...
To be a great European club has to win the Paris title and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG the resources so that this project is taking shape.
It would be a huge failure, not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case during the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really close to our hearts, that title match.
During the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough for the victory.
We have finished the season with a strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be masters with 79 points.
But those of Montpellier, another team, has made an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux contending for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
If, however, we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and it still is something that one can accuse us, this is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win 4-0 with every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
Look at Manchester City, an association of the last two seasons fails to qualify for the first knockout round, and made the huge expenditure.
In view of the sums invested believed you break the game with 15 points ahead.
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well during the last season, were made by this new PSG "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be the smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, it speaks of a "real-dependence".
That means that this season is powerful and shoots many goals.
He has therefore come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has reminded that he is a great player and a world star.
We respect both the player and the person within the team.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How do you experienced with the French national team's Euro 2012.
As a disappointment.
It was very important to me to participate in the European Championships.
Unfortunately, it has prevented me from my injury, beat out a season.
I have seen things there, from which I am stronger.
Today, I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This was my hope with the "Bleus" since my inauguration.
From what we have learned our lesson and now we need to show exemplary behavior, occurred in Ukraine.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by he had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that the "Bleus" Didier Deschamps will lead to Brazil.
This is forced draw in Spain on October 16 (1: 1) an opening game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used for everyone else.
Before that meeting in Spain, I have never seen a comparable game in my career.
