The start of the course, who studied the "end of the world."
The students examine every week apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, when religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of "long count backwards" in the Mayan calendar on December 21, from which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the next two months: The destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have described as "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste Semester that has ever occurred," said Charmé this week the students at Rutgers University-Camden, New Jersey.
If someone analyzed what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor of this semester, which ought to be the last in history, "offers courses on the" end of the world.
In the course of Temple gives beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker "media, culture and the end of the world."
The students examine every week apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which offered hypothetical scenarios that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear materials could come into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war break out.
This month analyzed the students studied films with apokalyptischem content and how they compare in comparison with real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is likely to be credible, possible and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, a professor of Latin American history and his colleague Amara Solari, a professor of art history and anthropology beisitzende formed a team to offer a course with the simple title "The End of the World".
"We are not in 2012, so that we can always retain the option to re-organize the course, in the event that the world does not go under," said Restall.
Despite the imminent downfall must study the students create projects and attend graduation exams.
The final examination is conducted on the eve of the apocalypse in Penn State, which is why the students have no other option than to "continue to work through the night, which claims the world comes to an end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more seats," said Restall on its course for students with a high average, which is filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester we received e-mails from students asked if there are seats available.
For its part, the students say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, religion and sociology from age 64 for a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really only a matter of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student nursing and psychology for Will Wekesa said to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a classroom, where it will be informed," he gave in.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed, rather than just a professor, said, to believe in the final date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayans, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society, which brings back several centuries, as people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"elsewhere people do not think so," he says.
This is essentially the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at the University of La Salle, who teaches this year in the Philippines, responding quickly to the question of whether he would have "a course on the" end of the world.
"The Philippines is not involved at the end of the world," he wrote as a hint to an exception of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days from the last court has been discussed over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people immediately think of a new date," or about philosophy, that the 21st of December is the beginning of a seven-year period, that would be the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they want to go about "the end of the world" celebration.
"Maybe I call a few friends, so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
