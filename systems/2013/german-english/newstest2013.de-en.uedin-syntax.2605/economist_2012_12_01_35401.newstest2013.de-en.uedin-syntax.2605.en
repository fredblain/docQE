Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.
Amid the usual blame countless buildings to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza hit near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict changes the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally find the end of it.
A war that is neither lost nor gained
At first glance, optimism in the face of the current situation seems anything but appropriate.
Even if the truce agreed on 21 November continues, this week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have the Israelis pushed back, although his group even large losses.
Although the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip and killed several Hamas leaders in one of the most desperate and densely populated corners of the planet will be locked up, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah wins.
And the Hamas leader could conclude that they have time on their side.
So, as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas is rich and powerful friends can draw on their side.
Turkey, a regional power, a revival, which once regarded as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken the side of Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe Israel is an Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, to Syria, where rebels could be an increasing number of Misti scissors before Stürzung Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, the country is by far the strongest and most important Arab inhabitants, especially on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance in the region.
The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, Hamas verschwägert and their leaders with the Brotherhood is more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove to be Hamas as a player who cannot be excluded from Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, however, have an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no more danger.
Many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed and the Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome," has to prove its worth.
At least for a while, Israel can sleep quietly.
Keep in diplomatic terms the United States steadfastly stuck to its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest violence escalations.
Israel has been well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a great extent.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, the country remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the Sperranlagen run into the bulk of an eventual Palestinian state in the West Bank and that they will protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared contrary to international law, but continued to expand.
Netanyahu is good because his Likud Party, in the run-up to the elections on January 22 under Avigdor Lieberman, allied with a group of RISC Herengracht still fighting.
Why this nanny behind cunning Palestinians and left to their own state?
If they really had control of the West Bank, were it not just as their supporters in the Gaza Strip fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish, if you dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps it will be able to enforce the hardliners. But the Arab Spring may make them a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will focus first on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in the overhaul of its economy.
For the pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama set to achieve a cease-fire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
The Israelis also should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue to deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg that undoubtedly will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus in Tel Aviv this week exploded.
The repression undermines the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
Over the years, bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly calling for its diplomatic tribute.
Both sides need a push from outside
The answer is that, by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and will be represented by this newspaper: Two states, in which Israel surrenders areas for security purposes.
The small for the near future hope is that the cease-fire gives more power to enforce this solution to outsiders.
Egypt must now work with Turkey and Qatar is better positioned than ever before, and stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip to Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by exchange and a common area of Jerusalem, to convince.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
That would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama also needs to do its share to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he missed the idea of its own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were equally unwilling to participate in it.
But this is a regrettable, myopic perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
