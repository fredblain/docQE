Interior ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons in crimes very low
The Russian Ministry plans a tightening of the arms bill for private gun owners.
The authorities to respond to the recent events: Injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the punishment of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police will ban the use of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The chairman of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, has supported the proposal and promised that the changes to the weapons law will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "attraction of the screws.
An open letter was published on the Internet, its author, representatives of various weapons associations, call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless" aggravations.
The percentage of registered gun crimes is very low, said the road cheeky activist, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior were 142 crimes committed with the use of weapons in the course of six months recorded in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that private gun owners for a tightening of the law will not deter criminals to serve on the black market.
At the moment, you can find every possible weapon for little money, according to the authors, in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Home Office said that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From the factories to the officers
The weapons reach through multiple channels on the black market.
There are five main channels, Viktor Baranez tells a former colonel, was active in the Education Ministry and the General Staff of the ten-year period.

The first channel is the army or the military, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons, the vigilante will be stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that these are weapons that were stolen from both chambers from the arms of the police force and directly by employees of law enforcement agencies.
Further illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals.
For many military camps often came to explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases was arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Make a contribution to the black market under Baranez arms manufacturers.
"Today there are countless private arms factories that do not meet the international competition and therefore the weapons dump under the hand on the black market, not only in Moscow," the expert said.
The smuggling is another channel of the black market.
In particular, many rifles and pistols come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is one of their own, some small-scale production, as well as a mafia that organized the smuggling," explains the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated how much each of the five channels has roughly to the delivery of the black market in illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was submitted by the Centre for problem analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal State Statistics Service, American literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal arms comes from the army and the legal protection authorities, according to investigators.
Half of all weapons on the black market are going through the "guilt of those found in their work to do with weapons," the report states.
According to the researchers, the data come from 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% from illegal excavations.
A sales manager of a store of weapons, does not want to be named, assured that weapons found at illegal excavations dreams about buying because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to obtain a weapons cache in the supply.
She bought a weapon, for example, a TT-type gun.
The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence.
"The retailer sells them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines and puts the weapon in the city," he told
"The police know, of course, know about everything and, therefore, if they cannot meet the plan to the discovery of crime, periodically check purchases by traders who offer illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"As the luxury shop."
Buyers and sellers are most often about friends to each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs, when someone became aware of me and I proposed to reach the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me that would go to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.

"In order to get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the technician. "I have a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go out and find themselves with a code as "Ivan melt of potassium, lithium, and scandium chloride, the target that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am now even in some key rings on a friend that I trust.
He gives me the key rings also is only because he knows that I don't verpfeife.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he wrote an article on the subject.
The schemes have not changed according to him.
He got a photo album, in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like in luxury goods," recalls of military personnel.
The buyer gets loud Baranez rather than a pig in a poke can try everything.
I buy a potential customer rather than simply drive the seller in the forest, and there is a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
