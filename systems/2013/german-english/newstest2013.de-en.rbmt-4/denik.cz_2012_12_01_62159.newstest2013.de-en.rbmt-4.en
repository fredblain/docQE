Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about in little as a month the end of the world being supposed to occur?
That is one of those disaster announcements onto which we people jump so gladly.
With our band's The tap tap we rather make ourselves merry about that and say that we are the single band of the world which can gather sufficiently positive energy in order to stop the end of the world or to prevent.
In December you in addition realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present the project to our readers nearer?
It is a question of a national benefit performance which we plan already two years.
For that we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya-calendar whose end is in the morning predicted for the 21st December at 11:10 o'clock.
On the day in front of that, that is on 20th December, three concerts occur from 21:00 o'clock in Prague, Brno and Ostrava simultaneously.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be in about instance too the time at which on the Kiribati Pacific island that lies in a time zone about 12 hours before us the Maya-calendar ends.
From whom does this idea come?
Initially presumably of me, afterwards we organized the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
At in order to prevent the end of the world we would like to gather energy not only sufficiently positive but we would like to think also together with the public about in which state we hand over this world to our children once.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya-calendar we developed also a unique collection from shoe, T-shirts, bag and key supporter against the end of the world with whose purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people can also support us.
The band The tap tap has together with other interpreters in addition also the so-called hymn against the end of the world with the title "End of the world turns out" picked up.
Already today the hymn is open YouTube very liked. Will it ring out also on the benefit performance concerts?
As a matter of course, and very indeed at the end of, presupposed that everything bangs and the end of the world does not occur...
The hymn is supposed to be sung by all interpreters on all three concerts simultaneously.
In addition the hymns are transferred together in a direct switching by the Czech Television live.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomás Hanák, which plays also the central figure of the Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings along...
How did you come to the cooperation with both of them?
We co-operate also with further personalities of the Czech culture scene, which is associated with our realizing many benefit performances and concerts...
We make an effort for binding these people intensely into our projects.
It was proved in this case that most are interested at a cooperation with us, and have fun at that.
Which purpose do the proceeds of the concerts benefit against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the barrier-free training center Studeo which we work on already six years together with the association tap in the Jedlička-institute.
The pupils of the Jedlička-institute are looked after regularly by readers who help them in the case of different leisure activities.
Since the pupils themselves do not have the means in order to consult the readers, we would like to help them in this way.
In frames of the finishing of the Jedlička-institute an own building is supposed to arise in which we move in then with this project.
At every concert several groups and interpreters perform.
For which criteria did you select these?
We wanted to put together a program that speaks to all generations including child.
In Prague China skis, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform for example.
You find out everything further on the internet page www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned also for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prager spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would like to perform also gladly in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - when we are then in the USA already once - would connect this with appearances also gladly in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are just not small, up to now you are London already in Madrid, Brussels, or in Moscow occurred.
A group which consists of people with hindrances is The Tap tap, however.
How do you overcome these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are rotation chair drivers, that is the rotation chairs must be carried in the luggage hold. In addition we must drag along of course many instrument suitcases and other baggage...
Nonetheless it up to now always banged without problems, ČSA and British Airways were prepared always very much well that I was surprised sometimes in part already on us.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were not any problems.
Through your trips abroad you have a comparison as it looks in the single countries with barrier freedom as one deals with handicapped people there and so forth.
How did you experience these things up to now?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and further cities in which everything functions better than with us we were witnesses of that just in Russia, that in the east still everything is in his beginnings.
Opposite Prague Moscow is completely not suitable for use by the handicapped. There it is still unusual if somebody is in the rotation chair only in the city center on the way.
It is not even natural there yet that one lets to a rotation chair driver for example in the elevator.
Fortunately associations which attempt to refer to the problems of people with hindrances arise also there.
And in which respect must we catch up opposite the countries kept on being developed?
There are still many things in which we hang afterwards...
It is still to be said, however, for this purpose that an improvement of the situation ever depends on the bothering of the concerned persons.
In London and Madrid it is completely usual that also people with difficult hindrances move independently in the public room, into the museum go, be able to use toilets and so forth.
It is just not, however, usual that a larger group of handicapped people participates in the social event actively there, in that we are tap tap with the band The the west ahead of a little!
A thing is respect in public and barrier freedom, but only if from our rows significant sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come, the things will really start changing oneself.
Up to now these are only individual cases of especially will-strong personalities.
The Tap tap is currently very much popular. If we, however, go back a few years: What motivated her in the year 1998 to founding a band?
Then I started as an attendant in the Jedlička-institute, where I met many young people who were interested at that, occupying oneself with something intensely.
And since I am even a musician and play saxophone among other things, I founded a Music limited company together with a colleague.
Na, and with the time something got out of control that as our presenter, Láďa Angelovič, uses to say (laughs).
The band was confessed, however, only in the last years, or am I mistaken?
It is right that the cooperation with known singers helped us; in addition we also started advertising ourselves actively.
It became conscious to us that the own achievement does not exist if one achieves something and this is not to be seen there to the outside in certain sense.
Thanks to the EU supporting-money can we us furthermore good readers, high-quality devices and and similar things. achieve.
Was it your objective to bring it to Tap so far with The Tap?
From the beginning I sensed the potential, that one can approach the things differently.
In the show business one today often copies the other one.
That is logical in his way since all new one with caution is considered and accepted first after longer time.
There are only few really unique things, and I dare to say that Tap belongs to Tap for this purpose.
The first impression which the spectator has mostly is as a matter of course pity; that is only natural...
But this pity is completely superfluous because people with hindrances are not lonely and left beings who we would have to pity.
There are people who live a genuine life and can develop provided that they have the for this purpose necessary means.
I always say, that if people with hindrances succeed in something, that not only for them even a progress is, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a severe head as one hears about many people?
If one liked to make something good, one must not accept any compromises in many things and also a certain discipline must demand.
This is my opinion's, however, completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when find it then that they have the week of test twice, have to complete preparatory phases and transfer a lot of time onto concert journeys, then the enthusiasm ceases at many quickly.
So it functions, however, everywhere, in every band which wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently The tap has Tap twenty members.
How many of them were there from beginning at, that is since 1998?
Only an only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent that.
Who has the will and the pleasure in the taking part, is with us always welcome.
