"The large and powerful one" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While representatives and B端rgerrechtler are discussing about which benefit the law brings about obligatory language tests for migrants, criminals sell already forged certificates
Annually 13 million foreign workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
It is your only objective to earn money for the maintenance of the families remained in the home.
On 1st December a law according to which every work migrant must put aside a test which certifies knowledge of the Russian language came into force.
Up to now this regulation is valid only for migrants who want to work in the service industry, in the local housing association and in the retail trade.
However, the tests with the time are supposed to become the duty in the future according to Federal Migration Authority for all foreign workers.
In this case one must put aside not only language tests, but also tests into the Russian history and the basics of the legislation.
Language knowledge must be proved both for the receipt as also the prolongation of the work permit.
Exceptions are valid only for citizens of countries in whom Russian is official language.
Persons who received their training reports and diplomas in front of the decay of the USSR in the year 1991 are excluded also from this law.
Sense, problems natures and protection of the rights
The entirety of the examination places becomes under the aegis of the Pushkin institute for the Russian Language, the Russian university of the nation friendship, the Muscovites State university, the Sankt Petersburger State university and other Russian colleges'' stand.
The migrants can put aside the tests in all cities; already now already more than 160 corresponding centers were opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the representatives of the Staatsduma and the Federal Migration Authority.
B端rgerrechtler on the other hand introduced question following the coming into effect of the law in the press repeatedly: What brings the whole actually?
Which changes does it bring the regulation to have to show language knowledge both for the Russians and for the foreign workers?
Particularly, speakers reply to the migration authority, it goes around, to reduce the number the mandatory worker.
"A lot talk now about the protection of the rights of work migrants", the conductor of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew, says.
Your rights must already be protected, however, against their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Onto problems migrants without profession, education, language knowledge and medical appraisal push.
It is convinced by that to Sebelew that a future migrant without language knowledge will meet people unavoidably with bad intentions that put it into a dark, narrow hut under the pretense of help where it wait with dozens seinesgleichen months without Essen and documents and will slave 12 to 14 hours on day.
Many complaints of our migrants reach us.
"In the home one is promised to you, and with the case of the arrival you are deceived, you get their passports taken off and you do not receive the promised wage", confirms the conductor of the head office for work migration of the Tajikistani migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not chide, head!
Nevertheless many citizens of the Central Asian republics that want to earn their money in Russia add, that they not only not be able to master the language of the target country, but also their own language not show hardly in writing.
That is not natural so very much their fault, as rather the evil: Only few Turkmenen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford also only a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not yet even money in order to feed the children not to mention, to buy decent clothing, shoes and school things for them.
As teenagers these children seize then the first occasion for the money-earning immediately.
"It is difficult without language knowledge", they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
B端rgerrechtler accentuate concerning the law following important aspect.
Only migrants with legal status must put aside the test.
If you do not have this status, there are not so any examination and subsequently any official work.
Meanwhile the majority of the foreign workers keeps on staying illegally in Russia.
"Cordially welcome" or "Admission for unauthorized forbade"
Many migrants confirm that it is not simple to receive an official status in Russia.
Bureaucratic hurdles and of course the linguistic difficulties are the reason.
In addition the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
A forged registration can one fast and only for one and a half thousand do.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are most mainly forged and not registered we, and cases of blackmail arise from that then.
"You want one- or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow is expressed opposite journalists".
"Not only shun from any costs for wrong papers"
Already on the day at which the law came into force it turned out that only the registration documents of the migrants cannot be forged.
Some forged certificates that certify the completion of the language test were fitting-taken already from employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The forged papers were printed with a usual color printer.
Of course the new owners did not receive these for nothing: Every migrant who hoped for being able to spare himself the tests so paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
That is more than twice so much as the costs for the official test are: This costs a work migrant three thousand roubles.
Over the most important immediate task consisting in protecting the system against corruption so that the certifications can simply not be bought both office-bearers and B端rgerrechtler agree agreed to themselves.
For the moment the authorities can only promise foreign workers who fall through the test with the case of the first time that they receive time for a language basic course.
In addition places in fields in which no active communication with people is necessary are offered newcomers without language knowledge.
