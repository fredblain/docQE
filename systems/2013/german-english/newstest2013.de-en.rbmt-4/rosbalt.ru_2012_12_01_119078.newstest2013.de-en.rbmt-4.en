Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "inhabitant of St. Petersburg Avantgarde" that is dedicated to city-dwellers that form the avant-garde of the art and culture.
On the exquisite list already hochrangige representatives of the inhabitant of St. Petersburg art scene arrived, their successes about the borders of the city out go and that often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the one dressed in reds bearded, that one finds once near the Russian Museum, once near the summer garden, once at scene meetings or on Vernissagen.
Where always the pictures are also made out by Kirill Miller, big crowds lure her.
Kirill Miller is to one of the typical inhabitants of St. Petersburg social-philosophical artist, that create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a radiant personality of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the eighties and/or at the beginning of the nineties.
He is also a man of the city and conjures his fellow citizens a smile into the face through his presence on the street and guarantees with them for good mood.
Recently he grabbed himself a barrel organ and became the inhabitant of St. Petersburg Drehorgelspieler since he felt ready at last for this difficult role with regard to his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why you are actually always in reds and not for example in yellow or turquoise in the city on the way?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world red is the compromise between KÃ¼nstler, image consultant and Gesellschaft.
In the society all which differs from the grey norm a little causes aggressions and bad behavior.
I want to engage with the people in conversation, however, through my provocations.
Each of my last provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know that you must become painter?
- At an exhibition in the culture palace Newskij near which my works were exhibited.
I understood, that I must go this way.
Then ging the time of the free old ones, painter, however, officially not acknowledged then too end, and new and free painters as I were unintelligible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, therefore with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; "Puschkinskaja 10" arose from that, and then end was first once.
It pulls me to the theater, for the fashion, for the music, actually to all, except for the literature.
- And all the united one in your kind clinic... - it was important to me to stand in the center of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creating artists should meet.
In the year 1995 I filled a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and over there there was up to the renovation works a musical-artistic club for the Bohemia, the house of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember as cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for the playback track, narrow tricots supported and also the today announced composer Igor Wdowin belonged to them.
When the group started playing live "Leningrad" became from it.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began it, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the kind-clinic.
There our employees and regular customers went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000 there was in the press an inquiry in the case of which it was a question of the distinction "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the year", and in this way I had arrived at the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a human being of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the present time it is simple to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same one: One can be famous without achieving a cultural contribution in this way.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the current affairs and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the topic "The Russian museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Formerly I was social, but now it hurts and prepares fear, to be like this.
In a clown that all smudges and his tragedy loses.
I love the grotesque tale, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let's save for example the world in our dictating that everyone has to dress himself up complete.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothing and itself in an oriented way at the outside appearance and not at the interior of the human being.
However, maybe one must not give a human being the hand, but should spit to him into the face.
The delusion disappears by the dressing up.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A culture city should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can also commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of the cultures.
Formerly the people formed great groups: The bohemians loved the one and the simple nation the other thing.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult them all to like.
I am not a a hundred-dollar-note which everyone likes.
Now you must consider who will like you.
Now every cult star has about 100 supporters.
- Several thousands come to the appearances of Stas Michailow, however!
- Left women come to it, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 persons come and not 10 thousand, subsequently there is less management, money, and everything is ruined.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to deceive her and not to destroy the reached thing.
In my youth I painted such pictures which hanged even in a row with the works with a collector from Falk and Larionow.
I began with pictures which usually come first at the end of the career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It means: intellectual culture and consumption culture.
At all no culture has consumption, that is something very else.
I am a human being of the last culture and grew up with artists that lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.
That is the culture which I approve.
- Kirill, what Petersburg lacks?
- Good culture experts.
One says: Servant of the culture.
However, not everyone of them can deal with culture.
With the real czars it was different, because maybe the czars did not understand a lot from culture, understood, however, it that correct experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are at the present time good consultants.
In Peter castle we have the experts which could be, but the way is barred to them since one needs more hochrangigerer experts that evaluate the Ersteren correctly and clear them the way.
Now only the own taste counts.
The same one is valid for the Erarta, however with the difference that they say honestly, that they do not pick up all contemporary art and other museums must search some painters therefore.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the culture capital; in Moscow there are much more culture and a corresponding fertile soil.
On our stones art can grow up only heavily.
We need a cultural fertile soil, because have for example we in the meantime more writers than readers, and nevertheless that is not correct.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us those ones are little a lot.
Art must be again modern, so as at the beginning the former century's.
The project is financed to the city of St. Petersburg from subsidies
