A too late recognition is cause for a death because of Aids today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when one confirmed him the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck", he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis that the doctor without "weakening" recognizable success "attempted".
He hid it from his family.
He decided, to see only to his illness and began with finding oneself out of that; and this with such use, that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly to one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), into which it came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the humane Immundefizienz-virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hardly conceivable at the beginning of the nineties, when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more stigmata.
Then the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided it itself to say goodbye "because it led to a dead end-de-sac."
Then AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with living quality.
However, still many persons come into the clinic that does not know anything of their illness and that already caused the virus at those ones damage and that exhausted their immune system, and the victims of opportunistischen infections are.
"The great success means", 31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, that is after appearance of the first told cases, "today, that are exactly now the survival of a patient that incorporates the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population", the conductor of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, near which he said that this information in April of this year was supported by a scientific publication had a look at, declared.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented on the scientists concluding since the year 2008, AIDS not being indeed a death sentence, however, the years of the survival and the living quality of the degree of the influence of the immune system of the persons at beginning of the treatment taking off and that that greater chances would have, that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years a counting's of 200 CD4 and 50 years' with the case of a counting of 500 CD4.
Simply said, the above carrying out means, that, who in the age of 25 years the diagnosis keeps HIV-positive, in this sense "problem-free 75 years old can become as long as he is under surveillance" this specialist declared.
In order to be able to classify this progress correctly, must be reminded of the durability of the Mexicans today being on the average 76 years.
Even if the mortality has been reduced in the last years significantly (in Mexico the number of the persons which people die of AIDS reduced 4,862 to itself from 6,678 cases in the year 2007 in the year 2011 (Annual report of the ONUSIDA)), nevertheless it is correct that since the appearance of AIDS 60 percent of the patients registered in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 persons died in the year of 2011, and up to the month of May of this year it is already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there is universal access to the antiretroviralen drugs since 2005.
- Why do always people die therefore still of that?
- In my opinion the problem is not the access to the treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we had no supply problems near the medicines. The problem is that the persons come in far advanced state because they do not know their infection state that is in very late phases of the illness.
It does a beating statement: "Coming" to "nine of ten patients to us if they have already a concurrent infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, for which recognition tests must be offered to all persons with whom this is necessary massively."
The specialists and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee for the AIDS-avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio which made carry out his test near a private lab agree to this proposal, and this was that one for the only reason because a friend of it had done it in spite of his young age already in the AIDS-phase and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a crustaceous tumor) had what one of the usual complications is.
Everything is different if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and would not like to hear anything.
"When I must already die, burst more gladly then three times", one says in my case.
The change was to the there improvement, I eat well, do sport and take the medicines.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, as anyone else also.
"I work, undertake a lot, split up an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person, Fabrizio that agreed counts in order to encourage with his report those that today are afraid within the framework of the worldwide AIDS day his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO".
You should do the test if they belong to the risk group. Know ever formerly it whether they are HIV-positive, all the better, and when they already know the diagnosis, they are supposed to learn how one can live as all people responsibly.
His information is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the simple citizen big holes exist, declares Ricardo Salazar, journalist, from Guadalajara who took care of the thing of the HIV.
And the most important thing is the prevention.
At the places characterized to that "the distribution was increased from condoms in fact; formerly they were given separately, now they add parcels to us with a hundred pieces, which is already good, there are, however, still people who do not "have" any access to a condom", he said.
The young people belong to the risk persons for new infections.
"To what you need that one"? a spread mockery question of social workers, orientation personnel in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, is which young people would not like to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He suggested to inform this inefficient distribution again; the condoms are not supposed to be only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities to which frequently young people go.
The promiscuity is not supposed to be supported.
The beer and motel is not supposed to be paid to them as the governor Emilio González answered the question whether under his administration preservative would be distributed.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to familiarize those that carry out already a sexual activity" "with the condoms", it brought it onto the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state lies nationally seenly near 4th place of new and accumulated AIDS-cases, and near 13th place with respect to HIV.
92% of the contagion cases occur via sexual intercourse, 6% about the blood and 2% in a perinatal way.
It is reckoned that 50,000 persons with HIV live because there are 4 or 5 persons who do not know it for every registered case.
