After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a judgment which does not acknowledge the restructuring of the obligations of the group of Vitro which was achieved via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent is created for every national enterprise with subsidiaries in the neighbor country which has payment problems.
One could say therefore that the procedures for the survival of the enterprises which approve the Mexican laws do not have any validity in the country of the stars and Stripes contrary to international descendants.
In the practice that one leads on 15th June issued recognition of the judgment by the judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas to the Mexican enterprises of the seizure of their property being helplessly exposed to bravo beyond the river.
However, the decision opens for the tallest glass manufacturer in Mexico Tür and Tor in order to call the uppermost court of justice of the United States because of three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the thing is referring to the believers having to succumb to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit with seat in New Orleans says first of all that it is with the case of the main procedure of the commercial bankruptcy handled in Mexico a question.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures with the case of insolvency of enterprises with country-comprehensive profile is not known.
In fact the model law of the United Nations for the unification of the international commercial law with the case of which the American Law was used institutes as a mediator was created for this purpose.
Secondly the judgment determines that without the voices of the societies after recognition of the obligations in the bankruptcy mass which the branches of Vitro with their holding company had the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the obligations.
However, this possibility of the Mexican laws is acknowledged.
In fact Vitro is not the first case in which this pattern was approved.
There is half a dozen of examples, under that Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, who obligations were confirmed to the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal institute for commercial bankruptcies) under enterprises.
Correct is in addition, that to withdrawal of the voices of the branches the believers of Vitro, the believers that complained near the courts of the United States against Vitro, that is the vulture funds as to B. Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited would have reached, no majority.
The vote would be 45 percent gone out against 37 percent.
This is not considered by the court of appeal.
On the other hand it gives Vitro Schuld for his difficult situation 2008 within the framework of the great economical crisis in the United States that gave strokes to the country.
For this reason the family González Sada inserts contradiction before the same court of appeal through h so that the vote occurs in the plenum. of all judges, because only three of them voted.
That is not allowed to, if the Cerciorare-objection is made which requires the inspection of the procedure through a higher authority, in this case through the Uppermost court of justice of the United States.
The fatal thing at this case is, that the court let a document that was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the court) in which the procedure carried out by Vitro is described within the framework of the law about commercial bankruptcies, and in which refers to its having asked strictly the descendants signed from both countries in order to correspond to the chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States aside.
In addition refers to the country submitting itself to the principles to the commission of the United Nations for the international trade, that is the defined rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantees the equalization of debtor and believers.
Zweibandige Karambole: a stroke for Vitro and for the country.
