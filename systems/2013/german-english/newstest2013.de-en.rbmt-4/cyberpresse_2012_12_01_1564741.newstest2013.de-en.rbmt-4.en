Prostate gland cancer early recognition: the test should be done or not?
The PSA test shows in fact sometimes faulty results, with wrong negative or, however, also wrong positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger hesitation of the already irresolute men for the realization from early recognition tests.
The test should be done or not?
We obtained the opinion from two specialists.
With the case of the studies carried out in the USA numerous disturbances existed between the control groups so that it is difficult to interpret these data and to give unequivocal recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, came for the conclusion, that a difference with the case of the mortality of patients with and without early recognition exists.
This study also showed, that at a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years the probability of the education of metastases about 30 to 40% higher is, if no early recognition was carried out.
Therefore I recommend the test from an age of 50 years and/or 40 years if one has a direct relative who already had fallen with prostate gland cancer ill.
With men of afro-American origin also a higher risk exists.
The most important thing is to make the correct decision as soon as a cancer illness was recognized.
There are cancer kinds, that aggressive and others that are indolent.
The extent of the risk of his cancer illness must be made really understandable to the patient when the possible options with the case of which Prostatakrebse can remain untreated are shown him if it does not influence the living quality in the long term, and one rather decides for an active supervision of the illness in these cases.
Today no treatment occurs with many men with whom one recognized cancer since their cancer is not aggressive and does not represent any threat for their life.
One suggests an active supervision to them and offers them a treatment in the case of advance of the illness.
One determines the criteria for a decision with increasing accuracy, who should be treated and who not.
Therefore I recommend the realization of the test in spite of that.
It, however, is most important to speak with his doctor in order to determine whether it should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember developed an instrument with which it is possible that before- and to evaluate disadvantages of the PSA test.

Bend forward the illness
Unfortunately there is not any miracle means for the prevention of cancer.
In spite of the progress in the research the assumption of a healthy way of life remains the best way in order to reduce the risk at it fall ill.
It is reckoned that 30% of the cancer illnesses could be prevented if they all ate well and moved sufficiently.
"If there were not any smokers anymore, this value would go up at least onto 50%", stresses André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.
However, people go out from that that about 10% of the cancer illnesses through inheritance are caused.
Several remain also completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society the fight remains a priority against the tobacco dependence, in spite of the drop of the number of the smokers.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a factor of risk for several other cancer kinds.
It damages the health of the people strongly.
"Today still there are in Quebec 1.5 Mio. of smokers, the speaker André Beaulieu feels sorry.
Encouraging data: 10 years according to the renunciation of the cigarette, the risk is reduced at cancer to die around half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer society predominance and Adipositas support also the outbreak of the illness.
You seem the risk for Breast-, Transverse Colon-, Rectum-, to increase gullet, pancreas and womb cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity protects against transverse colon cancer during the entire life" he adds.
The feeding
The organization also recommends to restrict the consumption of red meat.
In too great amount it increases the risk, to fall with a wrath and/or rectum cancer ill.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preserving of meat through smoke-curing, drying or salt can lead to the education from carcinogens.
"The body cells can damage Letztere and lead it to the development from cancer", it declares.
Vitamins
In the last years several scientists examined the connection between vitamin additions and cancer.
Your investigations are currently not, however, conclusive.
After the Canadian cancer society the studies to vitamin E are inconsistent.
While a study was finding out the decrease of the risk from prostate gland cancer, another rather showed a rise.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was not shown clearly also yet.
In addition Mr Beaulieu shows how it is importantly to talk about his objections and his familiar preloading with his doctor.
"The realization of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer."
