In the USA fasting-Food and supermarket employees strike
Every fourth US American young person is sometime behind the cash box of Mc Donald's
In the last days it came everywhere in the USA to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fasting-Food-chains as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Nor nobody can predict whether the protests will swell still further or whether they already soon run out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
Next to the rise of the modest wages of simple Walm kind- and the organizers of the protests pursue fasting-Food employees the aim of founding trade unions.
Up to now this branch of the economy is not organized in a hardly union-related way.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, at the so-called Black Friday at which in the USA clearance sales that attracted millions of customers occurred, which now and then led to brawls.
On this day some Walmart-Mitarbeiter from which there is worldwide 2.2 million laid down their work and branches of the chain whose target group persons of low and middle income are picketed together with trade unions and left activists.
Walmart sells all products, of baby's napkins about hunting guns and car batteries up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart-Filialen is on average between 8 and 27% more favorable than in big supermarkets.
Therefore many of the insignificantly paid Walmart-Besch√§ftigten shop only at the own job.
The prices and the array of goods turned Walmart into one of the greatest enterprises in the USA.
According to critics Walmart can often sell the product so favorably only therefore because the employees are paid badly.
Latter ones complain also about difficult working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests at the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their annoyance over the contribution having increased from 30 for the factory-owned health insurance on 100 dollars in the month.
A typical Walmart-Mitarbeiter who earns 9.5 United States dollars the hour cannot afford this rise, they said.
Proving more brashly from the Californian university in Berkeley that it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars if the enterprise increases the average wage to 12 dollars the hour.
Those ones are approx. 1.1% more than they donate for wage now.
If Walmart would completely put down the wage increases onto the customers, every purchase cost her only 46 cents more in the future.
Per annum those ones would be for them in comparison with today additional expenditures only of 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart state in a satisfied way that it resulted in protests only into nine Federal states and these did not give any losses to the enterprise.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in his cases of 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total the Walmart-Kassen carried out almost 100 million transactions at the "Black Friday".
The speaker of the enterprise, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the web page of the left-wing Huffington mail office, that "less than in total five" Walmart-Mitarbeiter laid down the work and the protest action was only "a further" PR trick" of the trade union that organized the protests.
"Free cash box"!
The protests went on this week into New York, where their objective, however, not Walmart-Filialen (that does not want in this advanced city and that therefore are up to now inexistent), but McDonald 'it and other economical restaurants were.
McDonald 'it say, the enterprise sells billions of portions, and in spite of that one does not give you any sick person days, and you are not paid for your honest work!

Currently the minimum wage is according to federal and New York legislation near 7.25 dollars the hour.
In Fast-Food-Restaurants the minimum wage little by little is raised, not gotten, however, too strongly, and on average their simple employees in New York 8.90 United States dollars of the hour.
Less than they nobody deserves in this expensive city.
How it is possible to manage with so little money in New York is inscrutable to me.
There was once a time, in that one almost a quarter of all US American young people to the school with McDonald stood'it behind the bar, however, the young people still lived with their parents.
Hardly one saw the main source of income in that or intended to remain longer there.
Now meet me in the case of interviews with employees of McDonald 'it constant people that complain about their having to manage with this wage and feed even their children sometimes.
On the other hand there is Street journal in the forum of the newspaper rampart a comment that Verfasser says it is irresponsible to get children if one does not know as one is supposed to feed her.
The participants of the protests, that "began" on Thursday at 6.30 o'clock in the morning before the McDonald 'it in the 40th Street and in the Madison avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 United States dollars of the hour which corresponds to more than one doubling of the present minimum wage.
You kept on demanding the education from trade unions in the fasting-Food-branch.
The US American law forbids it the management to suit this objective in the way and to admonish union members off or to release.
On the other hand the management does simply not do it to them.
The foundation of trade unions in the fasting-Food-branch is, however, difficult also for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Dissatisfied ones
There were loud protests on this day also in front of many other Fast-Food-Restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a meeting at the noon in front of the McDonald 'it at the Times Square with which some local democrats spoke under that town council councillor member of Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald' it say, it sells billions of portions, and "in spite of that one does not give you any sick person days, and you are not paid for your honest work"!
The demonstrators were supported also by other prominent New York democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio that said that "we should support the fasting-Food employees common so that they receive a just wage and can achieve the economical prosperity that every New Yorker earns"!.
According to New York Times this was the greatest action of their kind in the history of the US American fasting-Food-industry.
However, only some a Hundred people from whom all in which in New York tens of thousands work are not busy by far in the fasting-Food-branch were on site.
Nor it is not to be foreseen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
