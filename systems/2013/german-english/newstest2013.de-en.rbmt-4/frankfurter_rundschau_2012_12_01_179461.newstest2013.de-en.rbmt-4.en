Weltaidstag: Stamp, to sing help,
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland Aidswaisen are pleased with that.
The history of a connection which overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First the stamping is there: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, lady court shoes and Herrenslipper search the time on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
Unity-two-three-four.
Then first the voices of the singers swell slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - badger, beguile and pursue.
And it almost lifts Fiete Hopf, the 29-year old conductor, from his material shoes if it combines her with his supplely wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi practises a new song.
Onto the fifty singers came, between 23 and 69 years old, of the humane geneticist up to the househusband.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choir voice also still has another text and this in a very foreign language: Zulu, that of eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland is spoken.
Help for the self-help
Worldwide about 34 million HIV-Infizierte there is, Unaids, the program of the United Nations to the Bekämfung of Aids, estimates that.
23.5 million people of them live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland 245000 Aidswaisen live.
Meanwhile more than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village Esitjeni the Voices for Africa association found godfathers in Germany.
70 of them a weiterführende school visit.
For 15 or 20 euros in the month one can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees school fee, school uniform and a warm meal to the child daily in the Gogo-center.
History narrator or also Lobpreiser means Imbongi in Zulu.
Nobody can speak the Bantu language fluently in this room, but sing it.
For almost ten years the choir is practising songs in this foreign soft language and it returns now and then also there, where they come initially: into the south of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers air line remote of Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swasiland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple loam and straw huts, children are a majority of them.
In more than 300 of them no parents have more because these succumbed to the HI-virus.
In Esitjeni it is proved on a small scale what Swaziland completely suffers from: highest HIV-Infektionsrate, lowest durability worldwide loud Unicef.
Curtailments of the masculine prepuce that reduces the contagion risk nachweislich around half are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland take the immune weakness virus into themselves, to die with middle thirty is not a rarity.
At a common Africa journey in the spring 2005 the choir discovered the village, vor allem, however, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets that did not lack only parental welfare but simple at everything: Essen, clothing, education.
Without graduation one does not have first right any chance in a poor country.
At the beginning it was still the private engagement individual to send a child to the school for a few euros per year and to make a warm meal for him possible on day.
However, already a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which takes care of the Aids-orphans since then almost professionally in Esitjeni.
Facts to sexually transferable infections
What are the most important sexually transferable illnesses?
Syphilis, Chlamydien and gonorrhea (Gonorrhö) number among the bacterial STI.
Frequent viral STI are HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Crab lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main concerned person groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur particularly with men who have sex with men.
The Robert-cook-institute assumes that at least four are transmitted through sexual contacts by five of all syphilis-cases announced in Germany between men.
With the heterosexual adults Chlamydien infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (Mushroom), gonorrheas and Humane Pappilomaviren are frequent occurring sexually transferable illnesses.
The circulation of HIV is comparably small among heterosexual adults in these parts - nevertheless: About 20 percent of the HIV new infections are allotted to this group.
Among young people Chlamydien-infections occur considerably more frequently than with the case of other population groups.
To European elevations three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years.
In these parts Humane Pappilomaviren occur furthermore frequently with young people.
How did the number of the infections develop?
Not all sexually transferable illnesses are orache-liable.
The number of the syphilis infections has itself according to the Robert cook institute of 1697 illnesses in the year 2001 on 3698 illnesses in the year 2011 more than duplicated.
The number of the HIV new infections goes back since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That is about instance a tenth less before than per year.
Which symptoms refer to a venereal disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital organ field, complaints during the Urinieren, outflow, lower abdomen pains as well as bubbles or warts.
Often they cause, however, no pains or other symptoms and remain therefore unnoticed.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of a contagion, do not offer, however, any one hundred percent protection.
Because partially exciters of sexually transferable illnesses can be passed on also through grease infections and narrow body contact.
Therefore experts recommend regular investigations particularly with sex partners changing frequently.
Early diagnoses can most STI cured and be avoided late consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the fees, that the choir in whole Germany ersingt, some comes together.
"In total we sent already about 200 000 euros according to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the chairperson of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and enforcement-strong woman, administers the money from Germany.
She also sees to the orphans unterkommen well at one of the grandmothers for instance.
The Gogos as one mentions the old women in Zulu the pillars of the village are.
Some of them received up to 14 orphans with themselves, give them a roof above the head and guarantee for the children appearing in their uniforms every day on time for the school instruction.
Who does not have anybody anymore comes into the protection house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid just the same by the association as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore "Voices for Africa" started up a nearer school, built it two chicken houses and organized it together with the American health organization PSI, that many make in the village a HIV-Test have to do.
That is not a self-evident fact, because so obviously the illness in the whole country is also, one is silent they most gladly dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo, Annette Lennartz says, because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country in which the king holds himself to 14 wives officially.
The last absolute monarch Schwarzafrikas, king Mswati III, is known to his excessive life-style.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things it is owed also to this from a government viewpoint sanktionierten way of life that the HI-virus spread so quickly in the last decades.
But also the many migrant workers who take the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms indeed at every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "however those ones are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to support the cultural exchange something, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years together through the south of Africa and the a lot one still sings songs of full wistfulness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, at the southern corner of the black continent from times of the apartheid know.
A bus fuller white that sing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only atmosphere and joy, but wrested already from some grim border guards a few tears.
The journey always leads also after Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if one hardly finds the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Goes according to Esitjeni, there is the light" the people say there.
And when one returns the 8733 kilometers air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers into the test room at the Bergheimer street, then one sees it shining also there.
