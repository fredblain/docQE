A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a question of a new poker of president Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is keeping on being ever divided up more then with respect to the constitution declaration which gives him the unrestricted proxy in a temporary way, he decided on putting everything on a card.
For the surprise of all he announced on Wednesday that the constitution-giving meeting will adopt his final composure on the next day.
Just a week ago the head of state had lasted to this plenum two additional months for the end of his works.
Egypt counts now in almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly changed text, what weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal jumble.
This new initiative guaranteed only for an even stronger split of the country.
For his opponents the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" when it keeps on breaking his word and "infringes upon the right".
On pages of his proponents one assures that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possibly and to speed up the temporary process.
Within 14 days a referendum should be kept off.
A very short period which forces the brothers to renouncing their intention to explain the Egyptians the text section for Abschnitt.
For the president also a kind and manner is it to regain his public and democratic legitimacy during which protest rages in the whole country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time it seems to be convinced by that to Mohammed Mursi that the Egyptians will make benevolent.
Especially as an ultimatum is put to the Egyptian nation with this going back on a rash vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unrestricted proxy", latter according to assumption of the constitution supposed an end should take.
85 most mainly Islamic members of this constitution-giving meeting adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals did not follow the request.
In a word before the constitution declaration in the middle of November it has turned away since they think that they were not in the situation to make their viewpoints noticeable.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or the civil society acted equally.
11 persons, deputy members, were added to the reaching of the quorum yesterday morning in a rush.
Some suit the Muslim brothers very near.
It is not surprising that the articles mostly one-consistently were adopted.
The commentators found it after all the way entertaining, that the only difference of opinion of the day has come... in the time for the prayer to the expression, since some members of the committee thought that the pendulum clock of the constitution-giving meeting did not go exactly.
The text that yesterday evening still was adopted consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 that drew all attention onto itself, remains finally identical with that of the constitution of 1971 and it says that the basic principles of the sharia are the main sources of the right.
The salafistischen parties for which the establishment of the Islamic right is an important demand had the hope to replace "the basic principles" by "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamisten the fact that this article was not changed is a proof of their good will and of their respect towards the other members of the Egyptian society.
The liberals who regard this only as a propaganda stroke reply "hypocrisy".
Because according to them the Islamization of the constitution occurs via other articles.
In this case they have especially article which awards a discussing function to the university Al-Azhar in 220 in mind, in particular with respect to the inspection of the conformity with the laws of the sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier this is being, there "the persons that are called for a comment, were not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
One can "see" the first signs of a theocracy in that".
The apprehensions of the liberals are been nourishing in addition from the fact that the next rector of this university might be by far less moderate than the present one.
"Currently no concrete religious engagement is to be recognized.
With this constitution we stay within the framework of the middle class state.
Most lawyers that worked on this text, none are Ulema, but academics that were trained partially in the French system" Alexis Blouet appeases, who writes a thesis about the Egyptian constitution transition.
He adds, however, "that" "there can be an ambiguity with respect to the article in 220 since the used concepts are borrowed to the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisdiction, Anm. d. Talk.].
And in future the question to what extent civil judges are competent could be raised to decide on that."
Next to his religious aspect the yesterday adopted text is criticized strongly due to the comprehensive authorities which it gives to the president to the republic.
The Muslim brothers argue, that these compared with the former regime clearly are reduced.
A further quarrel point: the authorities of the army.
In accordance with the wish of the military the examination of the defense budget is not presented to the parliament, but a national defense council.
Just the same there will not be any prohibition of civil procedures in military courts as the unions to the defense of the human rights demanded it.
Latter inform also of their apprehensions with respect to the text, that they when freedom-threatening look.
The facts of the blasphemy are maintained, and insults are now forbidden, which could have fatal consequences for the right to free opinion comment, in particular for the press.
In addition no article anymore refers to the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion the only positive point is the prohibition of the torture through articles 36.
This word was not contained in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president yesterday evening on televison was having to be expressed, demonstrations for this afternoon planned are.
The proponents of the head of state will march up Saturday.
