The word "human rights" is missing in the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep split of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as a basis is hard controversial.
The Egyptian president did not economize on pathos.
We must create the crossing.
"And that it succeeds, suits in my responsibility, before the nation and before God", he said in the state television.
His speech was directed onto the whole nation, particularly, however, presumably onto the Christian Copts, the liberals, cleared up Muslims and Secular.
Because they alle, up to now hopelessly zerstritten in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God state at the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.
He has, so Mohammed Mursi, that competences of the constitution court in a temporary way circumcized and that broadens his competences, said almost apologetically "in order to save the revolution".
Nevertheless what the 61-year old engineer really wants to save that takes a doctorate of the American university from south californiums, the Egyptians are about that, the world does completely not realize.
Is the judicial power supposed to be entmachtet?
In fact the 234 articles that were rushed through by the 100-headed Constitution-Giving meeting in an Islamic way dominated there in a nocturnal, 15-hour ride at full speed are partial concern exciting.
As in former constitutions also it is said in the draft the jurisdiction is based on the "principle of Islamic right".
However, what are "principles" called?
That was and is interpretation thing and it stands to fear that the Islamisten will use the spongy formulation and the accompanying juridical elbow room for a more severe interpretation of the sharia.
At least an again led article suggests that: In all matters affecting the sharia the Al-Ashar-Universit채t must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great ray strength into the entire sunnitischen Islam.
That must not, however it can mean that the clergy supervise the legislation which would result the Entm체ndigung of the judicial power in the consequence de facto.
Many things in the Verfassunsgsentwurf are interpretation thing
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction is supposed to keep on keeping on being maintained.
These courts were used during Mubaraks domination for the suppression of oppositionist ones.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, it stands like this in the draft", "the true being of the Egyptian family" protect "and their morality and their values support".
That is juridically so blurredly formulated, that state institutions with the aid of this article could control even the contents of film art and literature.
In the plain text that does not mean anything else than censorship.
No article after all the way the equalization of men and women stipulates expressly.
For that another forbids to offend or to slander the prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
What, however, an insult is and remains as it is supposed to be avenged, unclear.
Just as dubiously the formulation seems, the "insult of people" is prohibited.
Does already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a jurisconsult reach there?
Interpretation thing, as so many things in the draft which there is for Mursi for the signature and which will be presented to "very soon" the Egyptians for the plebiscite according to his words.
"The revolution returned"
The opposition is forming for weeks against the predominance of the Islamisten.
Tens of thousands met in new harmony at the Friday evening on the Tahrir-place in Cairo and still vowed to bring the charter to case before it can come into force.
"The revolution returned and we will triumph", said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the premiership choices.
Friedensnobelpreistr채ger and ex-head-boss-chief of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei declared the constitution draft belongs "onto the garbage mountain of the history".
Via brief news item service Twitter he accused the supporters Mursis, to want to lead a "coup d'etat against the democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and fling it", said the Oppositionelle Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not atoned for yet", the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not to want to control the referendum through which it would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well organized Muslim brotherhood sounded the counter-demonstration for her part their part, as a precaution, however, not on the Tahrir place, but according to a mass prayer on the other Nile shore in front of the Kairoer university.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafisten participated in that and called: "The nation demands the application of God's law."
You demanded from Mursi: "The country cleans"! and declared: "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty about the symbol-pregnant Tahrir-place on which everything took his beginning would have caused presumably civil war similar states.
Mursis supporters did not want to risk that very obviously.
The Muslim brothers declared both the opponents of the constitution draft and the proponents would have been expressed clearly.
Now the time is to make the nation at the ballot box be decided into which direction the country is supposed to go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamisten is regarded as secure.
"The word human rights comes not even before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitution process, which actually would have up to February go and be supposed to integrate all social strengths.
The 48-year old human being lawyer and chairpersons of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers, than they were under Mubarak in the prison or in court court stood.
Not because he would split up their philosophy of life, but because for it human rights are indivisible.
For that he was beaten up, condemned, arrested.
"And now the word stands human rights not even in the new constitution", he laments in the conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi Machtausweitung onto all three powers in the state let the attorney give up.
These measures are striking violations of democratic game rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of fortifying the civil society, the president sets it de facto out of effect", laments Saeda.
However, without civilian clothes social organizations a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels solely calm, also of the international community that considers the ideological direction fight at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be avenged.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "It geb채hrt a monster that you cannot control more."
