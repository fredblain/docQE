My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are due to the missing chances forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to accusing the emigrants - hard times call it to them into the memory, he says
Navarrette thinks that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent journey to Mexico City I had just crossed first the hall and had arrived at the passport check when desperation spread in me.
Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").
I stood some seconds long there, unsure to which one I should go.
I grew up in central californiums and my whole life was mentioned long "Mexican".
An ethnic abbreviation - just the same, as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian" name themselves.
Later I decided for "Mexikanisch-Amerikanisch".
However that was here Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather there was not any need to abbreviations or hyphens.
I was simple only American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough, in order to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I do also not rid myself of my American accent.
Therefore I took my American passport and positioned myself into the snake for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment of this week, when the future Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto went to the White House, in order to meet president Obama.
On the agenda all those topics which one expects stood if the heads of these two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
It was interested to Pena Nieto also very much at that to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans staying nowadays in Mexico with just as high probability instead of emigrating to the United States.
He would like to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American commercial block according to model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels even if he did not name any details concerning that.
Mexico's relation to the United States is complicated and full resentment.
Most Americans never waste presumably an only thought of the United States collapsing into Mexico in the year 1848 and forcing the leadership of the country under rifle held up to leaving more to them than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
As soon as therefore a US Regierungsbeamter practices also only mildest criticism at Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints besetting the sovereignty of their neighbor country as the Americans about that.
And the children Montezumas go onto the warpath.
And nevertheless the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth suits to Mexican Americans who live in the United States in the relationship with the more than 35 million.
Inclination to talk about resentments?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winner and loser. People who the country offers chances for, and others which it does not do this for.
The only reason, why as many people of Mexican origin in cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, phoenix, Denver or San Antonio live, exists in at a point in our pedigree a person - maybe a parent or grandparents part - not getting any chance offered in Mexico and north migrating in the direction.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, and so forth.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faith is meant for them.
Not Mexico.
And although we live the American dream maybe now, have attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose from the eyes, that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity became blurred sometimes possibly, but what concerns our loyalty, is not this the case.
This means for the United States unequivocally.
In addition we are conscious that many members of the Mexican leadership shift do not like us to ourselves.
This is based on mutuality.
You see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish is never never good enough our bands to Mexico strong enough.
In your opinion our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not see ourselves now caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, however, nevertheless somehow lost.
My wife that was born in Guadalajara and immigrated to the United States as a child legally reminds me of between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions existing because Mexicans have a clearer idea above that who they are - and Mexican Americans are offended this at them.
While she is being a US American citizen, she sees herself as a part of two countries.
Nevertheless many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling on the one hand yet neither not to belong to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best thing of both worlds, nevertheless did not root in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something, which makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leadership persons and parts of the education bourgeoisie would like to resume their connections to the diaspora.
Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" who represent their interests in the United States want to use them for Mexico.
We are supposed to tell our American colleagues about that, as fabulously a visit of this country is and pressure on the political leadership exert, to intensify their links to Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And faced with the unfair income distribution, the unrestrained corruption and the drug power many of us are not so secure at all, whether it is really a question of a fabulous country.
I fear, there must their only through, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the contact with Mexico one and a half centuries ago yet, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for that as their member of the family only before not at all so long time were treated.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "more Mexican" than I thought.
