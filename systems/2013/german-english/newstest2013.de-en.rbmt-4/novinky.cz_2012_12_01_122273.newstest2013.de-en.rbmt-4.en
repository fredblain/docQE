"The people want that I save the republic, but I am only an amateur", says Okamura.
Mr senator, how does one come to the idea to run for the office of the president?
It is not a question of being senator or president for me.
If in our country all without problems functioned, I would not present myself anywhere.
But I do not keep up more notice how the republic is raided for 20 years as thieves run free while the taxes and the retirement age are being increased to the people.
I had not become any aspirations politician.
If I, however, see something which I do not like, I attempt then to suggest a solution in order to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and for this purpose independent and independent, I do not have any other possibility to influence the things than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
Into the senate you got it and then now onto the way into the castle done.
Do you not turn your voters the back through that?
I told myself the whole time, that I will incorporate the fight for the castle according to the result of the senate choices.
Later I specified this and said that I will run for the office of the president provided that I am elected as the senator.
My objective is not, however, the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need a lot of influence and a mandate as strong as possible for that if possible.
The difficulty does only not consist, however, in our chiding as a nation in the pub and before the television set, but massacring everyone who wants to change something.
The media who want to rob one of the honor, and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie come to that.
Over was asserted for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You incorporated the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and legal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive property declarations above 20 million crowns.
For this purpose you must change laws.
As a president you do not have any competences in this respect, and only the senate as a whole can be law proposals worth.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen I supported the guide remaining a free trade, and this could be put through.
The problem is the small-intellectual politics - when somebody of the right or comes from the left with a good proposal, this is refused on purpose, and that only stops the population.
As an independent independent I have a by far greater potential to gain support near all parties represented in the parliament.
My advantage consists in my being able to take without drawer thinking and party dogmas from every party what is the best thing for our country.
Do you see yourself as a human being in the politics rather to the right or to the left?
From Czech view it seems to me that the people see me rather to the left.
For me this right-link-thinking is, however, completely unimportant.
For me it is important that we get on.
It does not go to me around whether anyone belongs to the left one or to the right warehouse; I would like to bandage the people.
Always I support in public every good implementation approach even if this of the KSČM or of the ODS comes, and in the same way I will oppose bad ideas.
It displeases to you if somebody calls you populists.
But do you not confirm that through what you just said?
If you make a business plan in a company, you have also an ideal objective and a vision then.
And you would like to come closer to this.
One can refer to this as populism because of me, but all proposals which I spoke of already function in the world, or they were discussed by important experts.
But without support in the parliament you have only catchwords.
And in this way you do not come in the politics on a long-term basis far.
Or do you think that you will succeed in putting through the material and legal liability for example if you talk only long enough to the people?
I do not have any other possibility.
To convince politician, journalist and the public and to attempt, to bring page in order to put through these objectives they on our.
As a president it would not be a problem for me to call the chairpersons of the parliament parties for that live on televison to anchor the material and legal liability for politicians, officials, judges and public prosecutors by law.
And the addressed ones would have to say then where appropriate why they refuse this.
A strong personality who refers to grievances can exert pressure on the political scene.
Only take the direct choice of the president which was an income of the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am not either a genius or an intellectual.
I attempt to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just began with the politics first and attempt to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always attempt to judge the things themselves; and if it does not bang, I go back then in six years to the private sector again.
That rings a little bit as if Okamura should save Czechia.
I am not a rescuer.
I know that I do not achieve only anything; therefore I talked with several known personalities about whether they would not like to run also for the senate.
I spoke e.g. with Radim Jančura, who, however, refused because of overwork.
In addition I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who uncovered the fraud during the trade with light fuel oil.
I began my candidacy with the condition that the people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not more sure.
Sixty percent of the elective ones did not go at all for the choices, and those who went elected representatives of the establishment mostly.
In the senate we are in this way only two independents.
The people chose such senate composition, that changes will be only very much hardly durchsetzbar.
In spite of that I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct choice of the mayors and district head men.
Do you think about the foundation of an own party?
Over that because my not having any time I did not think about checking the past of every potential party member yet and has also not at all the money for that.
I do not have money for the president campaign once yet; only 20,000 CZK are on my transparent account.
You do not have any money?
You speak of property declarations, as yours would look?
I estimate my private assets at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, that is worth to about 10 million as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb to whom about a million is worth. And then I have still a few millions on the account.
The Aston Martin was after all the way a child dream - I always liked James Bond as it went in the car, was gallantly to women and fought against the evil simultaneously.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a property of 60 million and do not have any money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you would not like to invest your own money in that.
That is just not convincing.
I do not have any 15 million for the campaign.
Am I supposed to do for instance debts?
I put already 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors shows that my program does presumably not wake interest too much.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from own means.
The costs for the campaign are covered basically through my salary as a senator.
But I could not live from the senator content alone; so I could not finance e.g. my son the English school which tastes 30,000 monthly.
If I wanted to earn only money, I would run for quite nothing.
Do you remain active therefore further as entrepreneurs in order to have your living?
Did you not say that you will drive back these activities?
But that is not associated with the height of the salary.
How promisedly, did I drive back my activities in part.
Like this becomes e.g. my deputy in the spring manager of the travel agency.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.
But nevertheless I must live also on something.
Onto which month income were you accustomed as entrepreneurs?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also furthermore like this.
I would completely employ my enterprises as a president, however.
