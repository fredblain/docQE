With Bitcoin paying and selling without bank is possible
Transactions and service charges between the participants involved identified, the opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks.
In addition a political vision is as so often tangible in these technologies: the conviction, that the monetary system current, arranged from bank monopolies, to financial crises leads.
In fact the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (however in dollar, euro and so forth convertible) as also some protocols for the secure exchange as BitTorrent that facilitates the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network already about 200,000 transactions were understood.
Some a thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as a donation or as means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin had reached a highest level of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell onto 2 dollars before his recovering today on about ten dollars (the courses are performed on the web page bitcoincharts.com) five months later.
Nothing especially Impressive in comparison with the world trade of real currencies or finance products.
Nevertheless the European central bank (EZB) showed interest in that in a report published in October about virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in the competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes from other kinds of virtual currencies as that one "of Credits" that are used in order to get on in a video game that win one through playing or buy (and also exchange back sometimes) can.
The social network Facebook developed also such a system.
However, the trade is controlled each time by a central authority and dealt.
With Bitcoin all key switching centers nodes switching centers are simultaneously keepers of the account book, testers, money-emitters as well as buyers and sales assistants.
How does this network function?
Every transaction between two users occurs in reality between two e-mail-addresses in the form of an E-Mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for every payment what guarantees the anonymity.
A series of the data being related with this transaction is initialed electronic through a double encoding system.
The network can check the authenticity of the transaction for this manner.
With the aid of the contents of the file is to guarantee it also possibly that the sold Bitcoins are available in the account book of the public accounts spread in the entire network.
The decisive step consists in entering this new transaction into this book.
This happens about a mathematical task which is started on the computers at which the winner who is a kind of provisional central banker has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a question of a breaking up of the file, that is the transformation of a big file into a shorter and unequivocal electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it, before the whole "is chopped up".
It is the objective to find the number which makes a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number was found, the other knots can check easily whether it is the correct one.
The transaction is linked with the chain of all other transactions thus permanently, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user for the deceiving wants to pay two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other one stays without linking since both different fingerprints have.
The computer which solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
For the prevention of an inflation this reward is halved regularly, probable before end 2012.
The Bitcoins contained in the circulation are thus restricted, but divisible up to a a hundred millionth on 21 million, which lets a certain elbow room...
In addition the difficulty of the task with every improvement of the computer power power is increased.
The life of the network had already heights and depths.
The web pages that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin insertions.
"The used weak point does not affect the actual protocols", assures Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium that is an enterprise for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The EZB reports also about the possibilities of the money laundry with the aid of this anonymous service.
However cash points also this shortcomings on.
Important protagonists as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others as the blog-platform WordPress.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyzed from the Weizmann institute in Israel the account book and shown that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in the circulation.
In November a "Mega-Schlussverkauf" was started.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", Jon Holmquist, which works for the enterprise Coinabul that converts Bitcoins into gold, pleases itself.
Pierre Noizat, who is also an author of a book about this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or to a payment without contact with a mobile telephone, uses, however, Bitcoin for the validation of the transactions which are cheaper through that.
In addition the holder administers his identity and can remain thus anonymous.
The system can be implemented with the traders easily, and latter ones must install no new terminals or computer programs.
You must declare only an address simple, that of a telephone "photographed and recognized" can become, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users, serves.
A general trend in the case of which hierarchical systems are reconsidered for the benefit of more strongly horizontally achieved systems is to be noted.
"Some time will regret until Bitcoin continues, but in 2013 a turning point point could be", it predicts.
The EZB plans in their report after all the way, the different ones, risks today regarded as high in the case of a success of this currency revalue.
