"Protection of trade marks" in China: If puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What, however, is Armani Polo?
Behind that a denomination very officially entered into China which, however, does not have to do anything with the origin enterprises hides itself.
Nevertheless she enjoys for so long protection as the actual name donors do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are right.
"It becomes for foreigners increasingly more difficult to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, attorney in the office Taylor Wessing, who is specialized on industrial property rights injuries in Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
Already a few additional letters suffice the imitators so that they may announce their brands.
Lu-Gucci simply becomes like this from Gucci, instead of Prada one makes enter Prada-Kny.
Also German enterprises are copied in this way legally, about instance the sport article manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the brand office in Peking.
On 14th September 2010 a Chinese enterprise made there protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that operated itself also near the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in the copying and in the injured person of intellectual property is known.
In the big cities there are multistorey department stores which almost sell excluding forgeries.
Pattlochs cases, however, are different: On behalf of his mandators he proceeds against Chinese enterprises of the brand office receiving very officially the right to use a denomination which is already elsewhere protected.
The Chinese mention that "Bang Mingpai", a co-driver brand.
The word bases itself on "Bang Dakuan".
In this way women are meant, that catch rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not conscious of any fault to themselves
"That is business-damaging, one must "oppose" it", Pattloch demands.
"The brand that alone position disappears is watered down, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failure rates and the process costs of the affected branches go into the millions, particularly with the case of expensive showing-products.
According to information of the market analysis society CLSA the third-biggest market for luxury articles and that at the fastest wachsende is China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the brand register are to be achieved heavily and go into the money.
Up to nine years the procedure can drag on, with uncertain exit.
Pattloch reports about cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration the name complained about became the "market reality".
If the complainant has bad luck, he must pay the plagiarist even money because it hurt his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases affect also graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machine machinery manufacturer Sany, that enterprise that recently Putzmeister took over the German concrete pump farmer.
The Chinese may use therefore until today a mark which resembles the Mercedes-star.
The Volvo-buyer Geely used initially a blue-white logo, the one reminded of BMW; the quarrel was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who made the famous crocodile look into the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not conscious of any fault to themselves.
The brand office CTMO in Peking admits indeed that there were over there bottlenecks in 2010 because of too small personnel and room equipment.
In the last year one "returned", however, from the "emergency situation in the workflow process for the normality".
So the supply of raw objection procedures sank around 22 percent.
One finished almost 57,000 of such cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless 81,500 objections still wait in the office for execution.
Fighting against that costs a lot
How so often are in China the numbers impressing.
In the last year more than 1.4 million requests paid attention to protection of trade marks at the CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.
That is a record and means, that China for the tenth time behind each other the list of the new entries in all world would start, the authority informs.
That is valid also for the supply of all valid trademarks in total 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011 1.8 billion Yuan were taken at fees.
Simplifies is said that, that every registration on average costs 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against that costs a multiple as the case of the German family company joy mountain shows.
For more than seven years the company group is fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Indeed the Germans could achieve that his illegal manufacture of copied motor vehicle parts was dug.
Nevertheless the imitator kept on safeguarding himself the Chinese rights at the brand joy mountain.
One himself missed that since in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairperson of the management of joy mountain of Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand office CTMO also rejected the objection of the inhabitants of Munich then.
In the next two authorities Freudenberg was right indeed, however, the opposing party k√§mpft weiter until today.
One must look out infernally
Now the matter is pendant before the Uppermost Court of Justice.
It is confident to Wentzler to bring the thing to a good end and the professionalism of the courts praises.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely extensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerve."
The internal costs could hardly be numbered, the company archive had had to check files even a hundred years old in order to produce proofs.
Five years ago joy mountain of the opposite side offered in vain a "high six-digit" euro amount" for the settlement.
"At that one sees how much that is worth to us", says Wentzler.
The dangers in Far East tend to splash even to Europe back.
Then same, if unprotected brands are safeguarded to imitators there.
So a Chinese manufacturer wanted to announce the denomination joy mountain in Germany for shoes and leathers.
The company group gave up this business field for a long time, in spite of that it could avert the registration.
"One must look out infernally", says Wentzler.
Both it and the attorney Pattloch recommend German enterprises to be very cautious with the case of businesses with China.
Relying on international Markenrechte does not suffice, rather the foreigners should announce all which is somehow sensitive also in China as Wentzler says.
Otherwise that can become much more expensive than the registration can.
In fact: If Freudenberg is defeated in the last act of his brand drama, one would have to pay presumably the opposite side royalties then for the own name, declares Wentzler.
Or we are pushed in the segment in question from the market.
