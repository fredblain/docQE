Singapore needs babies to the rescue of the economy
The Singaporeans shift the fault onto the career, the stress and the costs of the immovables and the infant education for their not having any children.
"The population of Singapore must increase."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: Let's fulfill our civic duty and let's create lives!
It seems unplausible that the verses are part of an advertising for mint candies, but nevertheless - or just therefore - they became a viral video at the beginning of this year in Singapore on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, that local sayings as e.g. "shift" does "one "bao" (Loaf) into the stove" in order about the low birth rate in Singapore merry.
The advertising-company BBH that turned the video preserves the hope that the advertising spot reaches in merry way onto the problem attentively do.
Your creative conductor Douglas Hamilton say, that he wanted to use the power of the music to bringing the people to that, fulfill their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, therefore we had to design it merrily and wittily.
It is a question of the greatest problem in this country.
While propagating we are the worst of the world, therefore we noticed that it is a question of a topic which we had to see to.
We knew that the government had attempted many things as e.g. the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of Speed-Dating-evenings (fast flirts).
Possible, that many of these ideas were creative, they did not lead, however, to the success compellingly.
Therefore we thought: Why do we not make something as creative as possible in order to approach this problem how to compose e.g. a rap?
1.2 children
Who does not take this topic easy is the government of Singapore.
Every year she spends 1,300 United States dollars for political measures in order to incite the citizens to get more children.
Kind gives a parcel of the government for married couples and parents up to 15,000 dollars, prolongs the motherhood vacation and distributes tax advantages.
But everything had little success up to now.
Singapore is a rich, highly-technological city state in the southeast of Asia which is known also to the conservatism of his ruling and his strict social controls.
According to his national population authority the birth rate is at the present time near 1.2 children per woman.
Last time, when this rate was over 2 - what is known also as a replacement rate - was in the year 1976.
Therefore why get the Singaporeans not more children?
Tan Wei Ming, directress for marriage state and family politics of the national population authority, says that this is to be put down to a "better training" and "greater career chances".
"This made for the people possible, except for getting married and forming a family considerably more options with respect to life aims of having and priorities put", she declares.
These changes in the social factors contributed to the higher number at singles and at the putting off of the marriage and births whose result is the decrease of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile an immigration politics which is aimed at a drastic rise of the immigrations in order to counteract the decrease of the population led to resentments during the local population.
In Singapore there are web pages, where the hardly hidden xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for their holding the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The rise of the immigration is regarded also as one of the reasons for the government party achieving their worst election result in Singapore last year since the independence.
Since the choices an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and deliveries for foreign workers was made.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate is having the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the tax yields, the health costs and the immigration politics, the example Singapore shows also unexpected consequences.
The government attempts to achieve that as many small apartments are not built.
So she already has also effects on the housing market.
The authority for urban development that is confessed as "Shoe boxes" and the city may be built in certain fields began with controlling the number at small studio apartments.
These studio apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and show a great sales impact.
However, the worry exists, that they can support the life-style of the single, and that they deter the building firms from building big apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, president of the EL immovable company of Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold very much more quickly than bigger living-units.
You are so popular, and the units are faster around days and even weeks sold out as the bigger living-units.
This results in their being very much better for our Cash Flow.
He admits, however, that the new norms give the developers clearer orientations to which before obstacles were put into the way if they wanted to build too many small living-units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way for a rise of the national birth rate, it is to be understood from the conversations with the Singaporeans who work in the finance quarter that they will not have any great effect.
"The people are strongly stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, for which it is pushed out by many" a young manager says.
The children can get others.
"For me it is important, over" a man other, about twenty years old says "to decree my own money and time".
Men and women mention their career, the stress and the costs for the property and the education as reasons for their not being able to have any children.
Therefore the Singaporeans have to get the last word children if it is a question of that - there the government can do still so much.
