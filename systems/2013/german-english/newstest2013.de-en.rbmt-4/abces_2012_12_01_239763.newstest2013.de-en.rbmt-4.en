The most difficult profession of the world: the human sloggers of Kawah Ijen
For four euros the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and their health if they take 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stony ways.
There are people for whom their work is the hell, and others work in a word for word way in the hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn themselves their life who getting sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian Java island.
For this purpose it must climb down every day the ground of his crater, where the sulphur-containing gas flowing out of the earth hardens in the contact with the air.
After it has lacked big sulphur stones, be able to weigh the up to in total 70 kilos, it transports it over the sloping paths in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders of stone.
It is indeed only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that rises until a height from 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle speed, at which they keep the balance and their steps cautious have to put so that they do not slip and fall.
You know that every step can cost their life as this of a French tourist who fell before years at the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen passed.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulphur which they remove.
Above arrived, they would clear the way between the tourists, that they as circus monkeys photograph and walk with the baskets in a tiring way heavy three kilometers up to the scales that a mine society set up below on a height of 1850 meters a little bit further
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, that since 1960 the occurrences in the volcano uses and (never better said) his workers, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian Rupien (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulphur.
She sells that then for each 10,000 Rupien (83 euro cents) onto the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in the everyday life and for the production of matches, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar is used.
"Since we usually bear 70 kg, we receive for every way of about 46,000 Rupien (3.8 euros)", Anto that normally does three stretches on day declares us.
He needs three hours after which it is completely created for every stretch, at the end of the day he has, however, then 138,000 Rupien (11.5 euros) together.
What as a miserable wage for one such an almost inhuman effort looks is, however, the triple thing of what he would earn with the work in the fields.
"The day's pay of the mine workers here is where with the case of the coffee harvest of 15,000 Rupien (1.2 euros) on day pay and the average month income is two million Rupien (167 euros) very high", the carrier explains that before worked as a bricklayer on the touristischen Bali island.
There he earned 75,000 Rupien (6.2 euros) from the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduisten, and I brought it to Java in order to convert it for the Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases.
The 27 yearly Anto puts for three years his life at the Kawah Ijen onto the game, whose sulphur at the it already the first tracks has left behind, although it covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price which he must pay for the attaining of his dream.
"I will work here still two years because I would like to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in one more than only acceptable English's.
This young man agreeable and intelligent, but punished from the life could work than tourist leaders, waiter or at the reception of a hotel however instead of this he performs the work of a carrying-donkey.
He splits himself up a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, where his characteristic yellow color shines in the darkness bluish, because the sulphur flows out also at night.
The shadows provoking, it climbs in the light of a small helmet lamp at his helmet that he bought from his own money, into the crater.
About 400 carriers load themselves the baskets with sulphur onto their shoulders at the crater ground.
In spite of their great profits the mine society did not mechanize the sulphur disassembly in order to save costs and provides the carriers, that work onto own bill and be paid to weight, no outfit.
You do not keep also any part of the 30,000 Rupien (2.5 euros) for Zuschlag per camera which the guardians of this nature park demand together with the admission at the level of 15,000 Rupien (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to the photographing of the volcano and the human carrying-donkeys.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human being" Madrusin, a carrier stocky, 42 years old, of the three decades protests since abandonment of the school works at the Kawah Ijen.
It is in the situation, to support up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as it works" because he needs the money for the education of his three children in the age between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes itch, if the wind turns suddenly and clamps the mine workers in the thick columns that climb up from the crater, the men are so hard, that nobody complains about difficult illnesses... natural except for the usual breath problems, arthrosis, pains in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back Unainik with his 53 years is only in the situation to bear 50 kg.
Every day it and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, that of three LKWs about a goat path between the shrubbery to the warehouse in Tamansari in 18 kilometers distance are transported.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano my whole life was" Unainik declares at which it opens his mouth in which some teeth are missing far.
From his five children the oldest with his 30 years works also as a sulphur-carrier.
The time goes by, but the miserableness stops generation on generation in one of the hardest professions of the world: that of those ones who work as human load donkeys at the Kawah Ijen.
