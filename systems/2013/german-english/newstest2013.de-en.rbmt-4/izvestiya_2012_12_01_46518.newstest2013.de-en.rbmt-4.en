"The brain is made outwit up to now only moderately"
The topic of the broadened reality popular with supporters of modern technologies is perceived in last time for usual by the lens of some specific glasses.
First Google presented a functioning model in the summer during his annual conference, in November it became known then that also Microsoft had applied for a corresponding patent.
In the conversation with the conductor of the group for interactive three dimensional technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes, however, clear that the glasses were only a passage station for the scientists of the enterprise.
It provokes the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Describe please shortly which investigations your group practices.
- We occupy ourselves with the communication of Mensch and machine, want to enlarge in this case the borders of this communication, however.
Up to now the mankind got stuck most mainly in the phase in which with pixels on flat screens is worked that sometimes is also affected.
We, however, want to look 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this communication.
For example the Xbox-console and the Kinect-sensors are a progress, and nowadays no Xbox anymore without Kinect is sold since they all are interested in movement control.
- What expects us still in the future?
- Although Kinect brought the communication onto a physical level, many things still happen on the flat screen, sometimes in three dimensional.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the edition up to now not yet decisive.
We attempt to change that, work on real tridimensional representation systems on the basis of different technologies, under that projections.
We must discharge the computer world in our physical world and make it more definable.
For this purpose it, however, is necessary that not only the user, but also his surroundings is recognized.
Then we could much more simply complement the real world with virtual objects.
And most first of all we should become these goofy Virtual-Reality-helmets loosely!
- What do you think about voice activity detection?
It is popular, however she does not become overrated?
- It is surely not the space purpose solution since it raises questions to the privacy because one would not like to inform always all bystanders of his actions and intentions.
Actually every kind of communication with computers is good, however, everyone in their certain niche.
For example we worked in the field of the control of objects on public places at a project, at which we statt with short and brief, with projecting gestures experimented.
In this case the gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
Still it is relatively large, could be reduced theoretically, however, onto the size of a wristwatch.
However, in total the future belongs, however, to mixed control types, for example gestures and language.
- As that?
- We would ask me for giving you this soda water can you for example?
You say it and point simultaneously at that.
- Usually I only simply say it.
- Oh, that would be very heavy to recognize.
- That is called, you want the user to adapt to that what can perform a machine to the respective time and what not?
- Not absolutely, however it is a question here of a mutual approximation.
I think, that we work must in the next time of sensor types new particularly at the development, that make it possible to capture reactions of persons in a more exact way.
Those ones can be for example laser sensors since they offer a good solution in the depth, which is very important.
- Which claims do you put onto modern cameras departing from your work with the Xbox Kinect-sensors?
It mangles onto solution, depth or still something other?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of the tridimensional recognition.
8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be natural bad.
Not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth are nevertheless the main thing.
All current technologies are not so seen for us well enough, there the developers of the algorithms more work have.
It must not only the solution along the X- and the Y-, but be considered also along the Z-axis.
Also the speed and the number of the pictures per second are important.
The movements of the human being are extremely dynamic and the present 30 fps are openly said, in particular for gestures to little.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay in our lab in talking-moon between 1 to 100 milliseconds at which the present commercial sensors seem likely at the second value (60 to 100).
Not they all understand how that influences the communication of Mensch and machine very much.
I needed an appliance for my work just the same, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Would the number of the cameras not have to be increased?
- Kinect works at the present time with three "cameras", at what one of them is actually an infrared sender and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is in fact a usual RGB-camera.
It is not used for the calculation of the object depth.
More cameras could solve the problem possibly...
Or intensifying the problem since more calculations would be necessary.
A flexible, Kinect-similar system with the case of which we could play with different tiltings in order to find out how that helps us during the tridimensional determination of a position would be beautiful.
- If I remember right, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public unlike Google.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the broadened reality in the everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?
- It is not natural pleasant always to hold a smartphone on the way in the raised hand, however, I think following: The most fabulous variant would be a "changing" broadened reality with the case of which we could change over over a Cloud from the glasses on the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in that their strength (Only you can see private) lies, however simultaneously also their weakness, because a broadened reality by means of glasses prevents that you can work on virtual objects together with others.
- We long imagine a moment, that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark of irone One, but accessible also to standard measure mortals is.
There is a problem which critics of this idea refer to frequently: There is not any noticeable reaction!
The hands sense nothing at all!
Which answers does your group want to give onto this objection?
- In my lectures I speak often of the broadened reality representing the seventh breakthrough during the communication between Mensch and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could absolutely become the integration of the taktilen perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an a little unusual projection pad.
It perceives pressure excellently!
It, however, something solid gives the "pictures in the air" also technologies that in fact are achieved on that to lend, for example produced the interference of some done ultrasonic rays in a certain point, where the finger is, a feeling that currently, however, is still so weak as if somebody would blow over the balls of the thumb.
There are also bands for the wrist which influence the nerve extensions in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- You attempted, the brain outwit?
Think it make, that it senses what should sense it if it just sees something?
- That is a good idea, so we did not attempt it yet.
Here a further task which we will still long have to fight with, that is a human being that is in a locked room physically of making believe hides itself, it is instead of this in an open, practically infinite room; here we work on drafts with race bands (other than in fitness studios), movable platforms as well as big balls.
Up to now the brain makes itself be outwitted only moderately, and before us still many work-rich years lie.
Just that does the work on the field of the virtual reality for a researcher so rising: With the case of many topics we stand first at the beginning.
