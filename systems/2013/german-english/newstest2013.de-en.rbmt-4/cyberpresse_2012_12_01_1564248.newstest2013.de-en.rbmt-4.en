A republican strategy, in order to oppose the re-election of Obama
The managers of the republicans justify their politics with the necessity to oppose the choice fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds latter for a myth when confirms that the choice fraud is rarer in the USA than the number of the people killed from the flash of lightning.
The lawyers of the republicans recorded only 300 cases of choice fraud after all the way in 10 years in the USA.
One is secure: these new regulations will affect the poll negatively.
In this sense these measures untergraben in part the democratic system of the USA.
Unlike Canada the US Federal states are responsible for the realization of the choices in the single states.
In this sense the majority of the American governments since 2009 announced new laws which complicate the procedure for the registration or the urn walk.
This phenomenon gained importance after the choices of November 2010, at which 675 new republican representatives in 26 states could be recorded.
Due to that 180 drafts alone in the year 2011 were introduced which restrict the practice of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new choice laws require that the voters present a photograph identity card and a proof of the US citizenship.
In addition also the periods are reduced through these laws for the early voice delivery, declared the right to register on the choice day as voters for invalid, and arranged citizens for whom there is a court file the right to vote.
Before the choices of 2006 no US state demanded from the voters to show a photograph identity card.
Indiana was the first Federal state to raise such a demand.
The Uppermost court of justice of the United States confirmed the constitution moderateness of the law of Indiana in the year 2008.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice onto other states.
In the course of the last two years they supported in 34 Federal states drafts with which the voters are forced to show a photograph identity card.
It is to be said importantly that the US citizens do not have a universal ID card as the health insurance card unlike Quebec.
In fact 11% of the US citizens, that is 21 million elective persons do not have any photograph identity card exhibited by a government authority of their state.
In addition five million new voters do not have in the year 2012 such an identity card.
However, more than a hundred dollars are to be paid frequent in order to receive the necessary identity card.
From the new restrictions young people, minorities and people are disproportionately strongly affected with low income.
In fact 25% of the afro-Americans, 15% of the persons with an income of less than $35.000, 18% of the citizens do not have the necessary photograph identity card over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years.
This suffices still further.
It is not allowed in several states to the students that are regarded as voters that give their voice increased for democratic candidates to use their photograph identity card exhibited by their equipment.
On the other hand the same states allow members of fishing rod or hunt associations which choose more strongly for the republican page to use the cards made out by these associations for choices.
Before 2004 no Federal state demanded a proof of the citizenship for the dialing.
Arizona was the first Federal state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011 a dozen of states have passed laws which require of the voters that they prove their US citizenship.
These measures are aimed clearly at restricting the hispanischen voices.
Because it is obvious, that two of three hispanischen voters that prefer democratic party.
In addition republican legislators supported in 2011 in eight Federal states laws with which the registration was abolished by voters on choice day.
In addition you restricted the right to achieve those voters support from individuals and groups that would like to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example the campaigns helped for the voter registration with the case of the general elections in 2004 to register approx. 10 million citizens.
Because through those for 2009 adopted measures the part of the registration was reduced from new voters by 17% in 2010 in comparison with 2006.
In addition the republican legislators passed in five more Federal states laws which are aimed at reducing the period for the early voice delivery.
For example 33% of the voters who chose in advance, Afro-Amerikaner, were with the case of the general elections 2008 in Florida although they form only 13% of the voters of the Federal state.
Same one is valid for the hispanische population.
Latter formed only 11% of the voters, however 24% of the citizens that chose in advance.
In contrast formed the white, that represented 76% of the voters, only 46% of the voters, that chose in advance.
Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters opposed vigorously to the discharge of laws that restricts the registration of the voters.
Several drafts were blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors.
The general attorney of the USA intervened in order to misfire the most controversial laws.
You could restrict the damages in part.
For example only 16 of the 34 Federal states passed laws which require the showing of a photograph identity card.
However, the again introduced rules will complicate in the year 2012 the practice of the right to vote beyond doubt.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see the influencing of the results as a clear objective in them in the states decisive for 2012.
A report of the Brennan Centers by 2011 shows that the states that passed these laws form in 171 of the 270 voices that are necessary in the choice man committee in order to gain the premiership.
It is too early in order to confirm with certainty that these changes of the right rules will have considerable effects on the result of the premiership choices at the choice system in the year 2012.
However one is secure: these new regulations will affect the poll negatively.
In this sense these measures untergraben in part the democratic system of the USA.
