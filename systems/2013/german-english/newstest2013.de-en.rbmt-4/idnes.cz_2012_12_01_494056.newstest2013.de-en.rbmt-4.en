The cancellation of the law about non-profit works is not a solution.
In the last week the constitution court canceled the law about non-profit works.
This decision caused a lively discussion in public.
It is in a certain way interesting to consider the problems natures once from a wider perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalisierten world are based on the principle of the unadjusted economical competition.
In the final effect this means that the single national economies stand in a permanent conflict with each other.
The principle of the free trade and the free, unlimited movement of the private capital which goes with unbridled finance speculations hand in hand is cause for that.
Due to the great differences of the value of work (Wages) it results in price tensions.
A state is to be meant by this concept, attempted at that of the manufacturers to consist in the economical competition through import of favorable goods when he "surpasses" the competition in order to tear a greater share of the market coverage through that at himself and to increase his profit.
In the big standard this means for most enterprises to move their manufacturing abroad or to shop there favorably, or to give up, however, you business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparably high labor costs.
There the private capital no social responsibility and so that also no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it supports, the government expenditures expenditures expenditures increase necessarily.
This situation is still intensified by the gentlemen being completely unwilling to entrepreneur paying their taxes and replacing the entire-social economical and social damages caused by them by that.
This situation is generally known so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this place.
The inconsiderate practice of the private capital manages in the single national economies to kick a situation in which the governments see themselves forced into competition with each other in order to lower the social level of the own population artificially and to lure foreign capital in this way into the country.
In other words: The governments hand over the own population without regard for the social consequences to the private capital.
This is shown in particular in changes of valid laws.
It is an objective of these measures to force the own population to accepting the dictation of the private capital in particular in the pay bracket.
On the one hand this happens through economic compulsion with the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand through the curtailment of the employee rights.
Is the result wachsende poverty, as well as increasingly greater differences between arm and empire.
In Germany it is giving already for some years of public food delivery places for arms that are not more in the situation to eat through own work.
The number of the concerned persons goes already into the millions.
In the course of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy it results regularly in cases in which employees receive a so small wage that the state must increase their income up to the bare subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered also in the case of assistants personnel busy in the German Bundestag Federal Parliament.
The economy measures of practically all EU south states will come to the same state with the case of which the people are forced under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level undoubted to emigrate (how it was the case in the 19th century), or to suffer for a pittance on the fringe of the society and to hope in this case for sometime private investment capital flowing into the country.
Here the question, from where this capital comes, intrudes naturally?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty roams from a country into the other one; or the capital is completely missing now, because work in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco or Egypt and/or in Africa anyway the employees for one fraction of the European wages.
This completely affects Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim up to the satiety, that the state not participated in his own national economy with capital may, and that centrally managed economy leads to the economic disaster.
The private capital insists narrow-mindedly on his point of view, that the state may intervene not directing into the economy.
Then one must ask oneself, however, whether not the private capital the politics and in this way the entire state influences in the own egoistic sense or even controls.
Here the unequivocal answer is: Yes.
The proof of that is the existence of a lobby practically omnipotent and omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of the corruption, the mutual Bevorteilung, a legislation, in which practically all sträflich is, however nothing punishable.
In Germany the situation is like this, that a Ministry of State for lack of finances private, charged thickly with the industry intertwined right enterprises with the preparation of bills.
These bills are adopted afterwards in the Bundestag Federal Parliament.
All power does not take the nation as a basis anymore then as it the western constitutions announce but of strong finance groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies turn out currently quickly into a situation, wie sie Appian in his work for the crisis of the roman republic at times of Caesar and Pompeius 'describes: "The state was already for a long time understood in the decay, and the offices were filled with power.
Against bribe, through unlawful acquisitions by false pretences of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption was rampant without restraint, and the nation went with already bought voices for the choice"... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state did not "have" any consul due to this downfall for eight months"... "One began already really to talk about that, that the only medicine is an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man must be elected"... Appian thought in this case indeed of Pompeius, but finally the strong man was then Cäsar that replaced the democracy by the autocracy permanently.
As shows, the present society is based just the same as in the antiquity on the inconsiderate preference of the own advantage without paying attention to entire-social interests.
The private capital is not already from his nature to recognize the advantage for the entire society and to put it through here in the situation.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites which do in the least not make an effort for deeply issued reforms.
We must search the cause for the appearance of the fascism and the communism in the inconsiderate liberalization of the economic systems therefore in the 19th and 20th century.
Seen from the present state, the fall of these regimes can be regarded for the benefit of liberal democracies as a certain pause in the case of which the next round already emerges.
The fact is especially catastrophic, that the present elites that in losses of a hundred dew sending of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters whose witnesses we are already today, possible for future, as well as suit the crimes against the humanity as we know it from the older and newer history in complete ignorance opposite.
The cancellation of the law about non-profit works is not a solution here, at least none durable.
Under the pressure of the global and European economical competition it will be forced to Czechia to search ways also furthermore in order to press the social level according to the population below.
This trend is therefore system-dependent.
Purposeful political-social reforms that increase the capital participation of the state at the economy that increase influence of the citizens to the government and weaken the monopoly of the private capital in the society for the benefit of the state are the only solution.
