We withdrew from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the USA might follow at the end of 2014.
It is at the time that the Afghan army takes the possession of their territory again and that the Afghan population decides their future, to expect of us without any.
We punished in particular the Afghan farmers in our regarding her as terrorists.
And us even with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured person and disabled person.
The Taliban consist from foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, however, frequently also of farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at this time the Soviets.
You want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions even if Dschihadisten, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have followed them.
Latter ones will not be, supported by the local insurgents, tolerated, sometimes, anymore there if the western countries become more discrete.
The withdrawal of the French troops of the foothold in Nijrab which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees which was financed with the aid of French credits occurred properly.
The truck and tank convoys flown by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
From end 2014 there will not be any influx anymore of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance of 1994 to 1996 the conditions have changed themselves.
Then Kabul was empty and the country due to the fights of the different rebellious groups of the war cladded.
Your power takeover was regarded then as a kind of liberation and return to the security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation did not improve until today.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban held the common wish the women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came in 2001 onto the power again.
You changed into profiteers when they confiscated plots of the government around them as building land land onto refugees from Iran and Pakistan sell and so benefit from the massive American allocation of suborders pulled.
You brought yourself into disrepute, and most of them were not shared even at the fights.
As I heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, so as those ones, that the American allowances too Nutze could do: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people have the war and his ideologies fully.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan they had contact to the modern world, and their advantages enjoyed.
About 65% of the population is less than 25 years; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls as boys.
One will have to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return either for the obscurantism of the former parties or for the corruption of certain managers.
All, also the armed parties, are had by mobile telephones; the television with his Turkish series which represent a modern world is looked at everywhere.
An army is now available.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will stand regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight already make an effort for the restoration of the militias in the province that will escape from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have profited by a certain decentralization at the example of the western nations, but through abolition of the office of the Prime Minister that existed since the constitution of 1964 the USA wanted to make from it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karza√Ø does not want any foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the choices planned for April 2014.
However, his country is since the fifties and already long dependent on foreign help before.
Industries were not reconstructed, operative jam works are not available and important irrigation system's were repaired not.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetable nothing is produced.
The private initiative the priority is let.
In a country which was directed from 30 years of war as a basis a state control of the infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan would have immense mineral resources was spread.
This reinforces still the impression that the western countries were only on site in order to take hold of that.
Without energy, in order to work the iron or copper ore on site, and/or. without means of transportation for an export about the mountains no mining industry is possible.
The Chinese already almost left the copper mine from Mes Aynak, make the international archeologists make (financed by the World Bank) their excavations on the gigantic Buddhist place and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will be also necessary, that Afghanistan and Pakistan, of which extensive the One- and are exports dependent, restore normal relationships.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was finished on 20th November.
The new cooperation contract plans the continuation of traditional aids: Girl and boy grammar schools, institute for French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical one and agricultural field, support of the archeological delegation.
Since 2009 a service of "civilian clothes military actions" of the ministry for defense (Cimic) that was stopped in 2012 in dozens has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the renovation of the agriculture from mountain villages and carry on from a small French nongovernment organization make in order to attempt that "To gain hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of the compatibility of aids and offensive actions.
These works for which numerous local workers were necessary had been able to help to suppress the revolt: Irrigation, well, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, ground protection and rise of the agricultural useful areas.
Which souvenir do we leave behind after military editions of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of the local living conditions that is very hard in these valleys often lying in a height of more than 2000 meters.
In the message dozens of written inquiries of small agricultural intentions came in from municipalities of the province Kapisa.
So that the farmers free from the revolt led by foreign groups, which is their wish according to their own statements, the continuation would be smaller, well more controlled and they civilian aids'' affecting directly for their advantages necessary.
