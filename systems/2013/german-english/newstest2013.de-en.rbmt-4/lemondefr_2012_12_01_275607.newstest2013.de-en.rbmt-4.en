Immovable scandals of great extent in Quebec
Officials of the road authority, enterprises of the construction head trade, Geldbeschaffer of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a splendid "system" in which building industry trade, officials, politician, trade unionist and mafioso are knitted.
An "industry" which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebecs, in particular in the 1990th and 2000th years.
"It is strange as the system falls apart since one took drastic measures" Jacques Duchesneau, representative in Quebec and former conductor of the police of Montreal, jokes.
The scandal was uncovered by it due to an investigation of the embezzlements in connection with the contracts to road construction works in Quebec coming in which the former prime minister had agreed to only unwillingly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in the year 2010", emphatically it, "the traffic ministry" would have "saved" a billion dollars "alone "at the contracts", because some zügelten in this case their instinct in order to receive their part!
The Charbonneau-commission brought already two mayors to case, he adds to show the tactics in the hope that she succeeds in it behind the individuals.
One 2011 started up, permanent anticorruption unit
The 2011 started up, permanent anticorruption unit undertakes also great efforts with their troops at auditors, investigating and analysts of the government.
In addition the policemen of the "Marteau troop" that has caused since 2009 that the "canalization cartel" goes ahead from Montreal during the artificial inflation of the contracts more cautiously...
In the last weeks she carried out serial house searches and raised accusations against local mandate carriers as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is a mayor of a suburb, because of fraud and corruption.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, which resigned just from his office as mayors from Laval, the third-biggest city of Quebecs.
He is suspected, repeats in the exchange for public tasks bribes have received.
Expressly engineers of the road authority were accused after all the way by Montreal, as well as entrepreneur of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Latter one aroused sensation when it explained the mode of operation of the "system" to the commission for the receipt of public tasks.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts preserved in Montreal to a mediator being connected to the Mafia that transferred the money to the Montreal union several years long the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito had in the 2000th years his hand everywhere in the game, when it more than 88,000 Canadian dollar (approx. 68,000 euros) at province parties gave, particularly onto the liberals then been at the power.
He also confessed, to have organized an illegal mid procurement for the former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalization contracts whose costs were blown up by it artificially
In Montreal the "system" of the corruption functioned smoothly.
The former civil engineer engineer Gilles Surprenant described this fully detail before the commission: in ten years he received from the building contractor presents, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes at the level of 736,000 dollars as a return service for canalization contracts whose costs it blew up artificially.
Other officials of the road authority admitted that they could be lubricated in their blowing up the bills with wrong addition services artificially around 30-40%.
In addition an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he overlooked on purpose a shadow budget that filled his cash boxes with black money.
Due to these disclosures Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which flung Montreal into a hard crisis.
Chantal blind was one of the first representative of Montreal to beat alarm.
As a mayoress of the municipal district district district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she revolted from 2010 against the sale of a municipality plot, that for 5 million dollars was acquired and for 1.6 million builders in the boomenden property market were resold.
70% of black money in the choice campaigns
From the investigation that finally is carried out she says, that they "at a thread that it makes possible to understand the mode of operation of the system unterwanderten by ants in order to stop the evil and to denounce the guilty parties pulls".
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are at cleaning the wound, would need, however, an investigation unit specific only for Montreal, as well as a supervision, in order to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How one cleans.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau says for his part its part, about Officials stealing several hundreds of millions of dollars is, particularly concerned, however, about the role the "Mandate carriers that are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not complex into the fraud!
Departing from a part of 70% of black money during the financing of the choice campaigns in Quebec he jokes: "It was said to me that this is only a weak poor copy of the reality."
The government Quebecs suggests to restrict the donations to parties to 100 dollars which would not change anything at the situation according to it: "As long as the election campaign editions are not restricted severely, black money will be in the politics in the circulation."
He recommends a complete reworking of the system for the allocation of public tasks and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall more deeply; when we go the things with courage onto the reason, we can reconstruct the house on a sounder basis with more controls and laws."
If this history damages the international renown of Quebecs and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau asks those ones who laugh at that to fling a look into their own back yard...
