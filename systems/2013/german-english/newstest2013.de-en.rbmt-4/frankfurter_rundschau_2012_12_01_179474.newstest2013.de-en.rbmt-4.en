Messenger: Eis discovers NASA on the Mercury
The probe Messenger found proofs of there being ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice is supposed to be possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The NASA US aerospace administration proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the sun next, there is also there frozen water, as follows from three studies published on Thursday in the compartment magazine "Science".
The probe Messenger found proofs of there being an ice in the region of the planet lying permanently in the shadow.
This is supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water came presumably from comets or possibly also asteroids which struck on the Mercury.
Nobody relates the find with the existence of lives from ice, however, on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger-Sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
The finds could help, however, with clearing how water and other elements stones of the life reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed from the mortals probes, telescopes and small robots as phoenix are there, to explore the depths of the cosmos.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: Small spyholes into infinite widths.
The picture comes of a camera which German researchers of the Max-Planck-institute developed.
The eight planets of our solar system, in addition the dwarf planet Ceres.
As Pluto, who circles behind Neptune around the sun, Ceres is to astronomical according to the new definition of terms of the Internationalen union of 2006 no "planet".
This detail of an infrared-photo of the sharpener-telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: The oldest stars are to be recognized as blue points, those ones are heavier to identify to pinkfarbenen "newborns" in the star circle hall.
This star-educational region - mentioned W5 by scientists unromantically - discovered the telescope sharpeners in the star picture Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light-years.
The sharpener-telescope of Nasa included this fluorescent glow of a dying star.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material which the star flung in the dying-process.
In the gigantic Trifid-fog, 5400 light-years of the earth away, new stars arise from gas and dust.
The sharpener-telescope of Nasa fired these photo of the galactic birth stubs.
The Pleiades star cluster, mentioned also the seven sisters, can be seen at night with the unaided eye.
With the telescope the colors become noticeable better, however.
How a red Age looks the helix fog on this infrared photo towards the observer.
It is 700 light-years away in the Aquarius-constellation.
His similarity with an earthly continent brought the title North America to this fog one.
A combination of normal and infrared photo guarantees for the spectacular color.
This baby star could be incorporated in his full beauty first through the infrared detectors of the sharpener-telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How these arose is one of the great puzzles of the astronomy.
Possibly they are the remains of a Saturn-moon which disappeared before 4.5 billion years without a trace.
One of the greatest and sharpest photos of the Hubble-telescope: The whirlpool separator galaxy
According to color photos of spiral galaxies become true work of art.
The photo published from the European South Observatory shows the Trifid-fog several thousands of light-years remote in the constellation floodgates.
The name Trifid comes from the roman word trifidus (dreigeteilt, three-fissured), there the glowing heart of the star Geburtsst√§tte darkens dust patrols dreiteilen.
In the constellation snake carrier astronomers photographed the heralds of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years of the earth away the cores of two galaxies melting together on each other race too and will collide inevitable with each other.
This star-birth recorded the Hubble-telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom technical abbreviations do not suit, that one likes to mention it Southern Fire Wheel with the case of their nickname.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a section from the iris fog in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years remote fog consists of dust granules which are smaller ten to a hundred times than usual house dust.
This picture was joined together from optical and X-ray photos of different telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes, 430 million light-years of the earth away.
The space telescope Hubble included this group of galaxies, mentioned Arp 273, for Nasa.
Scientists UGC 1810 name the bigger spiral galaxy.
The brightest group of young stars of our galaxy is in this star fog.
The star cradle produces always new Youngster.
Also this star-cloud, connected with the rosette-fog, brings constantly new baby stars - 5000 light-years of the earth away out.
In this galaxy shining brightly with a small black Loch still no dust, but only gas exists.
Presuming more brashly that it arose only shortly according to the Urknall than in the universe hydrogen was mainly to be found.
Our insights into the space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is supposed to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - still before Galileo Galilei used it a year later for the star observation.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became increasingly bigger - and the insights that supply it, increasingly deeper.
30 years long, indeed of 1947 to 1975, the Hale-Teleskop was San Diego near in the Palomar observatory the biggest telescope of the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It approves looks into the space to more than two mirrors now, everyone with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the grain of Telescopio Canarias on the Kanareninsel La Palma is gigantic - only the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in the diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
In spite of that it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is lashed up in his altitude angle height - and restricted in his mobility in this way.
Also the hobby-Eberly-telescope in Texas is fixed in the altitude angle height.
His special feature: the high light collecting-strength.
This reaches indeed - in spite of comparably small mirror diameter - onto which the worldwide biggest reflecting telescopes'.
With the aid of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to the space to extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Every computer owner can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) when he provides computer power power.
Look at the observatory of the European observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope stands - that his name all honor does.
With his in total four mirrors the telescope can illuminate also the middle infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO-observatory the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
His main mirror mirror is supposed to grasp full 42 meters - and be put from just 1000 mirror elements together.
With pictures people are to calculate, however, in at the earliest 2018.
To 2007 the two saucy-telescopes were regarded as the largest of the world on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea.
You offer now two mirrors with an average each of ten meters.
The saucy-telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-observatory which still looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru-telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, gigantic telescope is supposed to arise - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be marveled at on an illustration.
The space telescope Hubble supplies the most important impressions from the space, however.
Since the 24th April 1990 it supplies already pictures from far worlds.
Since March 2009 the space telescope searches Kepler to extrasolar planets - above all after such that are habitable.
On 2nd February 2011 it was announced by the Nasa that 1235 planetary candidates were traced since mission beginning.
In the picture the last start preparations are documented to Kepler at the space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is fired into the space in at the earliest 2018 on board a Ariane5-missile.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is supposed to search to light of the first stars and galaxies according to the Urknall.
Scientists assume that also at the South Pole of the Mercury ice exists.
However, there are not for that any dependable data since the Messenger circles far nearer at the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been indicating for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.
Through the Messenger-Sonde started in 2004 - the first to circle around the Mercury - the scientists have certainty now.
