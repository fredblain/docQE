Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto stands before difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing himself for his assumption of office, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges awaiting him and the mixed feelings of his nation.
The traffic is completely current especially in Mexico City bad.
Even on better days this is an always blocked city, however, on Monday a ring of steel which shuts off several important traffic routes into the capital and guarantees for chaos on the streets was established.
It was not the objective, however, to disturb commuters on the way to the work but to hinder demonstrators at reaching the parliament.
On Saturday Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the president bandage and take the leadership of the nation.
It stands before a complex task.
Under the parting government Felipe Calderons Mexico had been able to persist economically well, however, the country is in the grip of a drug war which cost already 60,000 human lives in the last six years.
"My government commits itself strongly to reducing the power", declared Pena Nieto the US American president Barack Obama at the beginning of this week in the oval Office.
I will suggest a new security strategy with which we can reach this objective.
Before it went onto eye level with the US president, Pena Nieto was active as a governor of his home state Mexico.
In this thickly settled, detailed part of the country which surrounds the capital the opinions are divided about the new head of state.
A direct man
In the faraway small town Valle del Bravo one remembers it for example gladly.
Inhabitants of the vacation place ascribe the development of the tourism and the construction of the infrastructure to him.
In order to reach the city, one can go on one of the motorways that made build Pena Nieto and represents the one great improvement opposite the fragile, bumpy streets that there was here once.
Hanging plaques with his name also outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for the climate change.
"We expect real and continuous changes of it", so his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, that as a congress representative for the party of Pena Nietos, who PRI works.
In particular, what concerns the security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years at the power the PRI was dissolved in the year 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The congress representative Olvera admits that the party puts great expectations from Los Pinos after 12 years outside of the president palace at Enrique Pena Nieto.
He refuses the reproaches of the opposition the new president lacks substance.
He is a very direct man, very much engages and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, particularly he is, however, also somebody who can listen.
But on the other page of the state many people do not divide this opinion about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also confessed as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and represents a suburb of Mexico City itself in many kinds of respect.
And the problems in the municipality are from decisively urbaner nature.
At the beginning of this year the military was called in in order to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and an especially acute problem is violence against women.
On a spot fallow near a big dump the corpses of dutzender murdered women were let only in the last two years back.
During the term of office of governor Pena Nieto more than 1,000 women were murdered in the Mexico state - a statistics that surpasses even the one of the city of Ciudad Juarez that is notorious for their power and the murders of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos think that he did not approach the problem of the woman murders adequately during his term of office at least.
However, in the worst case his government shut their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete construction, typical for the quarter come down, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when it shows me photos of their late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events Mariana committed in 2010 suicide.
Nevertheless their family believes that she was murdered by their companion in life.
"When I arrived at her at home, it seemed" remembered to Senora Buendia "as if their body was washed".
It gave to signs that it was beaten, and the rigor mortis had already started.
While their mother is telling their history, a picture looks up from the wall from Mariana down us. It is made next to a cross which carries an only word: Justice.
Nevertheless exactly one refused her these, according to the family, until now.
The authorities treated me as if I a chatterbox, troublemaker, were a complainer.
You would like, that one simply accepts their judgment and keeps quiet.
"But that is not possible if there were so many irregularities and lapses", she says.
If president Pena Nieto obtains the president bandage on Saturday, it takes over also a great responsibility in this way.
Tens of thousands Mexican families were damaged in the last six years of power crimes, and the new president promised to see especially to this problem during his term of office.
I hope, as a president it is like this as he was as a governor" the PRI congress representative Olvera in Valle del Bravo says.
However exactly before that fear the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza the most.
