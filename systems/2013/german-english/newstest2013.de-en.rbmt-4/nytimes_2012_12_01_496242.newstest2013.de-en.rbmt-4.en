In a constantly electrified world it is beautiful to be also once bored
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours in the airport, than our airplane due to mechanical problems turned out and we had to wait for another airman.
I had therefore enough time in order to do me a few thoughts to boredom.
I do not want to lie.
To wait for a flight half a day at the airport is quite nerve-killing - self, if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
However always more academics and child development experts mention boredom than something positive.
If it works after them, it is okay for us - and our child - to be sometimes bored.
In this way the brain is forced to be lost in interesting trains of thought which supports the creativity possibly.
And because most of us nowadays almost constant onto that one one or stare other screen, the advantages of the boredom do not benefit us anymore.
Should we welcome the boredom therefore with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I come to that once again back.
As many people also I assumed always boredom being a relatively current phenomenon which developed with advancing leisure time.
However, Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and roman history at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that like this.
"In fact the boredom has a very long history", he says.
A roman graffiti above boredom which goes back to the first century adorns the house walls Pompejis.
And then still the question is there how we define boredom actually.
John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of the psychology at the university York in Ontario, according to Canada the problem consists in boredom defining in all sorts of ways and being discussed.
After long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 persons professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion came, that boredom as the experience, "to want to carry out a satisfactory activity, this, however, not can" can define.
Boredom is distinguished from apathy accordingly in such a way that the person is not busy, would like to be this, however.
With the case of the apathy on the other hand it gives no urge, to do something.
He says, the key experience of the boredom, consists in a "trouble of the attention process, combined with bad mood and the feeling that the time goes by only slowly."
Boredom can almost sound in this way so as depression can.
But professor Eastwood believes, although these two states could be related, bored persons see the problem in their surroundings or the world while depressive persons are seeing the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that concentrating is boring to us even if we only have difficulties.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in term of Attention "- to German about instance: "The inactive intelligence: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention", which appeared in September in the technical journal paper "Perspectives on Psychological Science", professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to a former experiment there, with the participant a volume listened, on which a person read out a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud channel program from the adjacent room which doing did not have anything with the contents. Others heard it on low volume so that it was hardly perceptible while the third group was not vernahm these noises at all.
The persons that did not vernahmen the hardly audible television declared to versp√ºren more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could not find any reason for these and ascribed their difficulties to the boredom.
If one attempts to concentrate on a difficult or hard task, the trouble of the attention can lead to boredom, says J. Fenske, associated professor for neurosciences at the university Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study, to marks.
When one on the other hand a monotonous activity carried out - "so as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can turn away and help with not "feeling" bored".
Actual, so he says, we know now, that these can even oppose Herumzappeln and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign for boredom, when persons remain physically more attentive.
"Studies showed, that learn children that may jump about more and keep more information than those ones that are forced to the Stillsitzen" so professor Fenske.
To us all becomes sometime once boring - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, an especially tiring film.
But some persons are bored more easily than others are.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980th years a "scale into the boredom delicateness".
On the scale statements as "Many things that I must do" are found "repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything".
With the aid of such scales researchers found out that to boys becomes more often boring than girls so Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the west Florida university - in particular, what affects the need according to more and a greater variety of external charms.
However, in general teenagers are a quite measured heap.
Reed Larson carried on in the year 1991, professor for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment, at which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times on the day with a beeper.
He found the way out, that 32% the watching-sending in the school and while finishing the homework were bored, wohingegen 23% indicated, bored to be if they were not in the school.
However only 3% of the parents declared to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages increased with regard to the boredom or sank.
He is, however, secure that the youth is felt as especially boring, main, because children and teenagers do not have any great influence on their everyday life course.
Back therefore for my origin question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because at the very most it leads to that that people take extreme physical risks onto themselves and succumb to the gambling or to drugs in order to ease it - studies showed that.
On the other hand many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion professor Vodanovich that is investigating the topic for more than two decades is.
"With the boredom it wants to tell one the brain that one should do something else", according to Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the New York university.
But the brain does not know always, what one should just do best.
When one boring is and used one this energy in order to play Gitarre and to cook, one becomes happy.
However, television can guarantee at short notice indeed for happiness, these evaporate on a long-term basis but again.
It can talk out who gives an iPad to his bored child therefore indeed of the boredom in this way. It has in this way yet not learned to maintain or to control oneself, professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "Self-control spreads from a situation to the other one".
The child does only not learn to talk, but he receives more self-control also in other fields.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Also we should not see it too critical.
Instead of this our objective should consist in feeling well also off the constant activity and technology irrigation.
Professor Eastwood agrees to that.
"It rings as if have to be to us more often boring. But boredom is the tormenting, incessant wish, to do something reasonable", it says.
He believes that the people in truth seek only to a way to switch off and to relax.
"In some surroundings in which we are stimulated constantly it is difficult to occupy oneself if the noise has stopped once."
