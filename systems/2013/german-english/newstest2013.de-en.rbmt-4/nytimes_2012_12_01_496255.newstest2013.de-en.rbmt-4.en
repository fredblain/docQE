In Colorado there is not any clear guideline for the new marihuana law
The 19-year old Community College-Student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorados for an offense that will already soon be legal in this state in court court: The possession of of a few marihuana pieces and a whistle with which it smoked these.
According to Orozco it and some friends were on a September day by car, when they were stopped, in Lamar near the border to Kansas on the way.
After the police officer had found marihuana in the car, Orozco was summonsed for the possession from drugs and drug utensils - peccadillos which are equipped with a punishment of 100 United States dollars in each case - and received a court hearing.
"We" are "treated" as criminals", according to Orozco.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts marihuana for the own use to legalize, the answer shakes off less of the law at hundreds of smaller drug offenses, than from the location.
Hundreds of infractions of the law that turn around marihuana become Washington here and in the state, who approved similar measures, already trap-calm.
The police do not follow adults because of possession longer over 21 years in small measure. This is allowed by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next weeks.
But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados announced, to weiterverfolgen existing marihuana offenses and people summon still in court court.
At the same time several cities vote, from the suburbs of Denver above to the western Mountains above that, to hinder licensed new, state marihuana businesses at the opening in their municipalities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I do not know at all what will happen as next", Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, says that lies east of Denver.
And also regulation authorities in the Washington Federal state scratch themselves helplessly at the head.
You wait for a guideline to the equipment of a license system for the production, production, the marketing and the sale of the drug - and have in this case a period of time up to the 1st December 2013 in front of eyes.
In Washington one thinks that Colorado is ahead of most states in every case what affects the regulation of marihuana. There the drug first to medical purposes and then for the own consumption was legalized.
"Colorado has a more strongly adjusted market. The state is suitable for the orientation well therefore", says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the inspectorate, for spirits in the Washington state.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to be used in the sense of a coarse guide.
"We do not have any real precedent which we can follow" he adds.
The Washington law, mentionedly I-502, comes into force on 6th December and forms in this way also the endpoint of a grey zone in which indeed yet the state license system does not exist, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practice questions must be clarified in this time - about instance, as the state handicap of an "adequate access" to licensed marihuana with the prohibition of cannabis businesses within a radius of 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities is supposed to be agreed.
"Nowhere it will not be heavier, to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in town areas, in particular in the conurbation of Seattle", Ben Livingston, speaker for the "center for Legal of Cannabis", means a recently formed team of researchers.
On 21st November Chief Oates sent his employees an E-Mail in which it declared the public prosecutor would not pursue smaller marihuana offenses longer with persons above 21 years into Aurora and that the police "immediately now on" will not strive for any charges for these offenses.
Chief Oates added that the police will keep on putting through urban handicaps for the regulation of peasants of medical marihuana and drug traders would keep on being followed.
In Weld County in the north Colorados district public prosecutor Ken Buck represents a more severe opinion.
After the vote it indicated his authority would keep on pursuing cases of marihuana possession main, in order to move consumers for the revocation.
Currently 119 persons must justify themselves for the possession of about 50 grams or less marihuana court court although many were accused also for other offenses.
"Our authority pursued the duty violations with the case of which it was" a question "of crimes" to the action time" Buck could be announced in a declaration.
The reactions are conflicting even at places as the rural mesa county, where voters refused the marihuana-initiative.
The police in gravel Junction, the biggest city of the rural district, do not announce adults longer for the possession of smaller amounts.
This decision supported district public prosecutor Pete Hautzinger, decided, however, also on that, not fall all outstanding possession procedures to let.
"I do not believe that I waste my time with putting through the right until it is changed", he says.
Although 55% of the voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was already from the beginning clear that it would not be simple to agree the personal consumption of marihuana with the complexities of government and judicial system.
And the inconsistent reactions in the whole state supported a far-reaching conflict among local officials with regard to the great green experiment to light.
With district public prosecutors it is a question of a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver that represents for marihuana offenses defendants standing in court court and acts on site as a speaker for the national organization for the reform of marihuana laws.
"You transferred a so big part of their life with following persons legally because of their not still being able to accept the legalization", he believes.
As first states, Mix the smaller one marihuana as to handle alcohol, Colorado and Washington as national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs are sold.
While intercessors and civil servants are preparing themselves for an age of legal sale, they wait simultaneously also nervously for instructions of the Federal Government which keeps on wanting to treat the sale and the building of marihuana on federal level as a crime.
Intercessors of the legalization movement hope for the Ministry of Justice giving in.
In spite of several sensational arrests of consumers and sales assistants of medical marihuana the Federal Government allowed the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the majority.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug politics consultant of the Obama government thinks that detectives will probably indeed not kick in any doors, will presumably bristle, in order to confiscate smaller amounts of the drugs, however, to allow the marihuana businesses legal under the new legislation, from a government viewpoint adjusted.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait first at all for the federal authorities acting.
Still before the choice day some local local administrations approved moratoriums for new marihuana-businesses although these could not open before in about instance a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six month long prohibition which is presumably adopted next week.
"We would not like to get into a position with the case of which we license somebody and "stand then on federal level" before a great problem", according to Bob Nicholson, member of the town council councillor.
Our municipality voted against this law change.
We straighten, for which the municipality decided and not after what the state decided for.
Nor many questions are not open.
