NKÚ-leader: Control of the black-system fails on account of the politics
Czechia has good surveillance entities and appropriate laws in connection with public tasks, lapses, however, into their application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz the vice-president of the Highest control office (Nejvyssí kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, says this.
"A law is never complete, but it must be used correct - and this is my opinion's with us not the case, Kala comments on the current situation".
Apparently for a similar result also a common control comes through Czech and German testers.
As a negative practice example he mentions the attitude of prime minister Petr Nečas towards the so-called "black-system".
Recently the prime minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - the system is therefore now forbidden or allowed?
"A law must have nevertheless his validity, and if something is by law prohibited, nevertheless the government chairperson can simply not come then, and hinder the control office whose duty now is the control of the compliance of the law in his activity", states Kala.
On the meeting of the control committee of the chamber of deputies you talked about a common Czech-German project in whose frames the laws of both countries were compared with each other concerning public tasks.
What was it a question of there actually?
It is a question in this case of a parallel examination which we about two years ago began with.
Simplifies saidly, it is a question of the European legislative determining how public tasks are to be handled. The single state legislations base themselves on that. And finally there is still the actual practical application.
We compared this all with each other, and although the examination is not yet finished, we could find extremely interesting differences. Maybe even still, generally saidly, the laws are "more severe and more perfect" a little with us, the actual application, however, is better in Germany in some parameters.
It is confirmed with its not sufficing to make again and again new and more exact rules. One must deal also with the actual application of the right.
To what extent can the project be a help to you? What results for you from this project?
Just such common control could contribute to our stopping calling us in for a Perfektionierung of the laws and the lowering and Austarierung of threshold values constantly if this does not affect obviously especially positively.
Economic efficiency management means to gain a thing for a reasonable price (what always the lowest price is not) and to exclude illegal enrichment or really criminal actions.
But the lowering of threshold values for tasks does not guarantee that we also reach this objective.
Maybe it is even like this that we load the system only with excessive "paper junk" in this way, and those ones that search gaps in the system considerably more simply have it to exploit the system than if the threshold values remained higher.
You talk about the problems during the practical conversion of the Czech allocation law.
How does the control system system function in Germany?
There is here a similar authority as our NKÚ, or does the system function differently?
What affects the authorities, so the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Audit Office that is similarly built up as with us and is in charge also of a college that only something is formed differently. Fundamentally both authorities work, however, similarly.
Also the competences are comparable to a certain measure, at what Germany, however, is a Federal state, that is that there are these courts of auditors also in the single federal states - the German system distinguishes in that from ours.
What corresponds to our state means may control only federal means to the BRH.
Public means which are administered by the districts and municipalities with us are subjected there to the control of the country courts of auditors.
What affects the German legislation is that one simpler than ours?
Generally I would compare this without concrete information only reluctantly. Nevertheless Germany in a way some ways is called often model with the case of which one can say that Germany is better in everything, however, not designated.
Is that due maybe to there the testers being better?
That does not determine, however as said: I do not like such comparisons especially gladly.
To that it is still to be said that also the countries which are a model for us have to fight also with problems.
Otherwise they would not have yes anything of a cooperation with our authority, not true?
What affects the Czech legislation, which importance had the amendment of the allocation law for your authority, you already sense any effects?
In view of that, that this novelette is first short time in force, does not affect it with the case of our examinations up to now yet.
Since our controls subsequently occur, one must reckon a certain delay here.
We verspüren effects up to now rather in the preparatory phase of future controls - so have introduced we the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of the Unwirtschaftlichkeit and checked with this almost 14,000 public tasks and analyzed -" here the changes will affect as a matter of course since the threshold values are changed that conditions for certain kinds were modified by announcements among other things.
See the discharge of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law in a certain way is a step into the correct direction and hopes that this assumption is confirmed.
The problem that the rules become "more severe" and cannot be kept anymore can occur, however.
Already under the previous rules the persons subjected to an examination are opposite the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational program of the regional policy, the regional council) in such a way accountable, that every noncompliance of the allocation law of an injury of the budget discipline amounts.
Is it then reasonable, however, to make the law even more severe?
My opinion's not in this way.
The system must exclude those ones that attack and want to misuse, and do not punish the system.
Only the bureaucracy puts such a system under even bigger pressure.
Where is the way out here?
We say at first once, which way is not objective-leading.
The prime minister said recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what that is called exactly?
Is the black-system now forbidden or allowed?
A law must have nevertheless his validity, and if something is by law prohibited, nevertheless the government chairperson can simply not come then, and hinder the control office whose duty now is the control of the compliance of the law in his activity.
He can say: "We change the law and allow the thing", however he cannot say that we do so than if nothing was.
The allocation law contains relatively severe rules of processes specific about the formal carrying out - and that is also correct for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand it is, however, also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone due to irregularities is excluded.
The law will never be complete, but it must be used correct - and that is that what with us of my opinion is missing.
