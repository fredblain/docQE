Old combats, new Near east
The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could prove to be unexpected keystone for the peace
Can there be ever continuous peace between Arabs and Jews in the Near East?
The newest bloody events seem such hope in the germ to suffocate.
Among the usual fault assignments countless buildings were put into debris and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, civilians, and six Israelis killed most from that - and for the first time missiles struck from Gaza near the Israeli Tel Aviv metropolis and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historical conflict, the Near east changes around them around.
The Arabian spring created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis became part of these disorders.
Maybe this will lead only to more bloodsheds.
However, there are reasons for the assumption that the fatal stalemate situation could find their end at last.
A war, which neither did not lose still is won
At first sight optimism seems all but made faced with the current situation.
Even if that one agreed on 21st November armistice stops, the dieswöchigen fights fortified the hard-boiled ones on both pages.
The chiefs of the Hamas, the Islamic movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will say from themselves to have pushed the Israelis back although his grouping itself had to record great losses.
Although several Hamas-Führer are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip penned in in one of the corners of the planet most desolate and thickly most populated, Israel did not succeed until now in destroying the Hamas.
In fact the Hamas wins in the West Bank, that of the rival one, moderate Palestinian group Fatah is controlled.
And that to Hamas-Führer could come to the end, that they have the time on their page.
The way Islamisten gained influence in the Arabian world the Hamas had been able to pull powerful and rich friends onto their page.
Turkey, a power being strengthened again, regional that once was regarded as Israel's narrowest Muslim ally took for the Hamas party - exactly as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf State.
Jubilant Hamas-Anhänger believe that an Islamic half-moon forms itself around Israel - of Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has the power, above Syria, where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren coining could be before the Stürzung Bashar Assads, up to Jordan, where Hamas-Verbündete threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under president Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the Arabian country inhabitant-strongest with distance and most important - at the southern flank of Israel changed the balance of the region lastingly.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizistische despot that ruled over Egypt up to his fall 2011 for 30 years had only little time for the Hamas remaining.
In contrast the brotherhood is verschwägert with the Hamas and their chiefs stronger dependent on nation opinions.
In the case of future diplomatic negotiations the Hamas could prove to be protagonist that cannot be herausgedrängt even by Israel and the United States.
On the other hand let to the Israeli hardliners draw an opposite conclusion.
The Hamas is seen military no danger anymore.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", had been able to persist and many of the Hamas-Raketen were destroyed.
At least a while long Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic respect the United States hold on unshakeably to their position. Many European countries made the Hamas responsible for the newest power escalations.
Israel did well in last years, in particular under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu who ignored the peace process to big parts.
Although missiles killed about 30 Israelis from the Gaza stripe since 2004, the country remained relative freely from suicide assassins - last but not least thanks to the blocking-installations, that run into the West Bank and in this way into the main part of a possible Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements which were declared indeed as international law adverse, yet are extended always further.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud-party allied with an even more combative group in the front end of the choices on the 22nd January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why also these crafty Palestinians pamper and leave an own state with them?
If in fact they had the control of the West Bank, they would not fire off then also missiles exactly as their combatants in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better, to hold behind the wall in chess and to punish they, they should dare to lift the heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to assert. Nevertheless the Arabian spring could make them a line through the bill.
Self when the Islamisten that now are in Egypt and in other countries at the power have little remaining for Israel, they will concentrate first of all on the difficulties in the own country.
The defense appropriation of Israel is greater together than that of his four Arabian neighbors is.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arabian governments during the repair of their economy.
That the pragmatic president Mursi put together with Barack Obama in order to achieve an armistice could be a promising sign - and symbolize maybe the beginning of a new era.
Also Israelis should think more on a long-term basis.
While the remaining Arabian world is doing timid steps in the direction of democratization, Palestinians keep on being robbed of their self-determination right - a powder keg that will explode beyond doubt one day in the in an Israeli manner busy fields exactly as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The suppression untergräbt already now the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arabian population this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to the Zurückdrängung of the Hamas in the Gaza-stripe will require their diplomatic toll increasingly over the years.
Both pages require an impulse from outside
The correct answer is that, that of the more reasonable representatives of both pages, the majority of the remaining world and of this newspaper will represent: Two states near which Israel to security purposes hands over fields.
The - for the near future small - hope consists in the armistice giving external more influence for the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must stop now the arm deliveries together with Turkey and Qatar in the Gaza patrols and is better positioned than ever before, around the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on basis of the borders of 1967, complemented with field exchange and a common Jerusalem, to convince.
External Arabian nations should convince also the Hamas and Fatah of an agreement.
In this way would be done for the creation of a Palestinian state more than with the imminent request for UN observer statuses.
Also Obama must contribute his part to convincing Israel of negotiations.
During his first term of office he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
It seems far remote in the White House as if it were averse to a participation in the same way.
However, that is a regrettable, shortsighted perspective.
The United States have an essential interest at a stable Near east.
And a peace agreement belongs to that between Israel and the Palestinians.
