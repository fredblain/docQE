Australian laws for homogeneous cigarette packagings come into force
Health warnings and sick parts of the body on neutral green packages that are identical for all tobacco brands
The worldwide first laws came for homogeneous cigarette and tobacco packagings into force in Australia. In this way brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive-green lids that in addition are printed with drastic pictures that show sick parts of the body and babies sick through cigarette smoke and children.
From the different health warnings and pictures once foreseen the only difference consists from coming Saturday between the packages in the brand names that are printed in identical, small writing.
In this way Australia introduces the worldwide most severe regulations for tobacco packagings.
The Australian Federal Government wants to talk out young people of the smoking when the glamorous picture of the tobacco consumption is removed.
The government takes as a basis studies that showed that people, that with 26 still not have started smoking with 99%-iger probability also after that no more will begin.
"One can see already with children of young age that they understand the message the tobacco company groups with their brand picture apply attempt", according to federal minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies which for example showed that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia shows one of the least smoker rates of the world and the changes will affect the profits of the multinational company groups only insignificantly, other countries consider already similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought in a hard way against the laws.
So it was said with the laws the black market trade would be favored, what too cheaper and easy accessible cigarettes leads.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian forgers will offer by far greater amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.
Say others on the other hand that the laws stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, says, that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to the covering of the intolerable packagings have gone up enormous, since the company groups British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the uppermost Australian court of justice failed with their contestation of the laws.
Zico sold wholesale businesses up to 6,000 units and waits for new supplies.
For us that is a good business.
According to experts the hook is in the popularity of social media near exactly the population group which the plan consults.
Tabakkonzerne banished a series of Australian laws from the TV advertising, forbidden it to them, as sport sponsors occur and most traders in order not to design cigarettes longer in businesses forced. Now the tobacco advertising is changed into the Internet.
The Australian government forbade internet advertising through local enterprises and pages, does not have, however, any influence on international pages.
"Who commercializes tobacco and has only a small field remaining, to apply around his products, does not get about around the Internet", Becky Freeman, researcher, says in the health service at the Sydney university.
On social media as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman found a rise at field reports to brands that were written by "very normal people".
One must ask oneself the question: That is only a private person that thinks so great favor of Marlboro cigarettes that she receives even a video for that - or a marketing agency in this way has to do?
British American Tobacco Australia says, that the industry instead of on marketing on that concentrates, to deal with the new laws.
It went even so far, to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic in order to contest the new regulations - those countries complain with the case of the world trade organization about unfair commercial restrictions although no one of the countries runs greater trade with Australia.
A WTO-decision is expected for middle in 2013.
According to Plibersek the government led conversations with other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was in 2001 the first country to stipulate photographic warnings.
In the meantime these onto more than 40 countries were expanded, under that Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves defiantly.
The pictures do not influence me.
I simply ignore it.
"One simply takes an edge and puts the box away", says Victor El Hage during the purchase of a cigarette packet, on whom a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly said it gives only a reason why I would stop, and that is my small girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city of Sydney, says the homogeneous packaging complicated the filling up of his shelves.
"Formerly I needed an hour in order to sort a delivery, now I need four", Yu says.
"The government should simply completely have forbidden cigarettes - then we would have said ourselves okay, that was it, we make thick, he matches visibly infuriates in addition".
