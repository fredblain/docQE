"PSG is not the FC Barcelona"!
In this season you accepted a new extent with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can declare it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Splendid players came.
I make progress daily at their page.
The technical personnel gave me also a lot.
These elements encourage me daily to correcting my game level.
And with the case of a game this is even simpler.
In the soccer everything goes very quickly.
But I do not burst out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preliminary training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time with Saint-Etienne I have done always step-by-step progress.
You do thus the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti zunutze...
The new records of this summer are accustomed at delivering games of very high level.
You also know that every training unit is decisive.
This provides, that a player must offer as I, the forehead and wants to give his best.
After all the way Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot with respect to my game position.
He is supported by co-coaches as Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the correct person for the task?
Natural.
Ancelotti instills respect into all technicians.
In the Ligue 1 there is not currently any comparable person, and it numbers among the best coaches of Europe.
He looks back upon a rich experience and won many titles with associations looked at.
He had contact with tall players.
I think that he will win further titles in Paris.
In January I held an encouraging conversation with it.
Then I had recovered just from an injury series.
The confidence which he put in me is also a declaration for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyons took the place of the top rider from us.
We lurk, however, in the ambush.
One of our most important objectives is the champions League: we qualified in this manner for the round of 16.
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
We will attempt to come so far as possibly.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak our word against very good European teams.
First of all we want to become First of our group for postage so that we can deliver the RÃ¼ckspiel of the round of 16 as a home match.
Can the PSG in the short term become a large European association?
He has already the budget for that...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win titles and make a name to itself on a long-term basis.
This is not today the case.
Financially the PSG gives himself the means so that this intention accepts concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 as this was the case in the last season?
This would be natural a great disappointment.
This year creaming off this title really suits to us at the heart.
In the last season we were thick at that.
In May we were disappointed since we were strong enough in order to suffer the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong achievement.
We closed with 79 points.
Usually one should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year the correct one is.
Even if the large teams as Marseille, Lyons or Bordeaux struggle for the title, I believe that we have the stuff in order to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG?
In Anbetracht of that, what was invested and the players that we have it is normal that a lot by us is expected.
We accept the complete.
If we, however, win at a home match against Troyes 4-0, and one still finds something which one can reproach us for, that with security is a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people still expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We attempt to make a game draft.
A team builds itself up with the time.
In the champions we proved League to strength.
You consider Manchester town, an association the since two seasons does not create to qualify for the round of 16 and has made the also gigantic editions!
With regard to the invested sums one believed projection of you for the game pause with 15 points!
That would be called, that our opponents and the French championship except for care would be let.
Lyons and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, became "geboostet" from this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is thrilling.
I hope for our being the smiling winner in the month of May and saying ourselves that finally we won it in spite of all difficulties.
The PSG completely seems to be dependent from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better, that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependence".
That is, that Ibrahimovic is efficient and fires many gates.
Therefore it came and it proves that he the star is the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he played, it made clear, that it a splendid player is and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He respects also the persons who surround it.
What it achieved is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to correcting their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is to one of the best defenders worldwide, also facilitates it all other to do progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
Participating in this EM suited to me at the heart.
Unfortunately my injury hindered me at knocking out some playing time.
I saw there things which I followed from fortified.
Today I succeed in realizing good games in the national team.
This was since my baptism with the "blue's" my hope.
From what happened in Ukraine we drew our lesson, and today we must put an exemplary behavior on the day.
Which opinion have you to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "blue's"?
It achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to the victory.
How it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to do any comparison.
Blanc had reached his objective when it had qualified us for the EM.
I hope, that Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue's" to Brazil.
Does the draw forced on the 16th October in Spain (1:1) represent a prelude game?
This game gave us to confidence.
Everyone supported all others.
Before this concurrence in Spain I have never yet experienced a comparable game in my career.
