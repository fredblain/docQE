"South America must learn during the integration of the citizens", says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship "is" an objective with the case of which "in fact South America can learn something of Europe."
"Correa who participated in the 6th summit conference of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) to occur in Lima declared the state television in Peru" that the Europeans "in the second world war and in other quarrels killed" themselves and are today practically a homeland."
In this sense he defended the project, to create a South American citizenship that the member states of the Unasur drive forward.
"The free traffic of the citizens and workers in all South American countries Must be achieved, how the case ist;es already in the Andes community gives this, however, still reactionary sectors that strive for a return into the past", it warned.
The president of Ecuador in addition approved the rearrangement layout of the organization of American states (OEA) under the handicap, to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to consider those that signed the agreement of San José about human rights.
Those that teach never commit themselves to something, and in the corresponding train for this purpose we the South Americans sign always everything.
"It is unintelligible that the inter-American commission has their seat for human rights in Washington and is financed by the United States", it declared as an allusion to the political asylum, the Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has given.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles in this way but his "deep democratic values and opinions about human rights has come later.
He added, that at that time it "justified suppositions has given, that Assange would be delivered to a third country and his procedure not be kept."
It in addition criticized the Swedish justice which demanded from it to subject it to an interrogation on his state field because of an alleged Sexualdelikts while "the Swedish jurisdiction is allowing this by means of a video conference which could have been carried out over the message of Ecuador in London."
Correa declared that the danger would exist that the health and the psychological state of Assange would be influenced.
"Since it is in our message, I did not speak with it, the ambassadress informed me, however, of his having an easy problem with the lungs, however, none fatal", the head of state of Ecuador said.
The danger that it would take physical and psychological damage because it is caught in a narrow room and cannot carry out any physical exercises in the open air withstands it, however.
"That would influence the health of every human being", he added.
Correa served, that the solution for the asylum that was given to Assange since the month of June in the message of Ecuador in London is the grant of a charter with which he can travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Swedes and the juridical authorities Europa's. It underlined that there were conversations with London in order to find a solution for the founder of WikiLeaks locked up.
We do not sell the human rights, we do not use this word for this case, there were, however, constant conversations.
"The solution for this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Swedes and the juridical authorities of Europe because the attorney leads a row from Assange, Baltazar Garzón, of procedures on different European authorities", it declared.
And "if morning gives this charter to Great Britain, this is in my opinion done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or above Skype as it approves the Swedish jurisdiction and was made in other cases, the problem is done.
Correa took the opportunity, in order to be confirmed as defenders of the freedom of the press and said, that what he" does not "tolerate", this mediocrity that bad intention and the lie that invalidates the free opinion comment are."
"The tallest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the bad and perverted politicians, but bad journalists that strive for profit and blackmail", he said.
In this sense he congratulated himself, "that Ecuador is not governed by the bankers or hegemonic and spit middle class countries anymore of such journalists and neither", and anticipated, that it "will deepen" with the case of a re-election "the revolution, in order to continue the way into this correct direction."
Correa supported also the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to his next choices in the case of which he argued that the organism "must stay "hard and no opportunism and none as a coup dressed up legal may allow", because "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay was destroyed" by that.
The president of Ecuador in addition holds the wish of his Colombian vis-a-vis, Juan Manuel Santos, now and to discuss the lake-legal borders between both countries according to the judgment of the International court of justice of The Hague, which divided the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua, for "completely entitled."
At the present time this judgment is not transformed.
It is a question of a problem between one south- and a Central American state.
Conflicts are unavoidable, they must be overcome, however, in the aspiration to a common way.
You must be treated comprehensively so that one can overcome it and look forward.
In the same way he trusted in a good end of the quarrels about the lake borders between Peru and Chile in front of the same court of justice and meant that it is correct for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries sign up to accept the judgment himself if it in a very hard way breaks down."
With respect to the possibility that he positions himself into Ecuador as a candidate for the next premiership choices in order to reach his third mandate in consequence he served, that it this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy sees although sometimes it is difficult also very much."
Correa assured that he would withdraw from the political life if he lost the choices in February 2013.
Power has never interested me personally, but under so unfair circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was it that guaranteed this probable victory, therefore I must follow this responsibility", he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as a president, after that I withdraw from the public life.
This is valid also if we lose.
"That is decisive", it declared.
Correa took Bezug of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, also onto the treatment of the sanitary problems of the president in Cuba.
I spoke just with the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He said to me that he traveled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that it would be expected that he can travel to Cuba after the choice campaign again.
It commented, "It does not mean a relapse in any case in the health state of the president Chávez".
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in the 6th summit conference of the state and government leaders of the union of South American nations (Unasur) that was ended with the call for a higher regional integration in order to guarantee for a lasting progress, equality and security in Lima.
