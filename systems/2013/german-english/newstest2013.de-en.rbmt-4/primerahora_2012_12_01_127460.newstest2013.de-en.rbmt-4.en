Héctor "Hetin" Of Reyes: "Basketball was my living"
The globetrotter of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was associated to the basket sport longer than 60 years and bereist the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a so big intellectual collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Of Reyes.
Before it was tied to the rotation chair by a stroke in the year 2008, Rexes was for 6 years part of this sport, it is to the first national league, to authorized representative and to conductor in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or to president of the basketball association as players of lower classes, players.
"My life long I put myself on many hats in the basketball, even several simultaneously when I was president of the BSN, main manager of the national team and president of the association in the nineties" Reyes remembered at a visit of Primera Hora with it at home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his true wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career almost all and testify.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that remind of his time at the Vaqueros of the middle of the fifties as players to 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year long anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or managers of the club.
"Those ones were my best years that I enjoyed the most because I am a part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 it than were allowed to be managers, Mitgeschäftsführer or coaches.
There were years fulfilling many, including the five championships after each other of 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
Off then took over "Cuco" Ortiz that was a very good manager" says Reyes.
I still know that Gene said Bartow which worked as a coach here and was done by Alabama (Birmingham) at the university to me: "I have a player very strong and 2 m tall.
You would like it"?
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow recommended after that the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse who could be naturalized and was one of our best throwers.
I still know how he said that Gausse would worry for another if Mincy had facilitated a championship for Bayamon.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was given to him, however already out of a distance, because it already stood in 1988 at uppermost place of the association.
At this time he preferred to enjoy his enforcements and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won for the first time during the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the USA.
After that the world championship came in 1990, at which we the fourth place occupied, Reyes said what actually bronze should have been if this Canadian referee had not been that made us the last game train for the second time repeat.
Was this group of the world championship 1990 the best national team which you ever saw?
It belongs to the best, as also those who won during the Olympiad 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite is, however, the team of the Pan-American games 1991 in Cuba, where we extracted gold and offered a fight to the team of the USA, as, when they extracted bronze against us during the world championship.
Near that team only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were not again in this case, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Of Morales that could not be in 1990 because of a knee injury in this case.
A team which maybe was not the best with which we, however, won a gold medal and which prepared great joy for us with respect to personalities was that of the vorolympischen tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players as "Canito" Of Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as substitute for the banned players because of the incidents on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal towards every prediction.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was Piculín Ortiz without doubts.
His numbers on level of the international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico dominated on this level so as Piculín did.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a series of good coaches as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What believes you is the best thing that you achieved in the association?
I was a part of the most successful era of the national team of 1988 to 1995 which the BSN grasped to up to 17 teams at the beginning of the nineties in a season.
Does what still doing remain to you?
There are things which I would have imported as e.g. the regionalization of the lower categories.
That play the Jungs in Ponce e.g. only in their field and stumble on teams first in the national Playoffs from other corners of the island.
Today the children do unnecessarily many journeys and games.
At least I see the result of the stipulated training and courses in coaches, table-official ones and referees.
On that I am proud.
What do you do today?
I hear music gladly, sees videos of music of my time in YouTube enjoys, my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel who was always at my page.
