Ministry of the Interior Office ignores illegal arm market
Part of legal arms at crimes extremely small
The Russian Ministry of the Interior Office plans a sharpening of the arm law for private arm owners.
In this way the authorities react to the recent events: Injured persons with the case of gunfights on weddings as well as seven dead during the amok race of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to forbid the carrying of non-fatal-deadly arms in public and raise the age for the possession of firearms of 18 onto 21 years.
The chairperson of the Duma-committee supported the proposal for security and corruption abatement, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the changes to the arm law shortly are presented to the Duma.
Not they are all satisfied with the Russian authorities wanting to oppose the problems through "Attraction of the screws".
In the Internet an open letter was published, that authors - representative of different arm associations - demand from the authorities, to refrain from "senseless sharpenings".
The percent of the crimes with registered arms is very small, the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC, expressed.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior Office 142 crimes with application of the registered arms were committed during six months in 2012 while for the same period in total 1.168 thousand offenses were being noted.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a sharpening of the law will not keep for private arm owners criminals from serving oneself on the black market.
At the time of one can find according to the authors in Moscow every possible arm for little money.
Meanwhile the Ministry of the Interior Office stresses that the circulation of illegal arms is under control.
Suppliers: of the factories up to the officers
The arms reach over several channels on the black market.
There are such forward channels channels to five tells former colonel Viktor Baranez, who was active ten years in the education ministry and in the general staff.

The first channel is the army and/or the military, that is arms that were stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The arms were stolen both by the Russian officers as also the Caucasians themselves", says Baranez.
On the second channel illegal arms come which are stolen from order guardians by criminals.
Baranez explains that arms which both from the armories of the police and directly were stolen by employees of the prosecution authorities number among that.
Further illegally sold arms come from military arm warehouses.
Near many military camps it resulted frequently in explosions.
"There are proofs that it was a question of arson in some cases in order to hush up the absence of arms", says the former military member.
Also the arm manufacturers achieve a contribution to the black market according to Baranez.
"Nowadays there are innumerable private armament factories, not stand firm that of the international competition and therefore the arms secretly on the black market, about instance in Moscow, squander", the expert tells.
A further channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries as Kyrgyzstan.
"Over there there are an own, sometimes handicraft production as well as a Mafia which organizes the smuggling, explains the former military member.
From where do the arms come?
Experts calculated, which part each of the five channels has at the supply of the black market of illegal arms approximately.
In the year 2011 a report by the center was written for problem analyses and state administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior Office and the Federal service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the topic arms.
The predominant part of the illegal arms comes according to the observers from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Is half of all arms on the black market there through the "fault of persons responsible in charge, who have to do in their work with arms reaches", it is called in the report.
According to the data of the researchers 17% of the arms come from conflict fields, 14% go back to thefts during the arm production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sale consultant of an arm shop which does not want to be named in particular assures that nobody already long buys arms which are found in the case of illegal excavations anymore since they went out of date.
According to it it is more frequent that traders get themselves the supplies in an arm warehouse.
About an officer cadet an arm, for example a pistol of the type TT, is bought.
The arm is switched off and handed over through the fence.
"The trader brings the arm into the city and sells it there for 900 euros apiece with two magazines", he tells
"The police know answer of course above all and carry out therefore periodically control purchases with traders which illegal arms offer if she cannot keep to the plan for the exposure of crimes" adds the sale consultant.
"As in the luxury loading"
Buyers and sales assistants think of the most frequent about acquaintances to each other.
I had had a look at web pages and blogs, than somebody onto me became attentive and to me suggested to the station to come "To Begowaja, where a person would wait for me, that would bring me onto a certain place" where we could discuss the price then.
I found out the price for the arm first there

"In order to get an arm, I need an acquaintance who has contacts", tells the sale consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I do not trust in it".
There are traders on the markets, nevertheless there one must go and arrange to see with a code as "of Iwan Iwanowitsch, who can orientate, that the daughter lost a tooth".
I come currently even onto some brass knuckles about an acquaintance who I trust in.
It also provides me with the brass knuckles only therefore because he knows that I it not verpfeife.
Newcomers search for arms on different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried in the middle of the 1990th as buyers of illegal arms when he wrote an article on this topic.
The pattern's's have changed according to it not.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt myself as in the luxury loading", the military member remembers.
The buyer does not get the cat according to Baranez in the bag, but he can try out everything.
I than potential customer does only simply not buy, but he goes with the sales assistant into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can fire then there, and if I am convinced by that, that the arm has a good shot, we negotiate "with each other", the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search result to web pages and groups in "Vkontakte" where arms are offered "for different purposes".
Neither any papers are not needed still there are personal meetings.
"You need only the suitable sum money", it is said in the advertisement on the web page "Buy combat pistol or rifle".
There users give up your orders and inquiries set.
Are also minors sold to?
"Natural without license", user "Iwan" (literal quotation) asks.
"A TT buys. Moscow", the laconic inquiry of "Fedorenkow" says.
The Federal Security Service switched recently innumerable appearance web pages, and buyer, that arms want to gain, go to the service zuhauf into the net.
The people come as hungry fish with the case of the feeding and arrive then in Siberia and may shovel coal

I heard about following pattern: The web page is registered usually abroad, and Russian laws do not find any application.
The persons responsible in charge accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money above a bank automat.
"He receives as an answer a photo and a description of the cache of the arm", tells the press agent of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that one can go out also emptily to the end, when one places an inquiry on a web page, and come behind gratings.
The Federal Security Service switched recently innumerable appearance web pages, and buyer, that arms want to gain, go to the service zuhauf into the net.
"The people come as hungry fish with the case of the feeding and arrive then in the sibirischen labor camp and may shovel coal", he says.
A Makarow for 100 United States dollars
During the purchase of illegal firearms prices of 100 to 900 United States dollars are to be reckoned according to experts.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" one can buy a pistol of the type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
One must wait up to one months.
The arm is distributed in military arm warehouses by minders of middle rank.
