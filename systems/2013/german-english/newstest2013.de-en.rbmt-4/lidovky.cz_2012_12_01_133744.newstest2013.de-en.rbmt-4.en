The film Argo: Wenn's most badly stands, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob of demonstrating Islamic students filled the US American message in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release they demanded the delivery over of the Schahs Mohammad Reza Pahlavi brought down who had fled into the USA which had preserved the patronage over decades about his regime after the revolution.
For the American government there was not from this situation any positive way out - she could not afford to fling the Schah overboard there this the confidence of their allies in other countries massive would have damaged.
It was not simultaneous in the situation, in Iran, where the revolution led to the use of a theocratic regime, to put through the release of the hostages.
It was a difficult stroke for the call of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco during the violent attempt of the hostage liberation made everything only even worse.
Finally the captured diplomats were released after 444 days after negotiations had been provided through the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of the solidarity as well as anti-Iranian atmospheres at home.
The collapse in Iran contributed considerably to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan at the premiership choices in the year 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history which brought a small partial victory to the USA.
Immediately before the occupation of the message six message employees succeeded in the flight.
This ended according to numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA succeeded in collaboration with the Canadian authorities in bringing the refugees from Iran; in this case an extravagant story for the Verdeckung of their true identity helped them - they traveled with Canadian passports camouflagedly as members of a film stick that supposedly went to locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by the expert for "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, required also the cooperation of Hollywood.
So that the camouflage became credible, articles were published about this film project in technical journals papers, press conferences were kept off, and the fictitious production society had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept a secret long. The film is based on the memories from Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand he is a realistic Politthriller, simultaneously, however, also a so-called "Caper Movie", that is the history of a succeeded coup de main as for example the film Ocean's Eleven.
Through that the atmosphere levels are changed in the film off - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film composure of the same situations there are not any great differences).
On the other hand the loose passages from Hollywood that ironically and slightly Ã¼berspitzt come from there.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the discussion table, on the office fields, at the telephone...
Ben Affleck succeeded in a remarkable restart start of his career with this film.
From an actor smiled at one became respectable director, and also as an actor he is not now the objective of ironic comments anymore.
Argo is not his third feature film after the thriller Any Children's Game's Play (Centesimal degrees baby centesimal degrees, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).
Simultaneously it is Afflecks first film not to play in the native Boston of the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place belonged in this case to the features which removed the previous films of this director from the standard of Hollywood.
Affleck proves this feeling, however, also in Argo, where Tehran "is played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really occurred - the input sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in their clarity, and nevertheless provides in this case the feeling of the Verwirrtheit and the Unvorhersehbarkeit that sets in if the history moves somewhere once.
A similar effect achieves Affleck with his team also with the case of fictitious scenes (the wrong film stick on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action at too many places
The director had to deal also with actually the history not offering many scenes being tight in the cinematic sense.
With the Little which he helps the reality with sometimes a little it works, however, quite successfully - what then does not work always so elegantly (the scenes, in which the threatening crisis is averted from a telephone call on the airport in Tehran in America, or also the pursuit hunt on the runway, seem a little artificial).
The weakness of Argo is to have to show his far too wide dispersion which is necessitated by the necessity too much at action at too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very much indeed charming in their roles as Hollywood-employees, their figures would have earned, however, more room, and in this way they do not stand alone by far in the film.
Afflecks film loses attraction a little through that. It is a film, that one pursue with certain interest and in this case the organization and the one goutieren onto retro-style reminding a thriller from the 70th years can.
It wakes enthusiasm only heavily, however.
As memory at one until today in certain way live piece history and as an evidence of that as cladded, however, the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are it is sufficient, however.
