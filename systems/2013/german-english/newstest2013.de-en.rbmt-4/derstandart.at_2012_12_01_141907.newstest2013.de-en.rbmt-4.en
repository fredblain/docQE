The MVRDV architects prove, that the true adventures are not only in the head - at the example of Spijkenisse and the recently constructed book mountain - 2 photos
"I find the building merry, it looks futuristic, and seeing something interesting again at last gives", says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by, at the street edge.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large-scale enterprise seemed likely, means: "However it is beautiful already, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today still.
They all have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No human being goes today voluntarily yet into one of these Old-Style-Bibliotheken, or?
Spijkenisse, a hardly inspection-needy sleep city in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant-municipality shows the lowest education rate of the entire Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, one decided on contributing to the general education and reproducing the seven fictitious bridges which are represented on the euro appearances as prettily painted reinforced concrete miniatures some years ago.
The success of the education offensive held itself in borders.
And so the city fathers recognized that there would be only an only possibility, to become gentleman the statistics: A library must here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architect's office MVRDV, master of the reckless bar graphs and producer of witty, really often cynical constructions, took the thing with usual composure and appeared for the competition-hearing anno 2003 with five books among the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury was looking still baffledly around itself and twitching with the armpits, stacked the insolent Meuse his exquisite little presents of the size after to a pyramid and his aktionistisch supported speech with the words ended: "Love municipality"!
It is that therefore, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later the mountain 30 million euros expensive is heaped up.
He is a part of a revitalization project which also basement garage, supermarket, mail office and a few bordering living and row houses with in total 50 apartments belong to.
At the beginning of November "Best library" was characterized the book mountain with the second price "of NL 2012".
In addition the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
In this way the faceless small town retort is, that until dato more did not have to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a consternatedly ugly city hall behind whose white facades one would be inclined to presume a dairy factory around a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Particularly, however, Spijkenisse has now the first public culture construction in the history of his existing.
The long way for the book
The first impression: Book Eldorado under cheese dish with glass cover.
There is indeed a lift that leads right through the massif, however, the true room and reading joys open up at the fußläufigen Climb Up the topography.
The rundum glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker ground and the elegant street-lamps speak unmistakably the language of a public city place.
The urbane ambience is perfect.
One holds already look-out of Jungs playing to park bench, dog and soccer and girl.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle a big, dark room lies which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We put the classical room configuration on the head and put the read area to the outside from inside.
The interior of the Bücherbergs is skillfully used: In the middle offices, internet-library, Schachclub, environmental center and housing technical services headquarters lie.
The black bookshelves are a special joy, the once wall paneling, once parapet, once staircase rail are.
Optics, Haptik and odor are strange.
Even confirmed architects and civil engineers engineers shake the unknown material's the head.
"We wanted to work here with recycling-materials", declares Joop Trouborst, project leader manager near the municipality Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so we found a suitable waste product in a friesländischen farm of a day from the agriculture.
For many years one is using a millimeter-thin synthetic fleece as a root pad in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields.
That is cheap and time-efficient.
To the thin textile keeps, two Saisonen, after that it is ripe for the bulky waste.
For the library the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these amounts - to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat action and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, load-capable material which smells a bissl to new cars and a bissl to trainer discolors itself.
To 105 stages one arrived at the peak.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long journey one is rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic prospect on the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted Ficusbäumen.
You guarantee for Atmosphäre, for, however, for the correct humidity, in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"One would not believe it, but this house is a showing-project as regards in spite of the many glass faces ecology", says Trouborst.
Heated and chilled becomes with geothermal heat.
Although the book mountain stands under a glass fall, the sun shines even on sunny days only shortly into the interior.
The wide wood glue ties that stand perpendicular to the glass facade are used as shading and catch a majority of the solar radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Finish the rest fully automatic window blind.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT branch, risked already the way into the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde that "for a long time overdue soul" even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisses.
The reason: For the opening few weeks ago every inhabitant was invited to to donate a book from his personal supply.
The optical gaps are supposed to be filled with that for the time being once in the library completely not equipped yet - currently 70,000 pieces.
The draft opened.
The shelves are to obenhin filled.
"Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library is", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation every inhabitant has now a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to the glory.
In this way MVRDV succeeded in that royal discipline which one mentions identity foundation in the jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote history of literature.
So jung und ungebildet they also likes to be.
That is at last a starting point for identity once.
