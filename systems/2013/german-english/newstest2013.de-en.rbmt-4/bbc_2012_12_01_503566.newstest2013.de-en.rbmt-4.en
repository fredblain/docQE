Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the smelliest fish of the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and that not only in Europe, but on the whole world.
Could putting something with the local appetite onto quite smelly fish have the success secret of the country?
One takes a selection of overripe cheese sorts.
One seats her among a heap of dirty, moist sportswear.
And she leaves a week there.
So approximately one must imagine the nose-deadening odor of Rakfisk, one of the big delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small city of Fagernes, removed by Oslo about three hours.
There is here snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn odor in the air that does simply not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is trout strewed salt on, that - dependent on that, how being fed up one would have his fish gladly - up to a year in water is fermented.
If into Norway the darkness about the country comes and the weather becomes colder, Norwegians for a celebration flow here into Fagernes, that this is dedicated, now, really very bribing specialty.
"One eats it rawly and rinses it then with a glass of Aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but organizes also the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-general".
Consume around us around people small fish dies and tall amounts take for this purpose onto alcohol to themselves.
"Like sludges people the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk", Havard says.
The spirit can replace the odor.
I taste some morsels.
If one avoids to bring the Rakfisk into nose proximity, it is not bad - about instance as sushi that has a quite long bus journey behind themselves.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, by far poorer Norwegian epoch than there were not yet any cool possibilities and fish was soaked in the fall in airtight salt water barrels.
In the deepest winter it was arrogated then after long Fermentierung and - beyond doubt under senses subdued with the aid of alcohol - is consumed.
Still before a generation thousands of Norwegians were seen forced in search of work, to leave their country and emigrated mainly to the USA.
Today the population increases rapidly - more than 13% are, attracted from a flourishing labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health service, to immigrant.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, that was before not yet far too long time by far richer as Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - than an essential, when part of the Norwegian history smelling also severely.
He belongs to the more expensive courts which one can buy for oneself here.
However, actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not get it often into the world press, and most people seems to disturb that not.
Here one hates still to name Anders Breivik with the case of the name - that racist right extremist that shot 77 men, women and children to death last year.
Instead of this one refers only to the "incident of the 22nd July".
Norwegians are for themselves heavily with accepting that somebody is capable in their peace-loving country for such brutal murders.
The growth of one of the greatest oil and gas industries of the world is Head-Responsible for the present fortune of Norway since the early 1970th years.
"The only reason is not Aber oil why we are so fine", Anna, our waitress, says the distributed round trays with ripe Rakfisk and embodied with their long fair hair and the prickingly blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are - how one says - circumspect nation.
Your English is exactly here immaculate as that of most people.
We are not very boastful, we do not like any pomposity.
Norway dealt with his oil fortune very cautiously - a big part of the branch profits is invested in a special fund for the welfare of future generations.
When in the years up to the world economy crisis all with money around themselves that they did not own at all flung, Norway held his purse shut.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go in the summer rambling, we are happy", says Anna.
"And, she adds "to eat Rakfisk of course" with care free laughter.
I stand in the snow and act for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an Elch-Burger is in any case something else. I like the juicy meat.
But at the evening the being fed up fish stands again on the food plan.
The hotel at which I stay is one of several places of event which organize a Rakfisk-dinner in the case of which guests can vote for the best - or provoking maybe the senses of smell most strongly - fish.
There is a Live-TV-circuit to a show master covered with fly which is surrounded from plates with Rakfisk.
The racket resembles the Eurovision song Contest.
"Which dot number you have there above in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-JÃ¼rgen?
"Here our points, Havard, are".
One claps and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed from the Aquavit.
However, maybe it is nevertheless the severe haze of the whole fish.
