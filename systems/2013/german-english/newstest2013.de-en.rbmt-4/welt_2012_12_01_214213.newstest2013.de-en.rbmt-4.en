Drink butter daily - and 168 years old become
In the south of Azerbaijan many people achieve a biblicalally high age.
There is even a museum of longevity.

In the south of Azerbaijan many people achieve a biblicalally high age.

A tracing in the country, in which 97-year still comparably young are.
The journey through the Talysch-mountains is to be called game-romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the street full of bends, past at thickly wooded hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one could think one was in the Black Forest.
However that here the deepest south of Azerbaijan is, the border to Iran is only few kilometers away.
Here the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyschen lives from which much is not known unless she speaks Persian as well as Aserisch perfectly and is very long-lasting.
Terminal is Lerik.
The small small town shows off with too wuchtig guessed architecture from Soviet times that does not want to fit so at all in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come hardly here, the journey of Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too cumbersome.
One needs eight hours for the 323 kilometers because the street is only one lane.
The fabulous fortune which the country owes to his oil in the Caspian Sea did not arrive here in the province yet.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced from that of Lerik having the stuff to the tourist attraction.
"Baku became in May famous with the Eurovision song festival - and in the next year we have a festival of the oldest people of the world here," Fatulayeva says".
She is the directress of the museum of longevity, presumably the only one on the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area that shows in an older way than 100th Fatulayeva onto a black on white photo.
That here my grandfather is, he became 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years another child testified
However, the sheep herdsman Şirali Müslümov who is supposed to have become 168 years old is a controversial star of the museum.
There is not a birth certificate, however.
And nevertheless faced with the oldest documented human being to become 122 years old Müslümovs old man appears extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years he is supposed to have fathered another daughter.
Did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate therefore with the case of his age around a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max-Planck-institute in Rostock, belonged from the aged ones in Central Asia.
"Becoming noticeable many hochaltrige people gives it also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," Scholz says "also in Sardinia many very old men live extremely".
Because of missing documents no scientific proof is to be led, however, about the age especially as registers of births marriages and deaths were missing.
Every day of cup-wise melted butter
Fact is, however, that the people of the region achieve a biblical age strikingly frequently around Lerik.
At the time of it gives 20 persons that are older than 100 years.
Why live therefore here in the south so much aged?
The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum directress Fatulayeva believes, that it is due to the feeding.
However that the calorie-rich food is just supposed to be so healthy to the Talyschen that meat, bread and particularly milk products love and from which many drink daily a glass of melted butter, does just not seem plausible either from feeding-scientific view.
Or is it the initial way of life which holds the people in a young way? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement close to the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With their 97 years it is still comparably young for these widths.
Mirzayeva who says to have 143 descendants lives in a simple wooden house which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It is on the ground with a churn, that they tireless hin- und her rollt.
Eight people live here under a roof, under that one of Mirzayevas Söhnen and a daughter, both are for a long time grandparents.
Also two small children jump around.
In the kitchen one prepares tea which is served in the typical, stomach-shaped Armadu-glasses for the guests.
Mirzayevas white teeth stand perfectly in Reih and link, under their head scarf she hides long, dark-blond plaits which their son reveals proudly before us.
I always washed my hairs with milk, so I never ran out of them and they kept their color.
"I have also never used shampoo", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension suffices for the life
She always ate only what came from their own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life long I did not buy food an only time in the supermarket.
Then it tells about their husband who was in the army.
It was worst in the time after the Second World War.
Nevertheless everything became better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the oar.
The propaganda rings strangely from the mouth of an old woman.
Nevertheless the cult which is driven around the father figure of the nation which ruled over his country as a dictator does not know hardly borders in Azerbaijan.
To 2003 it was at the power, later his son Ilham took over the oar.
After all there is not any need among Azerbaijan's old people.
230 manats (about instance the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as pension, for local relations an amount which one can live from well.
And maybe also Mirzayevas son for a long time turned gray is right: "The old people enjoy respect in our culture."
You live among the major family, love, worries and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay for so long at the life as possibly
