Szabo: "Germans must play bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote about the photo from Palestine.
Loud Stephen Szabo, expert for Us European Relationships, Berlin in this way balances on a narrow diplomatic degree.
German wave: At the beginning of the week Germany had signaled first of all that it the Palestinian would vote against the request for an observer status near the United Nations.
Then, however, Berlin contained itself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis put into Gaza.
Now Germany must be cautious due to his special relationship with Israel, however.
However, simultaneously I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without being, however, too critically opposite Israel.
During the revolt in Libya in March 2011, when it was a question of fitting out a flight prohibition zone, Germany also abstained.
Finally this was put through by the NATO.
Does Germany fell it heavily to get a clear position with the case of important international topics?
Yes, that is right.
That fits, that his foreign policy just rearranges it and indeed away from a politics that became gemanaged so to speak from the USA there for a German foreign policy.
Complicating comes, that the Europeans do not have any coherent and homogeneous politics.
The Germans find themselves therefore between the fronts against.
One expects of them that they play a more independent role, at that they are not, however, accustomed.
I believe, they still approach their role, but they are on the way for a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Great Britain.
What means a "normal" foreign policy actually from German view?
It shows the willingness to get with the case of national interests also positions which are independent from those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy of the economic policy is motivated therefore from the exports and his relationships to certain regions, about instance Russia, China or the Near East.
Germany's economic interests are different to a certain degree than those of the other great powers are and therefore Germany must protect his interests.
These economic interests had influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand Germany has big markets in the Near east, especially in the Gulf State.
Therefore it must be cautious, the public, but also the elites, not to bump before the head in the Arabian countries.
That plays in any case a role.
But I would not want to attach too much weight to that either, that is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But an important role plays in any case in German considerations.
Germany damaged his relationships with the USA when it abstained with the case of important decisions about instance during the vote above Palestine?
I believe, there is great sense for the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
Therefore I do not believe that this was a so dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Maybe Germany in this way will record even a certain respect.
Because nevertheless it signals that it is taken as international player seriously and his interests must be considered.
There are in Europe different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The USA on the other hand spoke out clearly for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?
Due to the American inside politics these varieties always existed.
I believe that the government has presumably quite a lot of sense for the European position secretly under Obama.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot represent this position publicly of course.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not so great at all as they always appear.
If you have a look at the relationships between Obama and prime minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so hellauf enthusiastic of Netanjahus politics at all then.
Does Germany fell it heavily to arrange his narrow relationships with Israel and the USA on the one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other hand?
I believe, exactly that it does so difficult for the Germans.
It would be natural a little more simply for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European politics which currently is not the case.
Therefore they cannot be a part of a wider line and things must drive forward instead of this out of their own position.
They straighten that with the euro.
I believe, in future Germany will take over a leading role, to insist Europe on a European position.
That is not natural simply for Germany, already because of the relationship to Israel.
That was always already a sensitive topic.
But I believe that it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself even in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to take over a title role anyway?
Or does Germany fell the leading role still heavily?
Germany is not yet used to that, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
If we have a look for example at the euro crisis, there most different anti-German feelings become free each time if Germany accepts a bigger role.
That does simply not do it to the Germans.
That is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is so seen in a much more difficult position as the USA.
It must be prone to most different neighbors and opinions and that is not simple.
Now the influence of the USA takes in the European politics continuously off, the EU does not fill at the moment this vacuum, however, who stays there otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they do not like it, it is it unpleasant to them and it makes it still much more unpopular - c'est la vie!
