Petronella Wyatt: I became from Oxford gemobbt because I am a Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their opinions
Always it had been my greatest dream to receive a place at the Oxford university.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university that I held for the biggest knowledge temple of the world once for a modern Greek symposium, that supported the big columns of the civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks after my entry in the Worscester college end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had packed again my suitcases and caused so the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said I would have gone because I had had a problem in this way that fellow students had sex in the adjacent room.
The author A N Wilson declared mischievously I would have left the university because I was forced to that, to drink from damaged cups.
The truth, however, was less amusing.
I ran away.
Ran, because I suffered from systematic Mobbing and threats.
Not about instance due to my quite unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
One had harassed me only for a reason - a reason, that in this alleged cradle of the illumination the more narrow-minded and crueler shone: My in the meantime late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important consultant Margaret Thatchers and I proponent of the Conservative Party.
Why mentions I this just now?
Now, according to current reports a new generation of students of the moderate ones suffers Dispute under similar pursuit.
The organized and increasing hatred for Tory students in Oxford developed in the meantime such dimensions that a group demanded the same equal rights protection from them last week the gays', disabled persons and ethnic minorities benefits.
Conservative members of the junior Common Room (JCR) the corpus Christi College serve, they are "often isolated due to their political opinions actively ", personally attacked and declared as unwanted".
You demand a place in the equal rights committee of their college in order to guarantee that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation through a recently broadcast documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland", was Verschlimmert: Young, Bright and on the Right" that represented Tories as Exzentriker and neo-Nazis.
In that graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative studentischen union of the Oxford university, who went in a Rolls-Royce and showed off with silvery suit and silver-busy going-stick was shown among other things.
At other universities conservative students say they are considered as "Scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year long hatch Black, vice-president of the conservative student union of the Nottingham university, made in a Sunday newspaper be reported: "There is a wachsende link tendency at universities.
The people believe, we are as the Bullingdon Club without having become acquainted with us anyway".
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in corpus Christi that initiated the request for bigger protection thinks such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative studentischen union of Oxford says, she observed a wachsende refusal with JCR members opposite students of the moderate ones Dispute.
"This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the good health of the members" she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford I belonged to such a minority.
When incredibly shy 18-year I was arrived in September 1986.
The Hatred for the Conservative Party had reached his climax.
In the previous year the university had voted for not giving Margaret Thatcher - a former student - any honorary title due to shortenings in the college being.
The atmosphere would have made even Stalinists be startled.
In the first days of the Erstsemester-week at which new students become acquainted with themselves and the tutors I received a foretaste of the future events.
I had the experience, that the tutors did only not tolerate the mocking of Tory students, but participated in that even with joys.
Political topics as the miner strike, the denationalization and the refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid-regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events I should translate French texts from the 18th century in the English. Onto what then should come, I had not been grabbed.
"Miss "you translate the first sale" to Wyatt", the tutor Harry Pitt (in the meantime late) said, "please".
I stumbled in this case.
Pitt was a small man with a face as from cake mixture, and quite spiteful.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or they are only simple stupid"? he asked to me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes tears boiled up.
"I suggest that they take in your leisure time of a few French hours - therefore if you are" not "occupied with your social activities too very much" Pitt growled at me.
I returned with hanging head to my room.
At this evening I had the supper in the college alone, than me easily for somebody onto the shoulder bet.
An English student was from the second year by the name of James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative studentischen union.
"I know who you are", he said in a friendly manner.
Unfortunately it is how it is.
To be to everyone that is suspected Tory is bullied.
For me it is already bad enough, but she will know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, therefore it will be worse for you.
Most Tory-Erstsemester pretend to be supporters of the Labour-party.
In a local pub I attempted later to act.
I insisted, that I not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion was.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
An university entrant in the compartment of philosophy, politics and economy, that ironischerweise that than conservatively valid Eton College had visited, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You dirtied.
Other students divided his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"As Tories have sex"? one asked to me.
Those ones beat themselves mutually, or?
I felt like this as homosexuals had to have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in leading a normal life at the Oxford university?
Could I meet like-minded persons only after dark?
Should I to turn to the Labour-party and to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years which lay before me stretched themselves before my intellectual eye for a purgatory of the ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who gave to recognize oneself as a Tory openly was Norman Stone, professor, for contemporary history which had his seat in my college.
It was not hated only for being a conservative but also, because he had advised Thatcher as regards foreign policy and written speeches for them.
It was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-check and refused it for his Marxist-deterministic history perspective.
In 1997 he picked up a professorship at the university Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not become happy here", he said to me.
I began, to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and refuge found with friends opened up and member of the family in the city.
I told my father, that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
It seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the forties all political opinions were accepted.
"But it is the best place on the world", he said subduedly.
They would never do something like that, not in my city of the dreaming steeples.
Even my communist friends put always flawless manners on the day.
His moist eyes obscured.
Give a chance to the whole.
I am secure, one only teases you.
It would break me the heart if you went.
My emotional resistance was exhausted by my frequent journeys to London more weakly.
One of my masculine friends, also Tory-Anh√§nger, had given in to the pressure and renounced from his convictions.
During a tutorial in the following week with the case of which a further history tutor had said seriously I am "an enemy of the nation" I decided on doing the same one.
In spite of my overcoming with shame secretly, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwashing", and she named "old idiots".
The relief lasted only shortly.
It was my father who beat the last nail into the coffin of my Oxford-career.
At that time he wrote weekly two columns in the Murdoch-press.
My door was shut.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bloodhounds gave up.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Gladly you can mention me a tearful wimp.
But none 18-year should have to suffer ever from such intimidation and evil-mindedness in an educational facility institution.
And it is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that did not produce only 14 Tory prime ministers, but hides until today behind an undeserved call of equal rights and freedom of thought.
