In spite of the "imminent fall" the students must study, create projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State the final examination is carried out at the eve of the apocalypse, for which the students do not have any other chance than "to weiterarbeiten up to the night, where the world supposedly draws to a close", said restable.

"The prophecy of the Mayas handled our first project, and in certain way we discredit her", said Julie Zeglen, student in the last year in Temple, in a 21 years old way and from west Cheshire.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is a question only of a key point in the calendar, said restable.
