Birth in the cosmos
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board work themselves onto the search for a replacement planet.
In order to save the mankind, the important question how we can propagate in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet surrenders?
There are not many choices in my opinion.
De facto there are only two real planets which we could inhabit at least hypothetically.
"Indeed Mars and Venus", the scientific employee of the Astronomical Sternberg-Instituts Wladimir Surdin says.
There is a temperature of 500 degrees, while, however, the conditions are being comparably life-friendly on the Mars, on the surface of the Venus.
Life would be only in big height or in the orbit of the Venus, therefore in the space, possible.
The researchers handled the question of the propagation in the space first of all with regard to the flora.
Already half a century in front of that experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas cultivated in the orbit did in the least not distinguish from the earthly kinds.
It the growing followed from insects, more exact of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In the year 1979 Wachteleier were sent to the cosmos in order to investigate how the weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
A very normal chicken develops.
However, then the problem begins.
"The problem consists in the chicken having to find Halt; it must be able to stand on his legs and start moving", explains the lab conductor of the institute for medical-biological problems AT THAT, Wladimir Sychew.
Without fixed subsoil the chickens somersaulted wildly.
Ten hours later the instincts of the newborns were completely dulled.
The chickens did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later they simply died then.
"Twice we made chickens slip and stopped the whole then because it is simply impossible to work there with them" observes Wladimir Sychew for the failed experiment with the chickens in the space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring 2013 the experiments are continued.
However, there will be only homosexual species on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats, which already inseminates into the space were sent.
In principle nothing special was arrested in this case.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but only a single experiment was renewed it, and the investigations must be continued", notices Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing the space rats got junior staff.
One could not solve the problems natures of the propagation directly in the space up to now.
The task is difficult.
Animals which are torn from their natural living space can simply not follow their propagation urge.
Unlike animals can the human being that fundamental.
The homo sapiens is capable to abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
Nevertheless be flying to women already for 50 years into the space.
There was the greatest risk at Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing to have the mankind is the feminine organism.
Our seagull flew from that, and nobody on the earth could have answered following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally nobody answered this question", says space travel veteran Wachtang to Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after their space flight, the first feminine cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also a cosmonaut.
In the year 1988 the second woman gave birth to a son in the space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who twice was in the orbit and performed even works outside of the spacecraft.
In spite of that a risk remains.
We have only extremely few cosmonauts with whom after long flights everything went well and they got healthy junior staff.
"Per more, it is the more dangerous even in the case of flights to the orbit", cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation, concludes.
And nevertheless the mankind must search for new ways in the biotechnology, the radiation protection and the producing of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a compulsory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a suspense state the cosmonauts gain routine for the work in the open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is some foreign surroundings; however, babies feel water as a natural element.
It is, as the Ichtyander small ones would lay down report of that that the life at the country the ocean entstieg.
It gives a connection between the fact that there is a child about 9 months in the stomach of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that that it can become accustomed to water more easily then.
Basically that is logical since from the birth up to the first swimming 2 weeks just go by once.
"That is too little time in order to forget something", says baby swimming-teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While therefore for a newborn child the weightlessness is being a much more natural state, the woman does not manage without force of gravity.
In a state of the weightlessness the stomach and basin musculature forms itself enormously quickly back and it takes away also the ability in this way to squeeze out the child.
Na good, we avoid that through geburtseinleitende aids.
The birth could occur for example also in a special chamber in order to squeeze out the child.
"Aber what happens then"? the question of Waleri Poljakow not insignificant says.
On the other hand the child needs also artificial force of gravity.
Without feeling the earth attraction, the organism cannot shape the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in the orbit into a load suit as an adult for the training.
It will lack what is for his life of elementary importance simple.
"This experiment that we carry out together, that is the birth of a child in some foreign surroundings, will provide, that we will bring a disabled person," a completely unangepassten human being to the world", the conductor says ahead of the bioethics commission of the institute for medical-biological problems AT THAT, Igor Pestow.
Up to now the birth of children is bare theory in the cosmos.
Sometime she becomes, however, reality if the earthlings open to a far planet in their spaceships that that home for their descendants born in the space becomes.
