Guidelines for the inflation of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The servers' www.bankovnipoplatky.com who pages an inquiry annually about the most absurd bank fees decided this year on organizing the competition "Most absurd regulation and/or idea from the EU workshop".
"The plan recently proposed by the EU to introduce a woman rate from 40% in the management of big European companies brought us to this idea", said Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organization of this inquiry, opposite the newspaper Právo.
Under the nominated absurdities the judgment of the European court of justice is found for example about the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then women enjoyed with the case of life assurances an advantage because they represent a smaller risk objectively for the assurance companies companies.
"Wider incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated until end of this year.
The actual vote occurs then until end February 2013", Nacher informed.
For the controversial EU regulations the obligatory addition of bio-ethanol belongs among other things to fuels, that is in their consequence nature-damaging, furthermore the prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometers, only because these contain a relatively small amount of this danger material, or also the guideline to the size of chicken cages, because of which became this year of eggs considerably more expensive.
Criticism received in the past also the actual prohibition of the use of the concept "butter spread" or also the sale prohibition for traditional electric bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry whose demands are represented by a or several member countries in Brussels normally (so Czechia attempts currently for example to put through the demands of Czech banks also with veto-threat).
Lobby-interests also supported that bananas of the highest grade must be at least 14 cm long in the EU and must not show any "curve anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself in this case with the argument that it harmonizes only the uneven single state norms which would hinder the trade.
The norms concerning fruit and vegetable were already softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the tip, that the previous guidelines would lead to a wastage from food.
A candidate for the victory in this inquiry is possibly the EU regulation of the last year that the tip must be equipped with according to balloons with the case of the sale that children must not blow up the balloon under eight years without supervision of an adult.
The EU referred in this case to an American study according to which balloons are the leading cause during the death from suffocation of children.
A similar restriction is valid already for children to 14 years during the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are strange ideas also at home
Also a guideline that affects the European officials themselves is relatively absurd - everyone that takes an official function in the EU must not use the denomination Macedonia for Greece because of the sensitivity of the topic and must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead of this.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in collaboration Laissez Faire with the association of liberal economists next to the o.g. absurdities also the EU regulation of the extent of food inventory on the field of a member country.
The EU defined in this way the Höchstvolumen at food inventory which was allowed to be found at the day of our EU entry on the field of the Czech Republic.
Czechia exceeded then e.g. the defined volume for mushroom canned food for which a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the inquiry were also from the idea impressed or, however, of the idea to give supporting-money for requests for supporting-money.
These ideas came certainly not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are put at a disadvantage by our not having any sea.
We will "apply" near the EU for restitution", declared in the fall the former agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in 2004.
As an argument he mentioned that the grain harvest was very high and the state warehouses were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases.
Since Czechia has a further way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us according to Palas.
Finally The European Commission complied with Czechia so far that she organized an announcement to countries which do not have any access to the sea about the purchase from grain.
The ministry offered supporting-money for requests for supporting-money to the municipalities for regional development under the orders of minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), actually it should be a question in this case of means for the Aufsetzung of supporting money requests at Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations become in the member countries the target of the criticism which earns efforts of the EU around regulation and in this way also around effectiveness and development of the entire European Union in opinion of some experts, however, rather of recognition easily indeed.
The EU supporting-money is rather a more serious problem in opinion of these experts for projects which do not have anything with the deepening of the European integration together at all in that, which, however, were forced by single member countries at the budget negotiations.
Also the fact that Czechia must fight for the right to use of specific denominations of traditional products similar to other member countries in Brussels and does always not gain this fight in this case causes emotions in these parts.
Czechia could defend the denomination "Olomoucké tvarůžky" indeed after a six year long fight with Germany and Austria, our manufacturers had to rename the Inländerrum (Tuzemský for that) whose tradition goes back with us until the 19th century in "Tuzemák", however.
The Denomination For that may be used only for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beets.
In the official list of the products registered in the EU dive in the society of the world-famous cheese sorts Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker marzipan's or the Parma ham's now also the Karlsbader rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer hop on.
With a EU brand can boast there the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer roles.
