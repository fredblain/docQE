The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson aroused in the last summer a certain sensation, and this for good reason.
One believes in fact, that this boson at nothing less than participated in the mechanism is that is responsible for the measures of all objects in the universe.
And finally it is a question of the last corpuscle whose existence was observed from the standard model - our best or "least wrong" declaration of the nature and the behavior of the matter - predictedly, but empirically not yet.
But for the physicists it is not completely secure that it is really a question of the Higgs yet.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new corpuscle, and that it resembles the Higgs-boson predicted from the standard model strongly.
In addition this seems to be confirmed by new data which were presented in this week on a great physics-congress in Kyoto, but data are missing still in order to be completely secure about that.
We assume in spite of that deceiving oneself it being a question of the Higgs in fact since apparently only a small risk exists, and we have a look at what it is a question of.
There is in this world an unavoidably unavoidable law which causes that two objects cannot be available simultaneously at the same place.
It is not possible to offend against this rule - and you do not attempt it too strongly since you will hurt.
Because even if the corpuscle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that also such a law applies to them: the Pauli'sche exclusion principle that says that two corpuscles cannot fill the same room at the same time, when they are in the same "quantum state", at which this "state" on the whole consists of some of their properties.
Of that going out the physicists split up the corpuscles in two categories one.
The good citizens who are called Fermione and in a well-behaved way obey to the Pauli exclusion principle are in a corner.
And in the other one those ones move bosons, a bad gang of anarchists to whom nothing is holy - in any case not this principle, what means that they can be in the action at the same time at the same place.
These bosons divide according to himself the web page The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboren (that is after all the way completely amazing) in two groups on: the Mesonen, which we will not handle here and the "strength corpuscles", through which the great strengths of the nature spread and with those ones the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be accentuated here, however, that these bosons not all so exotic creatures are, as one could mean.
If you are in the situation to read this chronicle then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "photon" which the "messenger" of the electro-magnetic strength is.
If indeed a corpuscle with an electrical load speeds up or changes the direction, the electro-magnetic field "is faulty" exactly at this place, in about instance as a pebble that was flung into a pond.
An electro-magnetic wave (Light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation and so forth) arises through this "trouble", and this wave is not anything else than a photon and thus one thing that one bosons "Carrier of the strength".
More stable field
Same is valid for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must "be interrupted" so that this shows itself boson.
However, the Higgs-field is very much more stable than the electro-magnetic field is; the exciter must achieve very high energies, a little bit comparable with a pond been cold whose surface could be zerfurcht only from a very big rock.
Therefore a gigantic particle accelerator as the CERN is necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with an extent of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electro-magnetic field is once again helpful in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are not in fact all corpuscles and not all materials that interact with the electro-magnetic field.
Some, as magnets, do this, however other not - for example a leaf would never by itself keep paper to the refrigerator.
And equally do not interact all corpuscles with the Higgs field: those ones who do it own a mass while the others are not owning (as after all the way the photon) any measures.
For what can all these investigations be now "good", asks Ms Plamondon?
They serve the inspection of the standard model (SM) for the science, and they also make for the physicists possible, all deviations between the observations and the forecasts of the to examine SM exactly.
There are after all the way numerous physicists who hope most ardently for such deviations being found since the least difference could open a door for a "new physics" and darn some holes of the model.
One must say that latter still shows great shortcomings there it no declaration for the force of gravity (ups!) and the dark matter offers that forms approx. 80% of the matter of the universe (once again ups!).
However, such deviations were not found at the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these investigations for the general population are to be predicted in a more difficult way, but it would be to be accepted wrongly that there were not any.
After all the way: in the early sixties the engineers of the laser did not presume that their works would activate such a revolution in the barking-labs.
You saw scientific applications, however nothing else wider.
In fact the late physicist Willard Boyle - that worked in the Bell Labs in whom the laser was invented in the 1960th years, and developed that one the first continuous wave laser (the first were pulsated) in 1962 even - said already to us that the laser at the beginning was rather regarded as a "lab game".
Introduce yourself...
In addition applications can result also from all the instruments which surround the research.
For example Willard Boyle developed in turn a small light sensor in 1969 during his works in the optics.
Although it was not the initial purpose, this sensor is used today as "an eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and brought in the Nobel prize for him in 2009 for physics.
Of course this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our life unavoidably, but it means that one can never really know it...
