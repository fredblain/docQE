Poles and the space.
Polen was picked up last week on a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European protection switching request space organization as a twentieth member of this space authority. Polen is in this way the second member country from the former East bloc (to Czechia, which became protection switching request member on 12th November 2008).
Poland began in the year 1994 a narrow cooperation with the protection switching request and participated in the following years in several protection switching request projects.
The way of Poland into the space began certainly much formerly.
Already before the Second World War occupied Polish cosmos-enthusiastic with the space travel in the case of which they did always not find sense in this way.
I remind here for example of the lecture of A. Šternfeld of the 6th December 1933 in the Warschauer observatory near which the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Entry for the cosmonautics".
The listeners let the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905), however, coldly, and after years Šternfeld still remembered, that only Dr. Jan Gadomski Interesse had shown at his work.
Šternfeld won in the year 1934 for "Entry for the cosmonautics" the Prix REPPING-stag donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) an important advocate of the astronomy and the space travel became later.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books for these scientific disciplines.
Contribution worldwide acknowledged of Gadomskis to the development of the space travel was acknowledged among other things through one of the craters being named after it on the earth-averted page of the moon.
Already in the year 1925 a railroad hand trolley for which a rocket propulsion was planned was built in poles.
The author of the draft and the details of this intention remained unfortunately unknown.
It is not even clarified yet whether the missile should be used for the starting or for the braking of the hand trolley.
The information on that come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In the year 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-practiced projectiles.
The institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia led the studies in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents handed down it is clear that the research had advanced until the stage of practical tests.
The research was suspended then by the marching in of the German Wehrmacht certainly.
In the year 1937 the draft of a photoelectric hunt missile coming from Ing. Rohoziński emerged in the trade press, and in the following year the work "Rakieta" appeared "- torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war all projects for the military use of the rocketry were coordinated by the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two-year activity his work was ended, however, from the outbreak of war.
Further articles for the space travel were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space travel society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society occurs in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy in which four extensive articles are dedicated to the space travel.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the foundation of a space travel society.
At the time there were already the first projects for the satellite technique, and it was to be foreseen that the exploration of the space would have future.
Already in their beginnings in the year 1956 the Polish Space Travel Society PTA made an effort for an entry to the Internationalen confederation founded in 1951 for space travel, and in fact the PTA became already in the fall tidy member in 1956.
In the following year the first PTA chairperson became, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairpersons' of the International Confederation for space travel.
He held this office up to his death in the year 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA participated in a leading way in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for the scientific research.
The first type, that RM-1, was finished in the year 1957, the first start occurred on 10th October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did completely not weigh 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 RM-2 began in the Błędów-desert flight tests with the two-stage rocket.
The missile was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should be already to achieve real scientific work in the situation - the missile RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of height winds.
In the year 1962, however, the further development was stopped.
The Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years 1962 to 1965 became successor of the first missiles of the type RM.
The missile was designed as a two-stage rocket, their overall length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed by this missile (Meteor-1A -1 bar and -1 C), that distinguished in the size of the transportation room from each other for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transportation room with 0.4 liters of capacity, Meteor-1B above 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C above 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude was with all three types 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 the Meteor-2-Rakete whose first flight tests began in October 1970 was developed in the aviation institute.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was in the situation to carry a working load of 10 kg to a height from about 60 km.
After that the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Also the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 which two years later the foundation of a national cosaving-committee followed in is Erwähnenswert.
Polen participated itself also in the astrionics with Soviet satellites within the framework of the intercosmos-program, and in the year 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
