"Valentino draws elegance of the celebrity before"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of the couture" that was opened this week in London, ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker speaks.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the single place in the British capital which is worthy of the Beherbergung of an exhibition above Valentino Garavani.
The designer during the opening of "Valentino" has this "-" acknowledged "of master of the couture", an overwhelming retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute couture were put together that were created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a history whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani which, however, could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino verspürte always already fascination for the stuffy and far world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition that will be to be seen still up to the 3rd March there is a great number at private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, begun by the princess Salimah Aga khan, about the princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England up to lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise of the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
To be amorous into the nobility does not have to be from disadvantage.
"At least they do not stamp out their edges on your marvellous carpet as it some beautiful celebrities put from the pop music", says baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60th and 70th years the two lived in the alps and good friends were.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all were pleased if we were invited to his house in Gstaad", the exwoman of "Heini" Thyssen declares, in a close way with forgotten beauties as to B. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino preferred always already the elegance of the celebrity.
And nevertheless he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went into Rome to it home for the supper according to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna.
We were about 20 persons, under that also Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Recognized by every detail of his apartment, the decoration, at the food and at the music and one sensed his influence.
"All invited felt important and loved", the "top model" remembers that began their career at the week of the Haute couture in 1995 in Paris.
"It never comes from the fashion, because his designs works of art are" she says definitively..
Fashion show of the origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of keenness, rather of mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was changed into a catwalk glorious and 60 meters long which suggests a role exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk in order to admire a marvellous "audience" that takes masterpieces from Valentino how for example the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for their wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti bore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather belonged, the the empress Farah Diba.
In this public from dummies names as that one shine from Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Saying a lot of of these customers which is first Valentino as the first love, "unforgettable".
I can remember still perfectly.
It was some trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a present of it", says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I would accuse him of all other because of his great love for the women and because he emphasizes our beauty, before" the ex-duchess matches from Feria.
I like the colors which he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The first time cannot forget also the princess and opinion guide with the case of the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg when it supported a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed about having the age and the occasion to bear one of his evening dresses at last...
Finally at the end of the nineties it was added then.
I bought my first Valentino dress for myself for a celebration in the castle of my cousin, that prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped upper part with a neckline which does honor to his name.
"It was a truly become dream", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless", this Italian aristocrat that lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires explains.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps their evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress but also the memories combined with that".
The "king" of the fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for their wedding with Pablo de Grecia in the year 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker mentioned his sewers) were necessary in order to make this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a tail four and a half meters long.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the uppermost authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the uppermost society".
For years with that "savoir-être" obscured to the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l 'Orders the Arts et of the Lettres, marked with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors, as each of the husbands of his customers.
"His well-kept and perfect outside appearance struck me always his cunning, his rest," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw it the last time a month ago at a gala dress supper in the museum de Orsay.
He was at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"It was immaculate; the time does not leave behind any tracks at it".
And a princess says this...
