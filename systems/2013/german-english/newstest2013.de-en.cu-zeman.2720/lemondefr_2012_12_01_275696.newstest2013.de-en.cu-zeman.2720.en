With Bitcoin is possible without pay and selling bank
The reverse of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and administrative fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies to a political vision tangible: the belief that the current Bankmonopolen shaped monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin, a virtual currency (but in dollar, euro convertible, etc.), as well as a record for the secure exchange of such as BitTorrent, the peer-to-peer file.
With 15,000 computers in the network have already been some 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand websites than accept Bitcoin donations or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, a peak of 30 euros ($23), had succeeded, it had fallen five months later, at $2, before today to around $10 has recovered (the courses are on the website listed bitcoincharts. com).
Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the real world trade currencies or financial products.
However the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies shown interest for this.
It describes as “the Bitcoin virtual currency with the greatest success,” “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to the traditional currencies.”
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that will be used to make progress in a video game, which is winning games, or buy (and sometimes zurücktauschen).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, each time the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin, all at the same time, Rechnungsbuchs Netzknoten repositories of the auditors, money-issuers and buyers and sellers.
Where is this network?
Each transaction between two users place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the users pay for each other to be able to choose what the anonymity.
A number of the associated with this transaction data electronically through a double cypher system signed.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the volume of Bitcoins in the whole network Rechnungsbuch widespread public accounts are available.
The crucial step is to ensure that these new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task on computers will be launched, with the winner, a kind of temporary Zentralbankier is the privilege has the additional line added.
It is a carving up the file, i. e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprints.
The computer “take” the new transaction and do a number, before the whole “chopped up, covered in quicklime.”
The aim is to be number one, to find a special fingerprint (many zeros at the start).
If this figure was found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is in the long term with the chain of all other transactions linked, and any modification of the fingerprint would change.
If a user to Betrügen twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money will pay, was only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains without a link, because they both have different fingerprints.
The computer, which the task, receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will reward this regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins are in circulation, bringing to 21 million, but limited to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, which leaves some room …
In addition, the difficulty of the task, with any improvement in as much computing power as increased.
The lives of the network has had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, have been attacked and the Bitcoin-deposits stolen.
“The used weakness concerns not the underlying protocol,” assured Pierre Noizat just Paymium has introduced, a company to pay with real money is and the network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the potential of the anonymous money laundering through this service.
However, cash also these shortcomings.
Major players, such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blog platform WordPress will accept them.
Recently, FDI Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel the Rechnungsbuch analysed and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins will not be in circulation.
In November, a “mega-Schlussverkauf”.
“Dreißigtausend dollars have been exchanged,” Holmquist, Jon is happy for the company, which operates Coinabul Bitcoins convertible into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on this currency is, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk.
His system Paytunia corresponds with a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but using Bitcoin validation of the transactions that it is cheaper.
In addition, managed the holders of its identity and, therefore, can remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented the traders, and the latter have no new terminals or install programs.
They simply need to give an address, a phone “photographed and identified,” Pierre Noizat is the assurance that it has thousands of users.
It is a general trend seen in the hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally oriented systems should be rethought.
“It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, the different today, as a highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency to reassess.
