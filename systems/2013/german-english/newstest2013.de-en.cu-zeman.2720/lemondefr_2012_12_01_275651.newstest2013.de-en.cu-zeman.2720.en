“PSG is not the FC Barcelona!”
In this season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How would you explain this progress?
You can make it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players are.
Every day I am making progress on its side.
Technical staff has given me too much.
These elements will spur me on to my Spielniveau every day to improve.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football everything is very quickly.
But I will not stop in excitement.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training the INF Clairefontaine until my Spielzeit in Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
You are thus by Carlo Ancelotti introduced competition advantage …
The new entrants this summer are accustomed to games very high level.
You also know that any Trainingseinheit is crucial.
This means that, as a player, I have to stand up to and doing his best wishes.
Incidentally, it gives me a lot of Carlo Ancelotti in relation to my Spielposition.
He is co-coaches as Claude Makelele, helped in the same position as I played.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect all technicians.
In the Ligue 1, at the moment, there is no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a rich experience and has many title with prestigious clubs won.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I was a Verletzungsserie recovers.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation of my services.
What are your thoughts on the first part of the season, the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of us Spitzenreiters.
But we lie in wait.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League, we have in this way for the final 8 qualified.
What is the objective of the club in this competition.
We will try, as much as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we are against very good teams our input.
First of all, we want to lead our group in Porto, so that we have the return leg of the Achtelfinales Heimspiel as possible.
Can the PSG in the short term, a major european club?
He has already had its budget …
A major european club, Paris title to win and in the long term a name.
That is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG the resources so that this project is taking shape.
It would be a big failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to win, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really at the heart of this title, cream off.
Last season we were sealed off.
In May, we were disappointed because we have been strong enough for the victory.
We have the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points …
But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this is the right thing to do.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux in the title fight, I believe that we have the tools to win.
Do you think that the media is too much to expect from PSG?
In the light of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
We accept that entirely.
However, when we are in a Heimspiel against Troyes 4-0 win, and we still find something we can reproach, is a little frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to establish a Spielkonzept.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for the last two seasons, for the final 8 to qualify, and also the huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed on your time out with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the french championship ignored.
Lyon and Marseille in the last season were not good, this new “PSG geboostet.”
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that, in the month of May, the winner will be smiling and tell us that, despite the difficulties, we won.
The PSG seems full of performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to depend.
All the better, to be a “Zlatan-dependency.
This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and scoring many goals.
That is why he came, and he shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he's a great player and a world star with respect.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respected the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is exceptional.
This encourages others to her Spielniveau to improve.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world is, it allows all other also to make progress.
How have you Euro 2012 with the french national team experience?
As a disappointment.
I was anxious to take part in this match.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented something Spielzeit party.
I have seen things, from which I am stronger.
Today, I find it good games in the national team.
That was my baptism with the “Bleus” my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learnt our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behavior.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps, at the top of the “Bleus”?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.
The coach is strictly, is close to the players and to the victory.
As Laurent Blanc.
But I would not want to see a comparison.
Blanc had achieved its objective, we had qualified for the championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps, the “Bleus” will lead to Brazil.
Put on October 16 in Spain forced draw (1: 1) a Auftaktspiel?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has been for everyone else.
Before the meeting in Spain, I have never had a similar game in my career.
