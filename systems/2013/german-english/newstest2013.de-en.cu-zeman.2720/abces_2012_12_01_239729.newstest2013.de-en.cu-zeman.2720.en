This exhibition is the conclusion of a story, the sole protagonist in “Il” Signore Garavani, but without his distinguierte clientele would be written.
Valentino had always been stickige and fascination for the distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which will continue until March 3 to see, there is a wide range of private letters and photos with the signature of the erlesensten aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social advancement in the city by the modest Modemacher Voghera in northern Italy for the International Jetsets idol.
