The film Argo: if it's the worst that Hollywood call
In November 1979 occupied a mob of islamist students who demonstrated the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they were asking for the extradition of ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had fled the absence on his regime intact.
For the american government there was no good way out of this situation-they could not afford, the Shah to cast aside, as this is the confidence of their allies in other countries have been heavily damaged.
At the same time, she was not in a position, in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime led to the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent disaster at the violent attempt to retrieve made it even worse.
The diplomats were finally captured after 444 days released after negotiations mediated by the algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the presidential election against Ronald Reagan in 1980.
The film Argo, directed by Ben Affleck and actor describes an episode in the history of the United States, a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message has six Botschaftsmitarbeitern flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the canadian ambassador.
The CIA managed in cooperation with the canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; helping them a flamboyant Verdeckung story to its true identity-they travelled with canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, supposedly in the country Drehorte for a science-fiction movie.
The combination of genres
The experts on “Exfiltration”, Tony Mendez, developed the plan also made Hollywood's cooperation is needed.
The cover was credible, article on this film in journals, press conferences have been held and the fictitious Produktionsgesellschaft had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret; the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic Politthriller, but at the same time, a so-called “Caper Movie,” i. e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks as, for example, the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film the Stimmungsebenen-on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen (from Tehran in the Titelsequenz ikonische contemporary photographs to be shown, and also in the same Filmfassung situations, there are no major differences).
On the other side of the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and therefore easily taken to its extreme.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA and other key institutions-men in suits on Besprechungstisch, Amtsfluren, on the phone …
Ben Affleck with this remarkable film is a relaunch of his career.
From a belächelten actor is a director of respectable, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third movie after the whodunit not easy Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller of the city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film Afflecks, not in their local Boston plays the film-maker.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films by the director of the standard Hollywood.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada “played”.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place-the Eingangssequenz the storming of the embassy is in its simplicity and gives it very impressive, yet the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictability, if that happens, their history.
A similar effect, Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong Filmstab at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to face up to the fact that history is not, in fact, many in the cinematographic sense exciting scenes.
With the little but he works quite well, with the reality he sometimes nachhilft-then what is not always so elegantly works (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone call in America is avoided, or the chase on the runway, something curious).
The weakness of Argo is its all too broad distribution, which is caused by the need to act, too much in too many places to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, in their roles as Hollywood staff is very charming, their characters but would have more space, and in the film, they are far from alone.
Afflecks film by losing traction. it is a movie, the one with some interest, and the design and the to a thriller from the 70 years-like style goutieren angle.
Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult.
As a reminder of a date in some way of living history, and as evidence of how excessive but the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, however, he is sufficient.
