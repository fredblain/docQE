The proposal, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes to the Arms Act shortly will be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the russian authorities of the problems with “attraction of the screws” trying to fight.
On the Internet, published an open letter, the author-representatives of various Waffenverbände-demand that the authorities of “futile” clamps to refrain.
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian Service of the BBC.

The first channel is the army or the military, i. e., the weapons during the fighting in the Caucasus have been stolen.

The second channel is illegal weapons, the vigilante of criminals are stolen.
Baranez explained that these weapons count, both from the armouries police and staff directly from the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.
Further illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals.
Many Militärlagern came to explosions.
“There is evidence that some cases of arson, the lack of weapons to cover up,” says the former military personnel.
A contribution to the black market in accordance with Baranez also make the arms manufacturers.
“Nowadays there are countless private Rüstungsfabriken, the international competition and therefore does not meet the weapons under the hands on the black market, some in Moscow to dump,” reported the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a distinct, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a mafia, the smuggling organization,” explained the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated what percentage of each of the five channels in the supplying of black market with illegal arms around.

Half of all the weapons on the black market are going through “the blame from those who, in their work with weapons have reached,” the report states.
The data, according to the researchers from 17% of the weapons from conflict zones, 14% of theft in the arms industry, and 5% comes from illegal excavation.
A Verkaufsberater Waffenladens one, which did not name who wants to be assured that weapons from illegal excavation to be found, for a long time, no one is buying, as they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more likely that retailers are the supply routes in a weapons cache.
