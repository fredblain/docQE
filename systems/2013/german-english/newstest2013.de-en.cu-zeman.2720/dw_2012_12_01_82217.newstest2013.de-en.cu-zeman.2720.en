Szabo: “Germans have greater role”
Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine to abstain from the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on us-european relations, so that Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations would vote in favour.
But then abstained from Berlin.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, but be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it is not of the american position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, the NATO force.
It is difficult to Germany on important international issues a clear position on this issue?
Yes, it's true.
This is because it is his foreign policy and shifting away from a policy, as it were, from the US gemanaged was, to a german foreign policy.
This is compounded by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are so between the fronts.
We expect them to play an independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think they abuse are still on their role, but they are on the path to a more “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as France or Britain.
What is a “normal” foreign policy, what specifically from a german point of view?
It shows the willingness to national interests to take positions that are independent from those of the US or european partners.
I believe that the german foreign policy from the economic policy is motivated, so exports and its relationship to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and why Germany must protect its interests.
They have economic interests influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
That is why it must be careful to the public, but also the elite in the arab countries not to offend the.
This is definitely a role.
But I would also not want too much weight, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it is definitely an important role in german thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the US, taking on major decisions abstained from the vote, for example, in the vote on Palestine?
I think, in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the german position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this is such a dramatic break was, as in the libyan issue.
Maybe Germany so that even a certain respect einspielen.
But because it signals that it as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions to the palestinian initiative.
The United States have been clear for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the US and many european nations?
Because of the american domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly pretty much sympathy for the european position.
But because of the political situation here, the government can this position publicly, of course, are not represented.
I believe that the real differences are not so great, as they always seem to.
If you look at the relationship between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, this is not so, Obama, possibly by Netanyahu's policies.
It is difficult to Germany, his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified european policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a broader approach and instead must things from their own position.
That they do, just with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role in Europe, a european position.
This is, of course, not just for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they are a more independent role to play.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international players-Germany wants to play an active role at all?
Or is the lead Germany still difficult?
Germany is not yet accustomed, it still is unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is the country remains difficult, a greater role to play.
If, for example, we look at the euro crisis, as will each time Germany a greater role, various anti-german feelings freely.
It is not simply the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in european policy, the EU steadily filling the vacuum at the moment but not who remains otherwise?
The Germans will simply need to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like, it is not nice and it is much less popular, c'est la vie!
