The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
In the last week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work.
This decision has called on the public to a lively discussion.
It is interesting that the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world, was based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free movement of capital, complete with rampant speculation go hand-in-hand.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (salaries) are Preisspannungen.
This term is a condition to understand, in which the manufacturers tried to import cheap goods by economic competition, by the competition of “undercutting”, in order to create more of a market share grab and its profit margin.
The large-scale means that for most companies, their production abroad to relocate or buy cheaply, or their business, the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
As the private sector no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for that it caused unemployment to increase the spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and they caused by the wider economic and social damage to replace.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics here are superfluous.
The reckless practices of the private sector creates a situation in the individual economies, where governments are forced to compete with each other to make the social standards of its own population to artificially lower and thus to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private sector.
This manifests itself in particular changes in existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to its own people and to force the dictates of the private sector, in particular in terms of accepting.
This is done by financial constraints with long-term unemployment, on the other, by reducing workers' rights.
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there has, for a number of years, public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the wake of increasing the competitiveness of german economy, it regularly to cases in which employees received such a poor reward for the state to increase their income subsistence needs.
Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employed workers discovered.
The austerity measures, virtually all the EU's southern states will, no doubt, in the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century was the case), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society and to hope that, at some point, private capital will flow into the country.
Here is, by its very nature, the question of where this capital is coming?
If it is from another EU country, only the poverty is moving from one country to another; or the capital remains the same from, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the salaries.
This applies across Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam, that the state is not with capital in its own economy involved, and that planning for economic calamity.
The private sector will narrow insists on its position that the state not to intervene directly in the economy.
But then we have to ask if the private sector the policy and therefore the whole state in their own selfish sense influenced or even draws.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and all-pervasive in all states lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of the corruption, the mutual benefit, the legislation, in the virtually everything, but nothing is criminally punishable.
In Germany, the reality is that a lack of finances private Staatsministerium crowded, with the industry Rechtsunternehmen interdependent with the drafting of legislative proposals.
These are then adopted draft legislation in the Bundestag.
The violence is not from the people, as western constitutions, but by large financial groups, which have their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly in a situation like the Appian in his work on the crisis at the time of the Roman Republic and Pompey Caesar” describes: “the state has long been the break-up, and the offices were filled with violence.
Against bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.
The corruption has grown incontinent, and the people involved have already bought votes in the election…” “people with nature is not applied for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul” … “we started really talk about the fact that the only medicine in this grave situation an autocracy is a strong man, and that should be chosen” … Appian thought it at Pompey, but the strong man was finally Caesar, the democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, is based in today's society as well as in ancient times on the reckless preference to its own advantage, without societal interests into account.
The private sector is by its very nature, is not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society to recognise and enforce.
The result, then as now, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, not the slightest concern for deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we must, therefore, in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The current condition, can the demise of this regime in favour of liberal democracies, are regarded as some break in the next round is already taking shape.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have witnessed already today, as well as crimes against humanity, as we have from the older and newer history know, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on a not-for-profit work here is not a solution, or at least no lasting.
Under the pressure of the global and european economic competition in the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to make social level of population down.
This trend is therefore bound.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that the capital of the state of the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and the private sector monopoly position in society in favor of the state.
