Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could be a windfall for the cornerstone of peace
Is it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations, countless buildings into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed-and for the first time, rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of the israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians in their historic conflict seem to be caught, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally end.
A war that neither will be won or lost
At first glance, optimism, given the current situation inappropriate.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, the week's fighting Hartgesottenen on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, even though his group itself has seen major losses.
Although several Hamas leaders were killed and the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip, in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel, yet managed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, the Hamas in the West Bank, which Fatah's rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe is controlled.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
So, as islamists in the arab world have grown in influence, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a regional power wiedererstarkende, once known as Israel's closest muslim ally has for Hamas party-as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an islamic crescent-from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren-style before the Stürzung Bashar Assad's regime could, to Jordan, where Hamas allies of the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, far and away the most important arab einwohnerstärksten and land on the southern flank of Israel has greatly altered the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's secular despot, until his fall 2011 ruled for 30 years, had little time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders verschwägert Volksansichten more dependent.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove to Hamas as a player, even from Israel and the United States are not excluded.
Israeli hardliners, however, suggest an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer dangerous.
Israel's “Iron Dome” missile defense system, has been able to prove and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel is sleep.
In diplomatic terms, the United States steadfast in its position, many european countries have Hamas for the latest escalation.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has largely ignored.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004, some 30 Israelis were killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers remained, not least thanks to the security wall in the West Bank, and thus in the body of an eventual palestinian state hineinverlaufen. protect the jewish settlements, which are illegal under international law for have been declared, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu is good because his Likud Party in the run-up to the election on 22 January, Avigdor Lieberman with a still kämpferischeren allied group.
Why this nanny hinterlistigen Palestinians and give them a state of their own devices?
If they are really controlling the West Bank, would it not just as their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip also fire missiles?
No, it is better to have them behind the wall at bay and to punish them if they dare to the heads.
Perhaps it will be the hardliners prevail, but the Arab Spring, they may be thwarted in that.
Even if the Islamists, now in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will look first to the difficulties in their own country.
The Israel's defense budget is larger than the four of its Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will be the new Arab governments to refurbish their economy is unlikely to help.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama teamed up to bring about a ceasefire could be a promising sign-and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination, a powder keg, which no doubt one day in the Israeli-occupied territories will explode, just as this week with a bus in Tel Aviv, exploded.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Missions for the bloody suppression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will, over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The right answer is that which the more prudent representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and will be represented by this newspaper: two states, in which Israel for security purposes areas is stepping down.
For the near future, the small-hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now get together with Turkey and Qatar the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and is better placed than ever before to Hamas to the idea of a jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
Outside arab nations should also Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
That would be more for the creation of a palestinian state as done with the imminent request for UN observer status.
Obama must also play its part in Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he lost the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is as a reluctant participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
