Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was at a meeting with him of the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a twentieth member of this space. Poland is the second member of the former Eastern bloc countries (in the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994 of close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years in several ESA projects.
The path of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, the Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with space, so that it is not always met on understanding.
I refer, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author of ideas from his pioneering “entrance to Kosmonautik presented.”
The ideas of the young engineer (another 1905.) left the audience, however, cold, and after years of recalled Šternfeld yet that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the 1934 “year for entrance to the Kosmonautik” by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André delivered Prix RDP-Louis Hirsch Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis internationally recognised contribution to the development of space was by acknowledged that one of the crater erdabgewandten on the side of the moon has been named after him.
Earlier in the year was 1925 in Poland to a railway-building, for which a Draisine Raketenantrieb was planned.
The author of the proposal and the details of this project is unfortunately remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket or the brakes are activated the Draisine should be used.
The data come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, began the polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen shells.
The research led the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents that the research stage to the practical test was developed.
The research was then, but by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht suspended.
In 1937, appeared in the press by Ing. Rohoziński originating fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete on draft, and the following year was the work of “Rakieta-torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza” the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealing with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for military use of missile technology from temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy) - coordinated.
The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of work was his work, however, by the war ended.
Other articles on space travel appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the polish press.
The first mention of this society is in the 1954 Novemberausgabe Problemy magazine, in which four long articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to create a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future of space exploration.
At its inception in 1956 to the polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accede to the 1951 founded International Federation for space and, in fact, the PTA is already in the fall of 1956 ordinary member.
The following year, the first chairman of the PTA-Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
In this role he had, until his death in 1959.
Since 1956 played the PTA was instrumental in the development of the very successful missile (meteorological Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start came on 10 October 1958.
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 feet long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1a, built in 1959 and began in the desert with the Błędów-Flugtests Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development should already be capable of real scientific work to make the missile-RM-34 to an altitude of up to 14.5 km and reach for the observation of Höhenwinden are in use.
In 1962, however, was the further development.
The first rocket-type RM was in the years 1962 to 1965 developed Meteor-1 rocket.
The missile was conceived as a Zweistufenrakete, their overall length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Of these, three types of missile developed (Meteor-1A, 1B-and-1c states), which are the size of Transportraums for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1a missile had a transport with 0.4 5 litres, Meteor-1b on 0,34 litres and Meteor-1c states on 0,62 litres.
The maximum altitude in all three types of 37 km.
In the years in 1965 to 1968 Luftfahrtinstitut the Meteor-2 rocket, developed the first Flugtests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was capable of a Nutzlast 10 kg in a level of around 60 km.
Since then, the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 built.
It is also worth of Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, two years later, the creation of a national committee COSPAR followed.
Poland participated in the programme also Interkosmos in space research with soviet satellites, and in 1978, the polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut second.
