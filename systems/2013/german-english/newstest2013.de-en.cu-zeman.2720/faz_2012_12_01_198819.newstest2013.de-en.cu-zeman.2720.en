“Brand protection” in China: if China is suddenly an Armani and Puma
An Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is an Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a in China are officially registered name, but they are not about the Ursprungsunternehmen has to do.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection so long as the real Lord who brought us not suing.
And even then, it is not clear whether it was right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners, to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in the Chancellery Taylor Wessing on Schutzrechtsverletzungen specialises in the Far East.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
The rich imitators have a couple of additional letters, so they must register their trademarks.
So will simply Lu-from Gucci Gucci, Prada, Prada-Kny register.
German companies are also in this way, legally copied around the sports goods manufacturers Puma.
Pattloch opens up a raft of registration with the Community Trade Mark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a chinese company's trademark Zegna DF Puma, a somewhat synthetic label, which is also the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna used.
The chinese world champion in copying and violating intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are almost exclusively mehrstöckige department stores, which sell counterfeits.
Pattlochs cases but are different: on behalf of his client, it is the fact that chinese companies by the Patent Office as officially given the right to use the name, already elsewhere is protected.
The chinese call this “Bang,” a Mingpai Beifahrermarke.
The word is based on “Bang Dakuan.”
So are women, rich men angling.
The chinese authorities are aware of any blame
“It will be bad for business, we have to combat it,” urges Pattloch.
“The brand is being watered down, the Alleinstellung disappears, the damage is enormous.”
The financial losses and higher litigation costs of the industries affected are in the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year's third largest market for luxury goods, and the fastest growing.
But erased entries in the dubious Markenregister are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the proceedings drag on, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints, because after a long objected to the name “reality”.
If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he must pay the Plagiator even money because its brand in China, says Pattloch injured.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases concern also graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, that company, which recently took over the german Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister.
The Chinese must therefore until now an emblem of using the Mercedes-star resembles.
The Volvo, Geely buyers originally used a blue and white logo, BMW recalled; the dispute was resolved, Geely has had to change it.
The Lacoste Modehersteller lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile in the other direction to look.
The chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The Patent Office CTMO in Beijing, while that of 2010 due to lower personnel and Raumausstattung bottlenecks.
Last year was one of the “emergency situation in business returned to normal life.”
So is the stock unbearbeiteter appeals by 22%.
Almost 57 000 such cases have been completed, 75 per cent more than in the previous year.
Yet waiting in the office still 81.500 objections to settlement.
Address it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China and for the tenth consecutive year, the list of Neuanmeldungen throughout the world, shares with the authority.
This also applies to the existence of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 were 1.8 billion yuan in fees earned.
Simply, this means that any application in an average of 160 1280 yen or euro costs.
Address it costing many times, as the case of the german family firm Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years of fighting, the company against a chinese Plagiator.
It is true that the Germans that the illegal manufacture of imitation Kraftfahrzeugteile unearthed.
But secured the imitators continue to the chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
We even have failed in this, as in Germany, not family name could be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Patent Office CTMO rejected the objection to the Munich as well.
In the next two bodies, Freudenberg may be right, but the fighting Prozessgegner until further today.
You have to watch your step
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: “the process is extremely expensive, and it costs us a lot of time, money and stress.”
The internal costs could not quantify the Firmenarchiv have even a hundred years old files they need, in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain for a “high six-figure Eurobetrag”.
“This shows how much it is worth to us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East to Europe even threaten zurückzuschwappen.
That is, if there are imitators vulnerable brands.
It is a chinese manufacturers in Germany, the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of business the company anymore, yet he has the registration.
“You have to watch your step,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise german companies when dealing with China is to be careful.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners “everything that is worth protecting, also known in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg Markendramas is governed by its last act, then we should do the other side pay royalties for its own name, said Wentzler.
Or we will be in the segment in question out of the market.
