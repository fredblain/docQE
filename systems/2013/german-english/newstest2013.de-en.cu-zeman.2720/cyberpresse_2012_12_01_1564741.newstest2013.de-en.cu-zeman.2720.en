Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the test should be made or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes flawed results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater reluctance of the men already undecided for the implementation of Früherkennungstests.
The test should be made or not?
We have the views of two doctors.
In the studies conducted in the United States, insisted many confounding factors between the control, so it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that when Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of the likelihood of the education of metastases by 30-40% higher if there is no screening was carried out.
I therefore recommend that the test from the age of 50 years, or 40 years ago, when a direct relatives, already in the prostate cancer was diagnosed.
Men in african-american origin, there is also a greater risk.
The most important thing is to make the right choice as soon as a cancer diagnosed.
There are cancers that aggressively and others, the indolent.
The patient, the extent of the risk of his cancer really was made clear by the possible options, in which Prostatakrebse remain untouched if the quality of life in the long term is not affected, and in these cases is more of an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, for many men, the cancer has seen no treatment, because their cancer is aggressive and not a threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and give them in advance of the disease treatment.
It certainly with increasing accuracy the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who does not.
I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests.
It is most important, but with his doctor to talk in order to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international society for Movember Urologie has developed a device with which it is possible to the pros and cons of the PSA tests to assess.

Prevention of the disease.
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research is adopting a healthy lifestyle, the best way to minimise the risk of it becoming ill.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eating well and get enough.
“If there are no more smokers, this value at at least a 50% increase,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the canadian Krebsgesellschaft.
But it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several also remain unresolved.
For the canadian Krebsgesellschaft remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of people.
“Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of disease.
They seem to be the risk of breast, Grimmdarm-Mastdarm-Speiseröhren-neuronal and uterine cancer.
“The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects”, he added.
The diet
The organisation also recommends the consumption of red meat.
In great quantity, it increases the risk of a fairy tale or of becoming ill.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking or drying Salzen can lead to formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the cells and the development of cancer,” he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, a number of scientists, the connection between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer.
Your investigation, but is not conclusive.
After the canadian Krebsgesellschaft are the studies on vitamin E, contradictory.
While the study may reduce the risk of prostate cancer has discovered a different, more of an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also not yet clear.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family kind.
“The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer.”
