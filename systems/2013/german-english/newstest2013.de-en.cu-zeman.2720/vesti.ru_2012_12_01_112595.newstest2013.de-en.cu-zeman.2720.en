Born in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with Erdbewohnern on board are seeking a Ersatzplaneten.
In order to save humanity, is a major issue, as we in the zero gravity or the Ersatzplaneten breed?
There are many choices in my opinion, no.
In fact there are only two real planet we inhabit could at least hypothetical.
Nämlich “Mars and Venus”, says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on mars, there is comparatively enjoyable on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life is only in height or in the orbit of Venus, therefore, possible in space.
The issue of reproduction in space, the researchers treated first with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the in-orbit different varieties of peas, not in the slightest by the earthly species.
What followed was the creation of insects, tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 Wachteleier were sent to outer space to explore how the zero gravity on the development of embryos.
It is developing a normal chicks.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it needs to be on his legs and can begin to move,” explained the laboratory officials of the Institute for medical and biological problems Ran, Vladimir Sychew.
Without deep underground, the chicks have been falling in the wild.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and-like.
Four days later they died off.
“We left Zweimal chicks slip, and then the whole thing, because it is simply impossible, to work with them,” Vladimir Sychew considers the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last Brutkäfig with animals flew 16 years in orbit.
In the spring of 2013, will continue the experiments.
However, on the “same-sex” Biosatelliten Bion only species.
There was an experiment with rats, which already fertilized, were sent into space.
In principle, it was anything special.
“That was just the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue,” said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the Weltraumratten offspring.
The issue of reproduction directly in space could have not so far been resolved.
The task is difficult.
The animals from their natural habitats can simply be taken their Fortpflanzungstrieb not follow.
In contrast to the man the animals could in principle.
Homo sapiens is thinking abstraktem capable and can produce a similar emotional backdrop.
For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk of Tereshkova.
The Wertvollste that mankind is the female body.
Our Möwe flew, and no one on earth would answer the following question: can it weathers the Weltraumflug?
After this flight, it will bring a child into the world?
“After all, nobody answered that question,” says Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after its Weltraumflug, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The child's father, was also Andrijan Nikolajew militiamen.
In 1988, is the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, which twice in orbit was, and even if they work outside the Raumfahrzeugs, a son.
Nevertheless, it remains a risk.
We have extremely few cosmonaut, after long flights in which everything went well and healthy offspring.
“The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit,” concludes militiamen Valery Poliakov quite rightly, hero, hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.
And yet, the race for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the artificial Erzeugen Gravitation.
The Hydrolabor Vorbereitungszentrum in the cosmonaut is mandatory at the station to perform.
Here, in a state of flux, winning the cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
The water is the zero gravity.
Although adult water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but babies feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander witness to that life in the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it was easier to water used.
In principle this is logical, as from birth until the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little time to forget,” says Marina Babyschwimmlehrerin Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the zero gravity is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of zero gravity, the belly and Beckenmuskulatur enormous speed back, and thus the ability to extract the baby.
Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could, for example, in a Spezialkammer held to the child of squeezing.
“But what happens then?” is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poliakov quite rightly.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung to feel, the organism the skeleton and muscles do not train.
A newborn baby is in orbit, not as an adult to train in a Belastungsanzug.
It is simply the lack of what his life is of fundamental importance.
“This experiment, which together we make, the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to a disabled, a completely unangepassten people will bring to the world,” says the head of the Institute for Bioethikkommission medical and biological problems Ran, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space, mere theory.
At some point, but the reality of it, if the people in their spacecraft to a distant planet, head of the home for their offspring born in space.
