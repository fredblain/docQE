A cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the inquiry confirmed that HIV-positive.
“It was as if a bombshell,” he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, the doctor with no discernible success “tried to weaken.”
He hid it in his family.
He chose to be alone with his disease and began to inform itself; and that with such commitment that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients of the unity of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s, when it was hard to imagine many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, avoiding even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to adopt “because it led to a dead end.”
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible that this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.
However, many people are still in the hospital, none of their disease and know where the virus already has harmed and her immune system has run out, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the publication of AIDS in the world, i. e., the date of the first reported cases, means “the great success today that the survival of a patient's treatment in time, and the survival of the general population exactly are the same,” said the head of the HIV-unity of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information in April this year by a reputable scientific publication had been based.
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life to the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of the treatment depended, and that those who do not have greater opportunities are dependent on drugs: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that anyone under the age of 25 years of the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in that sense, “easily 75 years old can be as long as he is under control,” he said.
This progress with properly needs to be reminded that the life expectancy of the Mexicans live an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS by 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report) reduced the ONUSIDA), it is nevertheless true that since the AIDS 60 per cent of the national database covered patients have died.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and up to the month of May this year there are 187 deaths; it will, however, be assured that, since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral drugs.
Why are people still die in that?
I think the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no problems of supply of the drugs; the problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their Infektionszustand, i. e. in a very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: “nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have an accompanying infection. global mortality can influence, earlier diagnosis, which is why all the people, where necessary, massive screening tests should be offered.”
This proposal are the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida (en) (Coesida Jalisco state committee to AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio to the test at a private laboratory carried out, and it was only because a friend he had made, despite his young age already in the AIDS era, and even the Kaposi Sarkom krebsartigen tumor - (a), as one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we want to hear anything.
“If I have to die, then it is better to burst” three times, as we say in my case.
The change was designed to improve ernähre me out, I corner well, sport and take the medication.
Today his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
“I am working, doing much to have an active sex lives, but responsible, I respect on my health and that of the other person,” Fabrizio, counts on the agreed with his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global AIDS day fear.
You should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group, the sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they are already aware of the diagnosis, they have to learn how to live as all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Behind the counter condoms
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV has adopted.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In some places it was “the distribution of condoms actually increased; previously they were individually made, now give us packages with a hundred piece of what is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom,” he said.
The Risikopersonen for new infections are among the young.
“What do you need?” is a common form of social workers, Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal in schools, staff at pharmacies and in the health care system, the young people do not want to expose, assured the correspondent.
He suggested that these inefficient distribution to change the direction; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in Ausgabegeräten in public toilets of institutions, often by young people.
It should not be encouraged promiscuity.
They are not the beer and Motel will be paid, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether, under its management condoms will be distributed.
“Sexuality is not enough; it is best that condoms those closer to the sexual activity”, he got straight to the point.
Key facts of Jalisco

The state is seen in National 4. place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV.
92% of Ansteckungsfälle takes place through sexual intercourse, 6% on the blood and perinatal 2%.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because for every registered 4 or 5, there are people who do not know.
