In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport, unexpectedly, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
I had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not want to lie.
Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait is quite nervtötend-even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course Tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more graduates and lead Kindesentwicklungsexperten boredom as something positive.
If it were up to them, it is for us, and our children-ok, sometimes to be bored.
So that the brain is forced into interesting thoughts to lose, whatever the creativity.
And because most of us these days almost permanently on the other screen or a rigid, brings the benefits of boredom, not more.
The boredom, so we should welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back once again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, with increased leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of “Boredom: a Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011), sees it that way.
“In fact, the boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The Hauswände Pompejis signs a latin inscriptions on boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long, reading Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of around 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom than the experience, “a satisfactory job, but it does not want to be able to define.”
Boredom is different from apathy, therefore, that the person is not employed, but would like to be.
The apathy, on the other hand, there is no rush to do something.
The Schlüsselerfahrung boredom, he says, is to “disrupt Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with bad mood and feel that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can almost hear such as depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions could be linked, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that us is dull, even if we only have problems, we have to focus on.
In its study, “the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention” in German, for example: “the inert minds: the definition of boredom in the light of the attention in September in the journal “Perspectives on Psychological Science” appeared, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, in which participants listening to a band, in which a person a Magazinartikel read.
Some groups have heard a loud television channel from neighbouring areas, which has nothing to do with the content had heard it on other low-volume, so it was almost invisible, while the third group was not hear these noises.
The people who are barely recognisable television echoes surveyed, more boring than the other two groups, to feel they have had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this, and wrote of their difficulties of boredom.
When you try to take on a difficult and arduous task to focus the attention of the disorder can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you have a dreary work - “like the search for faulty products on a Fabrikförderband, music can distract and help, not to feel bored.”
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people who physically can fight to remain alert.
“Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln should learn more and more information than those who keep the Stillsitzen be forced,” Professor Fenske.
All of us at some point my boring-delayed flight, a loudspeaker dröhnender, a particularly tedious film.
But some people are bored more easily than others.
These differences in order to measure, developed by researchers in the 1980's, a “scale of Langeweileanfälligkeit.”
At the bottom there are statements such as “many things that I have to do to repeat themselves and are monotonously” and “I have so many interests that I did not have enough time for everything.”
With the help of such scale, researchers found that boys more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida-particularly on the need for more and more diverse external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a fairly abgespannter bunch.
In 1991 led Reed Larson, a professor of human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents for seven or eight times a day with a Pager kontaktierte.
He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and the homework Erledigen were bored, while 23% said that seem to be, if they are not in school.
But only 3% of the parents surveyed, bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages of boredom, increase or decrease.
He was sure, however, that “the youth is regarded as a particularly boring,” mainly because children and teenagers do not have a big influence on their Alltagsablauf.
So, back to my Ursprungsfrage: boredom is healthy?
In the extreme, sometimes not, because it leads to extreme physical people to take risks and the gambling or drugs, in order to alleviate, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. Vodanovich, this view is Professor of the subject for more than two decades.
“With the boredom to the brain of a saying that we should do something different,” Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what is best to do.
If one is dull and the energy used to Gitarre to play and cook will be happy.
But television can do in the short term to ensure that these Glücksgefühle verflüchtigen long term but again.
So, a child who his gelangweilten iPad is enough, it can distract from the boredom; it has not learned to run or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “self-regulation spreads from one situation to the other.”
The child is learning not just to entertain but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not to be critical.
Instead, our goal should be to us outside of the permanent Aktivitäts Technologieberieselung and at ease.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds as if we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
He believes that people have in fact, look for a way to switch off and relax.
“In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert will find it hard to look at when the noise has fallen silent again.”
