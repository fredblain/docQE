“The great and powerful” leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While lawmakers and civil rights activist, discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants to be criminals already with fake certificates
Each year, 13 million migrant workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to pay for the maintenance of the home in the remaining families to earn.
On 1 December, a law that everyone working immigrant a test of knowledge of the russian language, must.
So far, the scheme for migrants in the services sector, in the local housing stock and want to work in the retail sector.
However, should the tests in time, according to federal Migrationsbehörde future for all workers to be compulsory.
It must not only language tests, but also tests in russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills, both for preserving and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which language is Russian.
Also exempt from this legislation are people their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, and the protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the Prüfungsstellen will, under the aegis of the Pushkin-Institute for the russian language, the Russian's university, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other universities are russian.
The migrants can take the tests in all the cities, have already been in Russia already has more than 160 such centres open.
The initiative to introduce the tests by the members of the State Duma and the federal Migrationsbehörde supports.
Civil rights activist, on the other hand, prior to the entry into force of the law in the press several times to the following question: what does it really mean?
What changes does the obligatory language skills to show, both for the Russians and for guest workers?
Above all, say, spokesman for the Migrationsbehörde is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labour.
“Many are talking now about protecting the rights of migrant workers,” says the head of the representation of the federal Migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Your rights before their departure, however, must be protected.
Only an organized recruitment is 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Confronted with problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future without migrant language skills, inevitably, people with bad intentions will encounter him, under the pretext of aid in the dark, narrow shack, where he met dozens of his ilk months without food and documents to stay and 12 to 14 hours a day of cronies.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
“The home is one thing you promised, and upon arrival, you cheated to get their passports taken and do not receive the promised pay”, confirmed that the head of the headquarters for migration, the Tajik Migrationsbehörde Tolib Schwaripow.
Not having a go, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who earn their money, not just that they do not speak the language of the destination, but also in their own language can hardly express in writing.
Of course this is not their fault, rather than the evil: only a few of the Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks, too, can only afford a decent education.
Because in their families are not even money to feed the children, let alone to them a decent clothing, footwear and Schulsachen to buy.
As a teenager to take these children to the first opportunity to make money.
“It is difficult without language skills,” they said.
“You fühlst you humiliated and inferior.”
Civil rights activists say the law regarding the following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You have this status, so there is no investigation and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers remain illegal in Russia.
“Warmly welcome” or “entry of unauthorised persons banned”
Many migrants to confirm that it is not easy to Russia in an official status.
Because of bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
It also costs money: the legalization of 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the russian police know that our largely fabricated documents and we are not registered, and then there are cases of extortion.
“You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea”, is the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
“Just no cost for false papers shy”
Earlier in the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only was the Registrierungsdokumente migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates, which the completion of the language tests have already been telling staff the federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary Farbdrucker.
Naturally, the new owners are not in vain: each migrant who hoped that such tests can save, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that not just the certificates can be bought, are both officials and civil rights activist, agreed.
For the moment, the public authorities can immigrant workers, the first time through the test, only promise that it is time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
There will also be new arrivals without knowledge of languages offered posts in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
