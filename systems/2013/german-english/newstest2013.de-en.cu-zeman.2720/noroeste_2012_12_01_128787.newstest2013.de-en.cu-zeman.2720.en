After the Court of Appeal judgment of the United States has confirmed that the restructuring of the liabilities of the group Vitro does not recognise, that have a Handelskonkurs in Mexico was reached a pernicious precedent for every national companies with operations in neighbouring created, the insolvency.
You could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies, which the mexican laws allow, in the land of stars and stripes in conflict with international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the judgment on June 15, recognition of the ruling by the judge at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale of the Northern District of Texas, the mexican company the confiscation of their property from the other side of the River Bravo helpless are exposed.
However, the decision opens up the largest Glashersteller in Mexico and, because of inconsistencies in three of the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the cause of the judges pointed out that the creditors in the bankruptcy law of the United States must be subject to the Court of Appeal, says of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first, that the main proceedings for the Handelskonkurs treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation on procedures in default by companies with trans-national profile is not known.
Indeed, for this purpose the Modellgesetz the United Nations for the unification of international trade law created, with the American Law Institute was set up as an arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the societies after the recognition of liabilities in the liquidation, the branches of Vitro, with its parent company, not the majority needed for the restructuring of the liabilities have been achieved.
But this is the way of the mexican laws recognized.
Indeed, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities from businesses of the group from Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Handelskonkurse) were confirmed.
It is also true that, after deducting the voices of the branches of Vitro creditors, the creditors in the courts of the United States against suing Vitro, i. e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, a majority have reached.
The vote would be 45% to 37%.
This is not taken into consideration by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there are Vitro blame for its difficult situation in 2008 under the severe economic crisis in the United States, the country hits.
For this reason, the Sada family González before the same court of contradiction to the vote in the House, i. e. of all the judges, because only three of them voted.
It is not granted, the Cerciorare-lodged, the review of the procedure by a higher body calls for, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Schwerwiegende in this case is that the court is a document put to one side of the Government of Mexico under the amicus curiae Figura (friend of the court), what the broadcast of Vitro procedure within the framework of the law on Handelskonkurse described, and noting that it is strictly to the agreement signed by the two countries had kept to the chapter on 15 of the bankruptcy of the United States.
It also pointed out that the country was the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade domination, i. e. the rules laid down for the cross-border insolvency, the equality between debtors and creditors.
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
