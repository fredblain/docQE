NKÚ chief: control of the black-and-system failed by fault of the policy
The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts on good inspection and adequate laws, but in its application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně. cz says that the Vice-President of the highest Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied right-and I think that this is not the case,” kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result is apparently a common control by czech and german investigators.
But a negative Praxisbeispiel leading the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas, on the so-called “black” system.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls would not bite, the system is now banned or permitted?
“A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the Regierungsvorsitzende come from, and this one, whose duty is to monitoring the implementation of the law is in its work, hinder,” kala.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a common Czech-german project, in which the laws of both countries in terms of public contracts compared with each other.
What did it mean?
It is the result of a parallel investigation with which we have started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is important to ensure that the european legislature to decide how to handle public contracts are to build the national legislation, and finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation has not yet been completed, we have very interesting differences, generally speaking, are the laws we are perhaps even more “strict and perfect,” the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more precise rules we must also address the actual implementation of the law.
How can you help the project? what is for you from this project?
Just such a common control could help that we stop us constantly to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds to try, if it is apparently not particularly positive.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and illegal enrichment or even criminal actions.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this objective.
It may even be that the system in this way only with “excessive” paperwork burden on those who look for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, rather than the higher thresholds.
You talk about the problems in the practical application of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.
How the system works in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, it is the german equivalent to the NKÚ the General Accounting Office, the similarly structured is like us, and also on a college, which is only slightly different. both authorities, however, similar in principle.
The powers are to a certain extent comparable, with Germany, however, is a federal state, i. e. that it is these courts in individual states-is what distinguishes the german system of our.
The only federal funding BRH cannot control what our government funds.
Public funds in the us from the districts and municipalities are managed there are subject to the control of the let.
What the german legislation, it is easier than ours?
In general I would do this without any concrete data to compare, but Germany is, in some ways, often described as a model, but certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better.
This is perhaps because the auditors are better?
Certainly not, but, as I said, such comparisons may not particularly like.
This is to note that even those countries which, for us, is a model, are also struggling with problems to have.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, is it not?
What the czech legislation, what was important for your authority to review the Vergabegesetzes, feel they have any impact?
Given that this novella in force for only a short time, in our tests, it is still not enough.
Since our checks subsequently take place, it must be here with some delay.
We feel so far more impact in the phase of future controls – as we have new control “hazard” introduced the inefficiency and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed-you will see the changes, of course, because the thresholds to change the conditions for certain types of alerts modified and others.
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or will the system with more red tape?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, there is the problem that the rules “strict” and no longer can be met.
Under the previous rules, a test unterzogenen persons against the winner (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the regional council) accountable for any breach of the Vergabegesetzes a breach of discipline.
Is it useful, however, the law is even tougher to make?
I do not believe in this way.
The system has to exclude those who want to abuse the system and attacking, not penalise those who have committed a mistake on the real decision making.
Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say, first of all, what is not successful.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called “black-and-system” - although what exactly does this mean?
Is the black-and-system now banned or permitted?
A law, but its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply the Regierungsvorsitzende come from, and this one, whose duty is to monitoring the implementation of the law is, in his work.
He can say: “we change the law and allow the thing,” but he could not say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The Vergabegesetz contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions-and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone due to procedural irregularities.
The law is never perfect, but it needs to be properly applied and that is what I think is missing.
