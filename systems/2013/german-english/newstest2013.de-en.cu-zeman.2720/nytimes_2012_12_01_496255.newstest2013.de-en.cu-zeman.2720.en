In Colorado, there is no clear guidance on the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for an offence in court, which in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a pipe with which he smoked it.
Orozco was that he and some friends on a Septembertag drive in Lamar near the Kansas border, when they were stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Orozco had been in the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien summoned-Kavaliersdelikte, each with a fine of $100 and have received a court hearing.
“We are being treated like criminals,” Orozco.
But is he?
In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use, to legalise the answer depends in hundreds of smaller, less drug-related crimes by the law, as the site.
Hundreds of offences to be marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures, have already dropped.
The police authorities pursue adults over 21 years ago no longer for possession of small-scale, which is legally permitted once the new legislation in the coming weeks to enter into force.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that existing Marihuanadelikte quote and people are still on trial.
At the same time, in a number of cities, suburbs of the Denvers until the Western Mountains on new, state-licensed Marihuanageschäfte attended the opening of their communities.
“This situation is evolving so rapidly, that I do not know what will happen next,” says Daniel J. Oates, chief of the theater in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington, scratch their heads at a loss.
They are waiting for a road map for establishing a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug-and have been given a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, we are of the view that Colorado, in every case, most states is ahead of what the regulation of marijuana is where the drug only for medical purposes and then Eigenkonsum legalised.
“Colorado has a more regulated market. the state lends itself so well to guide,” says Brian D. Smith, the spokesman for the Insurance spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith is also on the ground or that no system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide to serve.
“We have no real precedent that we can follow,” he adds.
The Washington law, known as I-502, enters into force on 6 December and is thus also the conclusion of a grey area in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalised.
And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be clarified in this time around, such as the imposition of a state of “fair access” to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of Cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare centres should be agreed.
“Nowhere is it more difficult to be a location for a lizenziertes Cannabisgeschäft to find than in urban areas, especially in the conurbation of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the “Center for Legal cannabis,” a recently formed research group.
On 21 November Chief Oates sent his staff theater in Aurora, an e-mail in which he said the prosecutor would be smaller Marihuanadelikte among people over 21 years, no longer, and that the police had “immediately” no prosecutions for such offences will strive for.
Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban standards to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers will continue to prevail.
In Weld County in northern Colorado represents Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken Buck a harsher view.
After the vote, he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly to consumers for withdrawing.
Currently, 119 people for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana on trial, although many also for other offences have been indicted.
“Our agency has the duty to monitor violations, which are the Tatzeitpunkt crime was,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions themselves are in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, is ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the Landkreises shows for the possession of small quantities of adults no longer.
Bezirksstaatsanwalt Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided to add, however, not all outstanding Besitzverfahren fall.
“I do not think that I waste my time in order to enforce the law until it is changed,” he says.
While 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the beginning that this would not be a simple matter, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state that encouraged local officials under a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.
In Bezirksstaatsanwälten was an “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for the defendants Marihuanadelikte in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the national organization to reform Marihuanagesetzen operates.
“You have such a large part of their lives, to prosecute people for the legalisation, that they still cannot accept,” he believes.
The first states that smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol will deal with Colorado and Washington as a national test-cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare a legal age sales, they also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level to continue to treat as a crime.
The Legalisierungsbewegung advocates hope that the Justice Ministry to give in.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical Marihuanas has the federal government, the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states, for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former-drug policy advisor to the Obama Administration believes that Kriminalbeamte probably no doors are leading to smaller quantities of drugs seized, but is likely to resist that, under the new legislation, state-regulated legal marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado did not even wait for the federal authorities to act.
Before the election, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana business, although this is only open in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a town in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
“We do not want to get into a position where we license and then somebody at the federal level have a huge problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
Our community has voted against the change in the law.
We have, for which the community has decided and did not ask for what the state has decided.
There are still many unanswered questions.
