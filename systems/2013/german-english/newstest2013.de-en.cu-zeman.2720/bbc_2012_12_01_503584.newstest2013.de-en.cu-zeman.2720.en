Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto on his arrival, Will Grant analysis prepared by the BBC which he challenges and the mixed emotions of his people.
Currently, the movement in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, it is always a congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel, built several key routes in the capital absperrt and on the roads is causing havoc.
The aim was not, however, commuters on their way to work to disrupt, but protesters to prevent the Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto the Präsidentenbinde received and the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon's Mexico has been economically well able to prove, but the country is in the grip of a drug war which, in the last six years already 60,000 lives.
“My government is strongly committed to the violence,” Pena Nieto said at the beginning of this week, in the Oval Office of the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he was with the US President on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was governor than his Heimatstaats Mexico.
In this sprawling, densely populated part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo is remembered, for example, like to him.
Inhabitants of the Urlaubsorts write him the development of tourism and the building of the infrastructure.
Around the city, can be found on one of the highways, Pena Nieto has left the building and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that it once was.
With his name badges also depend on outside of a modern Sportzentrums an impressive and interactive museum on climate change.
“We expect it to real and lasting change,” as his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, who as a congressman for the Party Pena Nietos, the PRI is working.
In particular, regarding the safety and economy, we hope to have an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations from the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a man very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, but he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the paved roads of Valle del Bravo not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and to combat violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a corner of fallow land near a large garbage dump, in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murders of women left behind.
During the administration of Governor Pena Nieto were in the state of Mexico, more than 1,000 women are murdered-a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez than for their violence and the killing of innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the view that the problem of the murders of women during his time in office, at least not properly addressed.

The official version of the events, according to Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if their bodies washed,” remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already used.
While their mother told her story, looks up from the wall a picture of Mariana on us down. it is in addition to a cross, a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family has until now denied.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.
You want to just accept their verdict and mouths.
“But this is not possible when there are so many errors and omissions,” she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde receives, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of mexican families were in the last six years of violent crimes affected, and the new president has promised during his tenure, especially in order to take care of this problem.
“I hope that, as President, he is so as governor, as he was,” says the PRI congressmen Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But fear of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most.
