The MVRDV architects to show that the real adventure is not only in the head-on example from Spijkenisse, and the newly-created Bücherberg 2 photos
“I think the building fun, it looks futuristisch from, and at last there is something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig Passantin, a roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby corporate sector, says: “but it is nice to have the house.”
But I wonder, what we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is yet in one of these Old-Style-libraries, or?
Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt at the gates of Rotterdam, the record holder is outlandish.
The 80,000 residents, community education rates, the lowest of the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid thing, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to education and the seven fictional bridges on the refusing, as nicely bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen depicted.
The success of the training was limited.
And so the Stadtväter realized that there was only one possibility, Mr statistics: a library, ago.
Winy Maas from Rotterdam Architekturbüro MVRDV, master of tollkühnen Balkendiagramme and producer of witzigen cynical, and often works, took up the cause with his usual equanimity and appeared for the hearing on competition in 2003 with five books, the rich and a grin on your face.
And while the jury still intrigued to eyes and wave our hands zuckte stapelte impudent Maas, of his distinguished Mitbringsel in size to a pyramid and ended aktionistisch underpinned his speech with the words: “love Stadtgemeinde!”
It is, therefore, my proposal for the Bücherberg from Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million expensive aufgeschüttet Berg.
It is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts to the underground car park, supermarket, post office, and a couple of adjacent residential and Reihenhäuser with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg with the second best price “Library of NL 2012”.
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 nominated.
So that is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte, which until now have not had to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly behind City Hall, whose white walls, would be inclined to suspect a Molkereifabrik, for a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to books
The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass.
There is admittedly a lift, in the middle of the massif leads, but the real area-and tap the Lesefreuden fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The totally verglaste Innenraum is bright and clear, the shy Klinkerboden and the elegant Straßenlaternen unambiguously speak the language of a public Stadtplatzes.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
People are already looking for Parkbank, dog and played football and boys Mädels.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
“Usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a large, shady areas, which mostly uncongenial and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have the classic Raumkonfiguration upside down and inside out of the Lesebereich enclosing.
The interior of the Bücherbergs is shrewdly: in the middle, library, offices, Internet, and Haustechnikzentrale Schachclub environment centre.
A particular pleasure is the black bookshelves, which, sometimes, sometimes Wandverkleidung Brüstung Stiegengeländer.
Haptik optics, and smell are alien.
Even die-hard architects and whether the unknown Baustoffs Engineers shake their heads.
“We wanted to be here with recycling materials work,” said Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Stadtgemeinde Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen holding one day for a fitting waste product from agriculture.
For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies than Wurzelunterlage.
This is cheap and zeiteffizient.
The textile holds a slender, two Saisonen, then it is ready for the Sperrmüll.
For the library, the fleece-for the first time in these amounts to four-inch thick plates are squeezed.
Under pressure and Hitzeeinwirkung discolour the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogenous, belastungsfähigen material that a bissl after new cars and a bissl after Sportschuh smell.
After 105 stages is at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres will migrate in Literaturcafé with not only a fantastic prospect in the city, but also with dutch Kroketten eingetopften Ficusbäumen and rewarded.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right Luftfeuchtigkeit in Literaturgebirge.
Donations for the new soul
“You would not believe it, but this is in spite of the many Glasflächen a flagship project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz is, it seems, the sun even on sunny days only briefly interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder, across to outside glass of face, serve as such as shadowing and catch a large part of the sun.
The Raumklima is very pleasant.
Do the rest fully automated Rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, has dared to go the way of the new library.
Also, Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde, Boekenberg even as a long-overdue Spijkenisses “soul”.
The reason: the opening of a few weeks ago, everyone residents invited to a book from his personal stock to donate.
That is for another day the optical gaps in the still not fully-stocked library-currently 70,000 piece-are filled.
The concept is good enough.
The shelves are filled up their back teeth.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, each now residents of a certain relationship with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
If only to grace.
It is those MVRDV Königsdisziplin managed, in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse Literaturgeschichte has written.
As young and uneducated, they may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
