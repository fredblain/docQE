Guidelines for inflating balloons of banana, and for the circus
The site www. bankovnipoplatky. com, an annual survey of the most preposterous charges, has declared this year decided that the competition “most absurd regulation or idea from the EU's workshop”.
“On this idea has brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan, a 40% quota of female representation in the management of large european companies to introduce,” said Patrik Nacher, who was responsible for the organisation of this survey, with the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated aberrations we see, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on unifying the Versicherungstarife for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance for insurance companies, because they are objectively less of a risk.
“Other incredible incursions from the EU's workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013,” said Nacher with.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory blend of bio-ethanol fuels in its wake naturschädigend is that of the ban on the reliable mercury thermometers, simply because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes contain, or even the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Erntete criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term “butter” or even a ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 centimeters
The EU machine decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels during the rule of one or more member states are represented (as the Czech Republic is trying, for example, currently with veto threat by the demands of czech banks impose).
Lobbying interests were also discovered that the highest Handelsklasse bananas in the EU at least 14 centimeters long and must be “no Krümmungsanomalie”.
The European Commission argued that with the argument that they are only the mixed harmonisiere national standards, which would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables from the EU against the resistance of some countries already weakened by pointing out that the previous directives to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, in accordance with the balloons in the sale must be equipped with the suggestion that children under eight years Luftballon without the supervision of an adult aufblasen.
The EU, citing an american study, according to the leading cause of balloons in the suffocation of children.
A similar reduction already applies to children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also funny ideas at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive, which european officials themselves-so everyone in the EU's official social function, because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece will not use the name of Macedonia and instead must FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky. com nominee in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, in addition to the aforementioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU, so that the Höchstvolumen in food stocks, which is on the day of our membership of the EU in the area of the Czech Republic are allowed.
The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the set Pilzkonserven volume for us, and a large fine threatened.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them, that they have no sea, or from the idea of grants for applications for grant money.
These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but in Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by this, that we have no sea.
We are in the EU to apply for reimbursement,” declared in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument he gave was that the grain harvest was very high and the government camp following the so-called Interventionseinkäufe were overcrowded.
As a further way to seaports in the Czech Republic, the EU should Palas according to hundreds of millions of euros of us pay.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far in that it is an invitation to tender for the purchase of grain from organised countries who do not have access to the sea.
Grants for requests for funding for the communities of the Department of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US DEU), specifically, if it is the means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen to Brussels.
Eu: bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the Member States are easy targets of criticism that the EU's efforts to regulate and, hence, effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition.
A deeper problem, according to these experts are more the EU grants for projects, which have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of european integration have in common, but when the budget negotiations were forced by individual member states.
Emotions here, also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products have to fight this battle and not always wins.
Although the Czech Republic after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the name “Olomoucké tvarůžky” to defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský Rum), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, had our manufacturers, however, in “Tuzemák rename.”
The name of rum should only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered in the EU products appear in the society of the world-famous cheese, feta and gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinkens Zwieback Karlsbad, now the carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU-brand with the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or Hořicer brags about the roles.
