A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily granted him the unlimited power, more divided than ever, he has decided to put everything in one basket.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly on the next day, its final version will pass.
Just over a week ago, the leader of the House, two additional months for completing its work.
Egypt is based now for almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and a legal mess.
This new initiative only for an even stronger divisions in the country.
For his opponents, primarily the President in his autocratic “Delirium,” he continued to “break his word” and “the right underfoot.”
On the side of his supporters are receiving assurances that the road is the institutional and political crisis to an end as soon as possible and the transition process to be speeded up.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time, the brothers who forces on their plan to forgo the Egyptians and the text of section for section to explain.
For the president, it is also a way of his public and democratic legitimacy, while protests raged across the country.
After you, in an interview with the american Wochenschau Mohamed Morsi Time seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
As the egyptian people with this recourse to a rushed vote an ultimatum: “either it is true for my draft or reserving the unlimited power”, the latter should after the adoption of the constitution supposedly come to an end.
85 largely islamist members of the Constituent Assembly, the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberal Democrats has not responded to the invitation.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, in mid-November, they have avoided, because they believe that they were not able to enforce their views.
Representatives of human rights groups, religious minorities or civil society alike have acted.
To reach the quorum were yesterday morning in 11 people, substitutes, added.
Some are very close to the Moslembrüdern.
It is not surprising that the article mostly passed unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining, incidentally, that the only difference of opinion in the hour of the day … for the prayer was expressed, as some members of the panel believed that the Constituent Assembly Pendeluhr not exactly was.
The text, which yesterday evening has been adopted, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, all the attention, remains, after all, is identical to that of the constitution of 1971, and says that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law”.
The salafi parties for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped that the “principles” with “the rules” to replace a rigorous application, which had made it possible.
For the Islamists, is the fact that this article has not been changed, a testimony to their good will and for your respect for the other members of egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy”, say the liberals, this only as Propagandaschlag look.
They say that is because the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
They have in mind, particularly Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of the Sharia law.
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because “the people who asked our opinion, will not have been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals will also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the university is far less moderate than it is at present.
“At the moment, no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain in the context of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who had worked on this text, do not keep, but academics, some of which were trained in the french system,” soothed Blouet Alexis, a doctoral thesis on the egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.
But he admits that “in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity may be available, because the terms used the religious vocabulary borrows.
It relates in particular to the “islamic jurisprudence, Fiqh” [...] Red.
And in future, raised the question of to what extent Zivilrichter are competent to decide that.”
In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted yesterday sharply criticized because of the far-reaching powers, of which he is the President of the Republic.
The Moslembrüder argue that this compared with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military will review the defence budget to Parliament, but not a National Defense Council.
Also, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have called for.
The latter also share their fears in the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, with serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, no article relates more to the protection of women, highlights Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, is the only positive aspect of the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
It was a word in the previous constitution not included.
While the egyptian president last night on television saying something, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The advocates of the Head of State will march Saturday.
