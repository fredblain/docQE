Messenger: NASA discovered the ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover is probably up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA, the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is the closest to the sun, there are some frozen water from three on Thursday as Fachmagazin published studies have shown.
The probe Messenger have proof that it permanently in the shadow of the region of the planet is the ice sheet.
This should at least 30 centimetres, and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids that may be on the Mercury embarked on.
No one got the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the chief scientist of the Messenger-tube, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life elsewhere in the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Erdenbürgern probes are small robots and telescopes, such as Phoenix, in the depths of outer space to explore.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: small Gucklöcher in vast expanses of never-ending.
The picture comes from a camera, the german researchers from the Max-Planck Institute have developed.

With the telescope, however, the paint better.

Saturn, its rings and, as such, is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe they are the remains of a Saturn moon-of 4.5 billion years ago, disappeared without a trace.
One of the largest and strongest-recordings of the Hubble telescope, the Whirlpool galaxy -
Depending on the colour of the paint will be photographing Spiralgalaxien to true works of art.

This image was taken from optical and X-rays recordings of various telescopes assembled.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years from earth.

In this bright bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, but just gas.
Researchers suspect that he just after the Big Bang, as the universe was mostly hydrogen to find.
Our insights into space: the main telescopes
The telescope should 1608 by Hans Lipperhey invented-even before Galileo Galilei it a year later to Sternenbeobachtung began.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescopes ever greater, and the insight they provide deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, was the Hale telescope-in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego Fernrohr, the biggest in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, US, the Large Binocular Telescope.
It looks into space on two mirror, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio recognise on the Kanareninsel La Palma is huge-alone the mirror to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, in order to save money.
Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of good design: the telescope is in his Höhenwinkel ground-and in his limited mobility.
The hobby-Eberly-telescope in Texas is in Höhenwinkel fixated.
Its special: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is because, despite relatively low Spiegeldurchmesser-to the world's largest Spiegelteleskope differently.
With the help of a Radioteleskops in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) hear researchers space after außerirdischen signals.
The Radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 metres.
In “the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Computerbesitzer anyone can help by as much computing power as he is available.
Look at the observatory European Sternwarte (ESO) in the Andes Chilenischen.
Here, the Very Large Telescope-the very sturdy.
With his total of four mirrors the Fernrohr also the medium-sized Infrarotspektrum ausleuchten.
Also on the chilean ESO Observatory is the European Extremely Large Telescope planned.
Hauptspiegel should be a whopping 42 metre cover from almost a thousand Spiegelelementen together.
With pictures, but not until 2018.
By 2007, the two-Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea volcano hawaiianischen as the biggest in the world.
They offer two mirror ever, with an average of 10 metres.
The Keck telescopes-are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them with the Subaru telescope-and the IRTTF looks to the sky.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge-telescope with a mirror-average of 30 metres.
Here it is on an illustration to marvel.
The most important impressions from space but the Weltraumteleskop Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, looks after extrasolaren Weltraumteleskop Kepler planet-predominantly to be habitable.
On 2 February 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn were identified.
In the picture, the last on Kepler Startvorbereitungen Weltraumteleskop documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not until 2018 on board a Ariane5 rocket into space shot.
The Primärspiegel the Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that the South Pole the Mercury ice exists.
Nonetheless, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger much closer to the North Pole for the planet.
Radarmessungen have for decades suggest that the ice on Mercury.
By the 2004-launched Messenger probe-the first to the Mercury has circled around-the scientists have now certainty.
