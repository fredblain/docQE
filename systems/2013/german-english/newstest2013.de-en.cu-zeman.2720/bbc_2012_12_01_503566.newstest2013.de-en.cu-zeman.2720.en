Rakfisk from Norway: is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards-and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country's appetite for local quite übelriechenden fish have to do?
There is a selection of cheese überreifer.
They are in the midst of a crowd platziere dirtier, more humid Sportkleidung.
And left it there for a week.
So we must be about the smell of nasenbetäubenden Rakfisk imagine, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, around three hours of Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes, and this persistent smell in the air, just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you like stinkend its fish-by up to a year in water ferments.
If Norway in the darkness of the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians will flock to a celebration here in Fagernes, of this, well, really very bestechenden speciality.
“You eat it raw spült it and then, with a glass bottles anymore,” says Halvarsen Havard, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called “Rakfisk General” also organized the festival.
People around us to eat small Fischwürfel and take on large quantities of alcohol.
“People like the Mansche bottles of more than the Rakfisk Havard,” says.
The alcoholic beverage can crowd out the stink.
I get some Häppchen.
If it avoids the Rakfisk in Nasennähe, he is not bad, such as sushi, a rather long coach journey.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer norwegian era, when there were no first and fish in the autumn in luftdichten Salzwasserfässern watered.
In the depths of winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and-no doubt aided by alcohol softer end-eaten.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work are being forced to leave their country and migrated mainly in the US.
Today, the population is growing rapidly, more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health service.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who not so long ago was much richer than Norway, arriving immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important-as a vital, if strictly riechender part of the norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive courts, which you can buy here.
But the fact is, indeed, expensive-a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs impressive 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the press, and most people seem not to care.
Here you still hate it, Anders Breivik to name those racist, right-wing extremists, which last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, it refers only to the “incident on 22 July.”
Norwegians, find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country to such brutal murders is capable of.
The main responsibility for today's wealth is in Norway since the early 1970's, the growth of one of the biggest oil-and-Gasindustrien the world.
“But oil is not the only reason why we are doing well,” says Anna, our waiter, the round trays with mature Rakfisk distributed and with her long blonde hair and blue eyes the Nordic ideal stechend embodies.
We are a prudent-as they say-people.
Your English is just as most people here are impeccable.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting.
Norway, with its oil wealth is very careful handling, a large part of the Branchenerträge will be for the benefit of future generations in a special fund invested.
As in the years leading up to the Great Depression, all the money is raised, they do not, Norway had his wallet firmly closed.
“As long as we go skiing in the winter and in the summer, are able to go, we are very happy,” says Anna.
“And of course Rakfisk eat,” she adds with unbeschwertem laughter.
I am standing in the snow and ask me for any other court-from Rakfisk I have enough.
So an elk burger is in any case something else. enjoy the meat juicy bit of me.
But on the evening of the Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several Olympic venues to organise a Rakfisk-Dinner, in which guests for the best-or perhaps the most challenging Geruchssinne-fish can vote.
There is a live tv with a switch to fly there Showmaster by plates with Rakfisk surrounded.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
“What did you sum up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?”
“Here are our points Havard.”
To applause and laughs.
A man falls from his seat, perhaps overwhelmed by the bottles.
But it is perhaps the stringent haze of the whole fish.
