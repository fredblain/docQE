Palliative care-the best way to die … &pipe; Le Devoir
With its committee for “death with dignity” Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of Lebensendes.
The debate must soon be resumed, although a bill being prepared.
However, in this very important subject much still to do.
Le Devoir, has tried to look as this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer he aufzehrte, he had a period of two years.
“They gave me five years to live, I have seven years managed,” he said, half-hearted in his bed in the home for palliative care-Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, lying, in which he reached the previous day.
“However, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared for,” he says.
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents alone to use the toilet and even to eat.
On the table sits a delicious lunch, he resigned to take a dinner help.
Courageously he manages to smile and even with strangers, which is around him, his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is that one of my cure diarrhoea, as this is humiliating,” he shares with.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man on foot pinkelt,” Brodeur told Pierre, a psychologist in the home-Victor Gadbois.
In return for certain persons Kindheitsphase is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the ability of the person,” a step back, he notes.
Because, according to several people involved in the work of the palliative care to find big events in the middle of these setbacks.
The patients in the home for palliative care-Victor Gadbois be sent, are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who care for them, not with the so-called “curative care.”
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, “deliberately and by suffocation” to die.
But as a result of the disease, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I have no wishes more in life,” she says, before they accepted that if a mask of her injury, her breathing helps.
You expected in the next few days, despite a recent visit to her son, who is from Italy.
In the home-Victor Gadbois provides you with a group of voluntary personal care and assistance in the diet.
The palliative care is then used when there are no other options.
In order to make the deaths more comfortable.
In Quebec, 11.700 residents on a bed for palliative care.
That is very little, considering that one day we all will die.
This is the life in the best possible conditions continue, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It grants the wishes of a dying depending on Mundpflege with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need their Blutzuckerspiegel no longer control.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we have X a beer served during the night has died.
This morning, his son the beer at the feet of the deceased austrinken.
“We help relatives and patients alike,” said Nathalie Pflegedirektorin Savard.
In the home-Victor Gadbois is not a day as the other.
In addition to an old man from 93 years ago, which is the last in the courtyard Familienzusammenkunft enjoys and well supported by his pillow, but his motion, dies in honour of a young man from 36 years ago by his parents, his wife and his two small children is surrounded, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years of evidence,” Dr. Christiane shares with Martel worries.
53% of the home-Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their Wohnstätte, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i. e. a care to ease the suffering of patients, if they have reached the last stages of their lives, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And a number of organizations, such as the home-Victor Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize in more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
These very serious shortcoming in the care of Quebec ensures that several of them in the palliative care specialist doctors, the adoption of a law on euthanasia and suicide assistiertem with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto circulated by prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed to its objection to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec, the health system is not effective enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care before it is accepted, to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with severe pain in the emergency room was without measures to alleviate has taken.
I am afraid that the patients just want to die because they lack adequate health care.
And, at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst forecasts fought until the last day.
The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, as they broke off a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin that I will stop the treatment, she replied that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told them.
However, she had told me that I was in the end.
Not omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, to thank the staff that this desire is not granted, after their pain eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that the palliative care in Schmerzbehandlung not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, head of the society of the palliative care home palliative care Greater Montreal talk about 8% of patients on a Schmerzbehandlung.
At the very end of life, the doctors so often on the terminale Sedierung back, leading to the patients either sporadic or permanently until the time of his death einzuschläfern.
We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief, increasingly have the possibility to these terminale Sedierung resort.
Patients, the pain will not be eased, all say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that does not necessarily mean, “I want you to put to me,” but, “I would like to see my pain.”
The implementation of this report was made possible because of a canadian Journalismusstipendiums Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute.
