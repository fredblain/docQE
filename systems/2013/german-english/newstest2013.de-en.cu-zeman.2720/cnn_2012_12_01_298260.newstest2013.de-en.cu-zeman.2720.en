Mexico-my american identity crisis.
Many people were due to the lack of opportunities, forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to the emigrants to accuse-they are calling them hard times into memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was in the passport arrived than bewilderment in me wide.
Signs pointed to two queues, one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”), the other for “Extranjeros” (“foreigners”).
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure what to me to go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up all my life and was “Mexicans”.
An ethnic-acronym, just as my friends in Boston “irish” or my friends in New York “Italians.”
Later, I opted for “Mexico-american.”
But this one was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's, there was no need for acronyms or put.
I was just Americans.
I speak spanish well enough, at least, to me in this language at both ends to an interview to claim.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my american accent, I will also do not go ahead.
So I took my american passport, and found myself in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all those subjects you expected if the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the mexican economy, which it is one reason that Mexicans today with equally likely to remain in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to be with the United States and Canada side and a north american trading bloc modeled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed that Mexico's war against the drug cartels to continue, although he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasting a single to the United States in 1848, in Mexico, the country's leadership under vorgehaltenem gun, forced them to more than half its territory to leave.
But for Mexicans in centuries and not in minutes, are memories of this event is not to be overlooked.
Therefore, once a US Treasury official also only mildest criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the mexican press and among the elite of the country-complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children Montezumas sink on the war-path.
And yet, the greatest challenge in Mexico's truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Interested resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of mexican descent in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree of a person, perhaps a parent or Großelternteil-no chance in Mexico to shy and immigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile-brown-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of the people, and our allegiance to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now have to live the american dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the american dream is that we live-not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred, sometimes, perhaps, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of Mexico's ruling class do not like.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument of a humiliating defeat and look at us, because we do not have enough Mexico.
Our spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, is a symbol of the failure of our existence.
If our families in Mexico had failed, they would not have gone.
And then we would not now see Seidenvorhang caught-behind with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally in the United States einwanderte, I am reminded that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans there are tensions because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are, and Mexican-Americans take them so badly.
While US citizen, has seen itself as a part of two countries.
But many mexican Americans, I know, have the feeling that neither one nor the other country to belong.
We love the mexican band los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we as Americans saw it.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I would learn during my trip, is there anything that this relationship is more complicated: some parts of the mexican leaders and their links to the diaspora Bildungsbürgertums would resume.
You want to mexican Americans as a provisional “ambassador” for Mexico, their interests in the United States.
We should have our american colleagues, telling them how great a visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership, their ties to Mexico to step up.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, rampant corruption and the Drogengewalt, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid there you need alone, cronies.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some mexican Americans harbour a grudge for how their family members until not so long ago were treated.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are “mexican” than I thought.
