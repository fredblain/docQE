The Higgs Boson analysed
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs-Bosons last summer, a certain amount of consternation, and for good reason.
It is thought that in fact, this Boson in nothing less than the mechanism for the mass of all the objects in the universe is responsible.
And finally, this is the final piece of the Standard Model, the existence of our best-or “least bad” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter-predicted, but still not empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a real new particles, and that the Higgs Boson predicted by the Standard Model strongly resembles.
Moreover, that seems to be confirmed by new data this week at a big physics-Congress in Kyoto were presented, but it still missing data about completely safe.
Nevertheless, we believe that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk, to deceive, and let us see what is at stake.
In this world, there is inevitably a crucial law, which means that two objects, not at the same time in the same place may be present.
It is not possible, against this rule to breach and you try not to, as you will hurt.
Because even if the particle really is a strange world, it turns out that, for them, such a law also applies: the Pauli's Ausschlussprinzip, which says that two particles do not have the same room at the same time if they are unable to fill in the same “Quantenzustand”, with a “state”, by and large, from some of its properties.
Assuming the particle physicists share in two categories.
In one corner, the good citizens of the Fermione be described as polite and Pauli-the principle.
And in the other the Bosonen, a nasty bunch of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that, in fact, they are at the same time in the same place.
These Bosonen are based, according to the website of the Particle adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: the Mesonen here, we will not be dealing with and the “Kraftteilchen”, through which the great forces of nature and spread of the Higgs Boson somehow would be used.
It must be emphasised, however, that not all these Bosonen such exotic creatures are, as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle of, then it is only thanks to a Bosons banality of exceptional: the Photon, or the “Lichtteilchen”, “the messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical load faster or change the direction, the electromagnetic field exactly in this place “disrupted”, such as a pebble in a pond was thrown.
By this “disturbance” created an electromagnetic wave, infra-red light (or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a Photon and therefore one of the “Bosonen carriers of the force”.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, “disrupted” that must be the Boson shows.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the magnetic field, the virus has to be very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be.
Why is a giant like CERN particle accelerators, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a total of 27 km, to such energy to achieve.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again to help the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd to explain.
There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all of the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, would never even a piece of paper from the fridge.
And, equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field, those that do have a mass, while the other (as, incidentally, the Photon) have no mass.
For what can all this research now “be good,” says Mrs Plamondon?
For the science, they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all variations between the observations and predictions of the SM to investigate.
There are, in fact, many physicists who eagerly hope that such departures, otherwise the slightest difference a door to open a “new physics” and the model could plug some holes.
It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the force of gravity (ups!) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the subject matter of the universe-ups (again!).
However, the CERN such deviations, until now, has not been found.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population is difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to think that we do not have.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs-not suspect that their work such a revolution would trigger.
You saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle-in the Bell Labs has worked, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 even the first Dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) has developed-said that the laser at the beginning, rather than a “Laborspielerei” was considered.
Imagine …
Moreover, applications from all the instruments, the research.
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the optics of a small Lichtsensor developed.
Although it is not the original purpose was to serve this sensor today all digital cameras around the world as the “eye” and gave him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our lives, but it means that you really can never know …
