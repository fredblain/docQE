A daily drink butter and 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan reach many people, a biblical ripe old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A Spurensuche in the country in which 97-year-olds still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan reach many people, a biblical ripe old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A Spurensuche in the country in which 97-year-olds still comparatively young.
The journey through the mountains is Talysch wildromantisch.
The minibus rumpelt kurvenreiche on the street, past densely wooded hills, rivers and simple reißenden Bauernhäusern.
Everything is green and saftig, one could argue that it would have been, in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of the border with Azerbaijan, Iran is only a few miles away.
Here is living the caucasian ethnic group the Talyschen that not much is known, other than that they were perfect and speaks persian Aserisch and long lasting.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small city flaunts to wuchtig architecture out of soviet times, which is not in the picturesque landscape fit.
Tourists come here, hardly onerous to the Azerbaijani capital of Baku.
Of the 323 miles you need eight hours because the roads only einspurig.
The enormous wealth that the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is here in the province has still not arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the stuff to the tourist attraction.
“Baku in May with the Eurovision Song-festival famous, and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from documented older than 100 Fatulayeva. shows a black-and-white photograph.
Here is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years ago was fathered a child
But the museum is the controversial star shepherd Şirali Müslümov, of the 168 years old.
A birth certificate, however, there is not.
And given the oldest documented people, of the 122 years old, seems Müslümovs age but highly dubious.
“1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973,” explained Fatulayeva.
The man was three times married and have 23 children, ranging in age from 136 years, he is still a daughter conceived.
Has Şirali Müslümov so his age for a couple of decades for it?
But Rembrandt Altersforscher Scholz, the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, by the very elderly in Central Asia.
“Many people Auffallend hochaltrige also exists in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “also in Sardinia live lots of very old men.”
Because of a lack of documentation, however, no scientific evidence about age, especially as register lacked.
Every day becherweise geschmolzene butter
The fact is, though, that the people of the region around a remarkably often Lerik biblisches age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100 years.
So why live here in the south so many Hochbetagte?
The Azeri Farid Mugimzadeh tour guide explained that with the specific genes Talyschen.
Museumsdirektorin Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that the diet is.
But that it is the stuff of kalorienreiche Talyschen so healthy meat, bread and milk, in particular, love and many of which daily geschmolzene drink a glass of butter, seems from a nutritional point not just plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people in Cengemiran?, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, live Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years it has been to this region still comparatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have offspring, 143, lives in a simple Holzhaus, typical of the whole of the Caucasus region.
It sits on the ground with a Butterfass they tirelessly and herrollt.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen to prepare the tea, the guests in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu-glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in reih link, and under her headscarf hiding it for a long time, dunkelblonde Zöpfe, her son with pride about our reveals.
I have my hair is washed with milk, and I never kept their colours.
“I have never used shampoo,” says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always just ate what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not a single time in the supermarket to buy food.
They then told by her husband, who was in the army.
The worst of it was in the period following the Second World War.
But everything was better than the “beloved father” Heydar Aliyew took power.
The propaganda sounds strange coming from an old woman.
But the cult of the Vaterfigur the nation will be driven to the country as a dictator, has almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan elderly.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros) a month as a pension, receives Mirzayeva here, an amount that you can live well.
And perhaps even Mirzayevas long ergrauter son right: “the old enjoy respect in our culture.”
You live in the middle of the extended family, to be loved, and umsorgt are happy.
If that is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive
