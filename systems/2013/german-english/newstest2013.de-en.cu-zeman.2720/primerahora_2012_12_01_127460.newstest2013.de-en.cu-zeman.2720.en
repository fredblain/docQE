Héctor “Hetin” Reyes: “basketball was my life.”
The Weltenbummler of Basketballs, Héctor “Hetin” Reyes, was the Korbsport for more than 60 years and has around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of intellectual history of the country as “Basketballs Héctor Hetin Reyes.”
Before he by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, be it as a player of lower classes, player of the first National League, agent and head of the BSN with the President or the Vaqueros de Bayamón Basketballverbands.
“My whole life I have many basketball donned hats, indeed, several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and President of the Union was in the 1990s,” recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he met his wife, Isabel, trusted for more than 50 years, lives.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes is exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all with photographs and memories of his long career decorated and they show.
In the heart of Bayamón
The emotionalsten memories are those of his time in the Vaqueros of the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, remember where his 15-year anniversary as manager of the club or Mitgeschäftsführer celebrated.
“These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of the Vaqueros eight championships since 1967 as a manager or coach, Mitgeschäftsführer be allowed.
It was rewarding for many years, including five finals in succession from 1971-1975.
And then I said with a championship in 1981, the year of the Debüts Jerome Mincy to BSN.
From then took “Cuco” Ortiz, who is a very good manager,” says Reyes.
I remember that my genes Bartow, here as coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: “I have a very strong and 2 metres in great players.
Would you use it?”
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow recommended then Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, acquire and one of our best Werfer was.
I know, even as he said that, if a championship for Mincy Bayamon Gausse, allowing for another.
The championship with the Vaqueros Gausse he was granted, but even from a distance because, in 1988, he is already at the top of the association.
At this time it is, and the executions of Mincy to enjoy in the national team.
I remember when we first vorolympischen at the tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, on the fourth documented bronze, which really should have been, if not this canadian referee would have been the last of us Spielzug repeat for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the World Cup in 1990, the best team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who used the Olympics in 2004 against the dream team won.
My favorite, however, is the team of the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won the team gold and the United States offered a fight, as when it against us in the World Cup bronze won.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz) once again, but also the young players (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the brothers Francisco and León (Edgar) and Mario Morales, the “Quixote” because of a 1990 Knieverletzung could not be present.
A team which, perhaps, in terms of personality, not the best, but we won a gold medal and the us great joy, was the tournament's 1995 vorolympischen in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blockage of players because of the events in the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, despite every prediction, we won the gold medal.
Who was the best player from Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without his career in different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coach as Julio Toro, Patents Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Armandito Dalmau, Torres.
Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you believe is the best of what you have achieved in the club?
I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things that I would have imposed, e. g. the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The boys in Ponce, for example, only in their area, and only in the Playoffs on national teams from other corners of the island.
Today, many of the children unnecessary travel and games.
At least, I see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches, table-officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you do today?
I like to listen to music, see my time in music videos from YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and I can go to a Basketballspiel.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
