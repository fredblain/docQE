A republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies, with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center, the latter for a myth, it confirmed that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by the strikes.
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the US, moreover, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US states for the conduct of elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of american governments since 2009, new laws announced that the procedures for the registration or the ballot difficult.
This phenomenon has after the elections in November 2010, in which new 675 republican officials in 26 states has been registered.
As a result, 180 bills introduced in 2011 alone, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters a Lichtbildausweis and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws that also shortened the period for early voting, the right declared invalid, as voters to register on Election Day, and citizens denied the right to vote, for which a Gerichtsakte.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state of the electorate wants a Lichtbildausweis can boast.
Indiana is the first state that such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law in Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to this practice in other states.
Over the last two years promoting it in 34 states, bills with which voters are forced to produce a Lichtbildausweis.
It is important to note that the US citizens in contrast to Quebec is not on the cards as a universal health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i. e. no vocal 21 million people from a government agency issued Lichtbildausweis their state.
Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012 does not have such a card.
There are, however, often more than a hundred dollars to pay the required ID.
The new restrictions are young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of african-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the necessary Lichtbildausweis.
This goes further.
The students, who are seen as voters their voice more to democratic candidates, it is in a number of states do not allow their of their establishment Lichtbildausweis issued to use.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of Angel Jagdvereinen-or, more to the republican side to choose from these clubs issued cards for elections to use.
In 2004, a federal state of the voters asked for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state that such a requirement.
In 2011, a dozen states have passed laws, which voters demand that they prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at the hispanic votes to limit.
Because it is clear that two out of three hispanic voters to the Democratic Party.
In addition, republican legislators in 2011 in eight states laws, with the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
Also, you have the right of individuals and groups, those voters to provide support to the register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign for the registration of voters in the general election in 2004, helped to around 10 million citizens to register.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of recording Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%.
In addition, republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at the period for early voting.
For example, in the general election in 2008 in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance, african-Americans, even though it is only 13% of the voters in the state.
The same is true of the hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the white, 76% of voters, only 46% of the electorate who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic lawmakers and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
A number of bills have been through the veto of the democratic governors blocked.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened in the most controversial pieces of legislation.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states passed laws that require a Lichtbildausweises colleagues.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012, no doubt, the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws passed by and see them as a clear goal of influencing the outcome in key states for 2012.
A report from the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College, which are needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system would have a major impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States.
