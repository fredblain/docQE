Petronella Wyatt from Oxford: I was bullied because I am a Tory
Not only university students today will be attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream, a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother who had gone to university, I once Wissenstempel for most of the world, for a modern greek symposium that the great pillars of civilisation-free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my Worscester College in the late 1980s-there I had intended to study history, again-I had my suitcase and so the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
Recently in the Evening Standard, I was told I would be gone, because I have a problem with it, had students in neighbouring rooms in sex.
The author of A N Wilson said schelmisch, I would leave the university because I was forced to drink from cups, damaged.
But the truth was less amusing.
I walked away.
Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or from a private school because I was in.
I was bullied for one reason only-because of the alleged in this cradle of enlightenment so narrow and cruel seemed now: my late father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I have been an advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, current, reportedly suffering from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford, has now developed such dimensions, that a group of them last week, the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz requested, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the junior common room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College say they will, because of their political views “often actively isolated, attacked personally and for undesirable,” said.
They call for a place in their Gleichberechtigungskomitee College, in order to ensure that their opinions are freely expressed.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent Abandoned documentation on political students on BBC Two, “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right,” the Tories as eccentrics and neo-nazis.
It has been demonstrated, among other things, a graduate of Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association student in a Rolls-Royce and went with silberfarbenem silberbesetztem protzte suit and cane.
Conservative students at other universities say that they are “scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees”.
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the conservative student movement of the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper said: “there is a growing Linkstendenz in universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon club, without us even to know.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christi, which initiated the request for greater protection, is of the view that such a climate is “unpleasant”. the 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect of the conservative student association of Oxford says that it has in JCR-members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
“This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and the welfare of members”, she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was part of a minority.
As an incredibly tentative 18-year-olds, I was in September 1986.
The hatred of the conservative party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university in favour of Margaret Thatcher-a former student, because of cuts in higher education is no title of honour.
The atmosphere would have even stalinists squirm.
In the first days of the first week of the new students and the Tutoren to know, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the Tutoren the mockery of Tory students not only tolerate, but also happily take part.
Political issues such as the Bergarbeiterstreik, privatisation and the rejection of the Government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa, found their way into the rooms of the holzgetäfelten Tutoriums.
When I first started these events should I french texts from the 18th century translated into English. on what it should be, I was not taken.
“Miss,” Wyatt said the tutor Harry Pitt died (now), “please translate the first paragraph”.
I came here.
Pitt was a small man with a face as from Kuchenteig, and quite unpleasant.
“Weigern is Thatcher, french supporters to learn, or are they simply stupid?” he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
“I propose that in your leisure time, a few Französischstunden-so if you do too much with their social activities are employed,” Pitt knurrte me.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
That evening, I sat at the College alone at dinner, when someone easy on the shoulder tippte.
It was a Englischstudent from the second year called James, who is a member of the conservative student association.
“I know who you are,” he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is the way it is.
Anyone suspected of Tory to be harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most of the incoming Tory claim, members of the Labour Party to be.
In a local pub later, I tried to block me.
I insisted that I cannot in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher's views.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
An incoming in philosophy, politics and economics, the irony is that as a conservative force in Eton College visited, said to me: “you are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins.”
You are dirty.
Other students who shared his views.
I was perverse and bad way.
“The tories have sex?” asked me one.
The beat each other, right?
I felt, as homosexuals from the more liberal legislation of the United States may have felt.
Would I ever get to Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would like only after dark can make?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclination to suppress it?
The three years before me were spread before my intellectual eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who is openly as Tory was was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which has its headquarters in my college.
He was not only for it to be hated, a conservative, but also because it Thatcher at foreign policy advice and wrote speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place it was small-minded and provincial, rejected him for his marxist-deterministische Geschichtsperspektive.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
“You will not be happy,” he told me.
I began, between Oxford and the house my parents commute and found refuge in more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated, Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed in disbelief.
During his time in the vierzigern all political views were accepted.
“But it is the best place in the world,” he said sheepishly.
Something they would never do that, not in my city of träumenden Turmspitzen.
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners.
His wet eyes tarnished.
Give it a chance.
I am sure someone neckt you only.
It would break my heart if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakening.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, the pressure to renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums during the following week, in which another Geschichtstutor seriously had claimed that I was “an enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I made that my parents had been subjected to “a brainwashing”, and called it “silly old.”
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, which is the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career beating.
At the time he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid me in my room, and after five minutes gave my Häscher.
As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Like you can call me a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But no 18-year-olds should ever at a school in spite of such intimidation and have to suffer.
And it is even more tragic is that it was an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory originated, but far behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought in hiding.
