Singapore needs the economy to save babies
The Singapurer doing that they do not have children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and bringing up children.
“The population of Singapore has to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife, we are fulfilling our patriotic period and we create our lives!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons but, nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viralen video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a Rapper-song, the local sayings such as “pushing is a “bao (loaf”) in the foot, through the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, the video has spun preserves the hope that the advert on entertaining way, to draw attention to the problem.
Your creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of the music that people wanted to get a “national duty”.
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The Fortpflanzen, we are the worst in the world, which is why we have said that this is an issue that we have had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the sale of perfume with Pheromonen or the organisation of speed-dating evenings (quick flirtation).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success.
So we thought: why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, such as a rap to komponieren?
1.2 children
Who is this issue does not easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year they 1,300 US dollars for political measures to encourage more people to have children.
A package of government for married couples and parents grants of up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But it has had little success.
Singapore is a hi-tech, wealthy city-state in south-east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known.
According to its national Bevölkerungsbehörde, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the rate was about 2-what is known as Ersetzungsrate-was in 1976.
So why not get the Singapurer more children?
Wei Ming Tan, director for marriage and family policy of national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this is a “better education” and “greater career”.
“This has been possible for people, except to marry and have a family to provide more options in terms of life goals and to have to set priorities,” she said.
These changes in the social realities of the higher number of people living alone and the delay in the marriage and birth contributed to the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that has led to a surge in migration, the reduction of the population, resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites, where the little covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who criticised the low wages and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the governing party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since independence.
Since the election was an attempt, the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers to correct.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on the growth of one nation, tax revenues, the health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore, unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small houses to be built.
It has already, impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started, the number of small Appartements control as “Schuhschachteln” are known and in certain areas of the city build.
These have a Wohnfläche Appartements of 46 square metres and show a large Verkaufserfolg.
However, the concern is that they can promote the lifestyles of the people living alone, and that it deters large construction firms, to build housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the EL Immobilienfirma Developers, says that his “Schuhschachteln” much more quickly than larger housing units will sell.
They are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger housing units.
That lead them to our cash flow are a great deal better.
He is, however, that the new standards are the developers of clearer guidelines, which previously obstacles placed in the way they were, if too many small housing units in a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore, a city-state.
Even if these new rules of the road to a rise in the national birth rate could be the talks with the Singapurern in the City to work indicates that it will not have a major impact.
“The people are very stressed, housing and education is expensive, which is why many will be delayed,” says a young managers.
The other children can get.
“It is important for me about my own money and time to have another one,” says about 20-year-old man.
Men and women in their career, the stress and the cost of the property and education as the reasons why they are not able to have children.
Therefore the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can still do so much.
