“America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens,” says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, with “South America actually learn from Europe.”
Correa on 6. summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), participated in Lima, Peru, the state television said that the Europeans “in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing” and “almost a mother country.”
In this sense, he defended the project, a south american citizenship to create the Member States of the Unasur.
“Erreicht must be the free movement of citizens and workers in all latin american countries, as it already is in the Andean Community of the time, however, there is still a reactionary sectors which is aiming for a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reorganization of the Organisation of American States (OEA) below the target, the influence of the Anglo-saxon countries and those that take into account the agreement of San Jose on human rights have signed up.
Those who teach, pledge never to something and, in return, we sign the South Americans all the time.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter Commission for Human Rights, based in Washington, and will be financed by the United States,” he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted.
Correa said that he did not regret that decision because it will not have betrayed his principles, but his “deep democratic values and views on human rights” has fulfilled.
He added that it had been “well-founded suspicions that Assange be extradited to a third country and procedure was not respected.”
He also criticised the swedish justice system that requires him to have him on its territory because of an interrogation of alleged Sexualdelikts, while “the swedish jurisdiction it via a video conference, on the Embassy of Ecuador in London, may be carried out.”
Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental state of Assange would be disrupted.
“Since then he has been in our embassy, I have not talked to him, the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious,” said the head of state of Ecuador.
There is a danger, though, that he would take some physical and mental harm because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises outdoors could carry out.
“That would affect the health of every person,” he added.
Correa has said that the solution to the asylum, Assange since the month of June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was granted the granting of a Freibriefs which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe's. he stressed that there had been talks with London to resolve the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, the word we use for this case in that it does not have, though, continued talks.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a number of procedures at various european bodies”, he said.
“And if the UK licence granted this morning, I feel that this is finished.”
If Mr Assange in Sweden and the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogated on Skype, as the swedish case law allows and in other cases, is the problem.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to make itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he would not tolerate “the mediocrity, the sinister intention and the lie of the freedom of expression.”
“The worst enemies of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, journalists, but bad for profitability and blackmail,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador not more of such “journalists and not by the bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries dominated”, and, before that, when it comes to re-election a “the revolution will deepen the way forward in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to veto against Paraguay in the Unasur dating at least to maintain its next elections, arguing that the body must be “tough and not of opportunism and not as legally verkleideten coup d'état cannot accept,” because it “the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed.”
The President of Ecuador is also keeping the desire of his “other” Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling by the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua seerechtlichen privileged, with the borders between the two countries to negotiate for “absolutely right.”
Currently, this judgment is not implemented.
It is a problem between a south and a central american state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must in the pursuit of a common path to be overcome.
They must be fully treated so that they will be overcome and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that “it is right for Latin America, international bodies, if both countries pledge to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh.”
With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador in his third consecutive mandate to achieve, he admitted that he “that possibility with a lot of optimism and joy, though it is sometimes very difficult.”
Correa promised that if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such circumstances as unjust in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one that likely victory guaranteed, so I have this responsibility,” he said.
If I win, it would be my last period as President, then I retreat from public life.
This is also true when we lose.
“That has been decided,” he said.
Correa also took to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I was just with Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he planned, for a routine treatment went there, and that he expected that after the election campaign again travel to Cuba.
“It is in no way a relapse in the health of President Chavez,” he commented.
