The most difficult job in the world: the human pests from Kawah Ijen
For four of the euro, the winner of the indonesian volcano, their lives and their health at risk if they have 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 Minenarbeiter, their lives by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the indonesian island of Java.
He has every day, right down to the ground, where his Kraters rise from the earth ausströmende schwefelhaltige gas in contact with the air in tablets.
After great Schwefelsteine has fallen, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, transported them into two Bambuskörben on his shoulders on the slope of stone paths.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is up to a level of 2386 metres but the exhausted bodies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in Schildkrötentempo, while the balance and keep their steps must be careful to ensure that they do not slip and fall.
You know that every step of their lives can cost, as a french tourist happened years ago on the steep slopes of the Ijen Kawah plummeted.
The Minenarbeiter of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur, which reduce them.
Top arrived, they pave the path between the tourists, as Zirkusaffen taking photographs and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a Minengesellschaft a little further down a total of 1850 metres set
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (never better) said its workers, which they 662 indonesian rupees (5 cents) for every kilo of sulphur pays.
It sold them for 10,000 rupees (83 per cent) to the petrochemical industry, because of this mineral in everyday life is widespread and the manufacture of matches, Feuerwerksartikeln happening, cosmetics, and even the bleaching of sugar is used.
“As we normally 70 kg, we receive for each way around 000 rupees (3.8 euros),” says us Anto, usually three routes on the day.
For every line it needs three hours that he is fully managed, at the end of the day, however, he then 120,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What a lousy pay for such an almost superhuman effort looks, however, is three times as much of what he would earn in the fields.
“The Tagelohn Minenarbeiter here, where the Kaffeeernte 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on the day will be paid and the average monthly two million rupees ($167), is very high,” said the winner, who had previously as a builder on the tourist island of Bali was working.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason that in Indonesia, as important as the sulphur is: “I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have them to Java brought them to convert to Islam.”
Anto has asthma, coughs, often breathing with difficulty and his eyes are because of the poisonous gases irritably.
The 27-year-old Anto sets for three years of his life at the Ijen Kawah on the line, the sulphur to him before the first traces, though he has his face with a mask and Spezialbrille covers.
Anto has asthma, coughs, often breathing with difficulty and his eyes are because of the poisonous gases from the volcano irritably.
This is the price for reaching his dream, he must pay.
“I will be here two more years of work because I opened a shop or would like to learn spanish or french,” he promises, in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could be a tourist guides, waiters or reception at a hotel, but instead work he carried out the work of one Tragesels.
He shares a dirty Holzhütte with other agencies and is every morning at two o'clock at night, because the sulphur ausströmt, where his distinctive yellow paint bläulich shine in the darkness.
The shadow of challenging, it is rising in the light of a small Stirnlampe on his helmet, which he himself from his own money has bought into the crater.
Approximately 400 vehicles, on the Kraterboden baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the Minengesellschaft the mechanised Schwefelabbau not in order to cut costs, and gives the providers that are working on their own account and will be paid for by weight, no equipment.
You also get no benefit from the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this national park, along with the entrance fee of $15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists, the photography of the volcano and human Tragesel.
“This work is for the animals and not for the people” protested Madrusin, a stämmiger, 42-year-old, winner of the three decades since leaving school at Ijen Kawah works.
He is capable of up to 110 kg and assurances that he continues, “as long as it is”, because it had the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even if the sulphur's throat burns and eye jucken, when the wind suddenly turned around and the Minenarbeiter in the thick pillars einklemmt from the crater to intercept the men are so tough that no one complains about serious diseases … except, of course, the usual Arthrose, breathing problems, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, the weight of the baskets are distorted.
With the basket on his back, with his flowing Unainik 53 years in the position, 50 kg.
Every day, he and his allies break 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, from three trucks on a Ziegenpfad between complain to the camp in Tamansari in 18 miles away.
“I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano all my life,” explains Unainik, when he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth missing.
Of his five children working the grandfather with his 30 years as a sulphur-bearers.
Time passes, but the mediocrity, generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who as human Lastesel Ijen Kawah on work.
