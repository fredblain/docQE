Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico's President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant analyses of the challenges ahead of it and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City particularly badly.
Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which has sealed off several important transport routes into the capital and on the roads for chaos.
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching the Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the president connective and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons Mexico has become economically well off, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has cost over the past six years already 60,000 lives.
"My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," said Pena Nieto earlier this week in the Oval Office, the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this goal.
Before with the US president on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided over the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo, one remembers, for example, to him.
Residents of the resort to credit him with the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto, who represent a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that were once here.
With his name badges outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally 9th Gabriel Hernandez, who as Congressman Nietos Pena's party, the PRI works.
In particular, the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Member of Congress, 9th admits that the party is after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The allegations by the opposition, the new president's lack of substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, above all, but he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view on their former governor.
In Tlacopan, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast could be on the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo, not bigger.
The place is hidden under highway bridges and, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military has been called in to fight the drug gangs operating in those areas, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a corner fallow land near a large landfill, the bodies were alone in the last two years left stele murdered women.
During the term of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico about 1,000 women - a statistic that is itself the city of Ciudad Juarez exceeds that for their violence and the notorious killings of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he has addressed the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least not adequately.
But, in the worst case, his government have closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete, typical of the derelict district, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me pictures of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of events, according to Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the bodies had already been fixed.
While her mother tells her story, an image of Mariana looks down from the wall. It is placed next to a cross, which bears a single word: Justice.
But exactly this, so the family, you have denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me when I was a Schwätzerin, troubler, Nörglerin.
You want to accept their verdict simply and shut up.
"But that is not possible, if so many flaws and omissions were there," she says.
If President Pena Nieto, on Saturday, the president of binding, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to care during his tenure, especially around this problem.
"I hope that as president, he is as he was as a governor," said the PRI-Congressman 9th in Valle del Bravo.
But, just before the families of the victims in Ciudad neza fear most.
