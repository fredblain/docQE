A Republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans to justify its policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center for the latter holds a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States as the number of people killed by lightning strike.
The lawyers of the Republicans have recorded in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: These new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States.
Unlike Canada are the US states for the conduct of elections in the Member States.
In this sense, the majority of the American government has announced since 2009, new laws that make the process for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has gained after the elections in November 2010 in importance, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states have been recorded.
As a result, 180 bills have been introduced in 2011 that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that the voter photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship present.
Moreover, the periods for the early vote shortened, declared invalid for the right to register as voters on election day, and citizens through these laws also denied the right to vote, for which there is a court acts.
Before the elections of 2006 has no US state of the voters required to show photo identification.
Indiana was the first state, who has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other states.
Over the last two years, they fostered in 34 states of draft legislation that voters are forced to produce photo identification.
It is important to note that the US citizens, unlike Quebec does not have a universal identification card as the health insurance card.
In fact, with 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters people not by a government authority of their state-issued photo identification.
In addition, five million in 2012 Neuwähler do not have such a card.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often required to pay to obtain the required identification.
The new restrictions on young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected.
Indeed, with 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years, do not have the required photo identification.
This goes further.
The students, who are regarded as voters who cast their votes more for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their of their establishment issued photo identification.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs that stronger for the Republican side choose to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
In 2004, no state has asked for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, which introduced such a requirement.
In 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their U.S. citizenship.
Clearly, these measures aim to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states, with which the registration of voters was abolished on election day.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups limited to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have to register voters in the general election in 2004 helped to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 has decreased compared to 2006 by 17%.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states have adopted laws that seek to shorten the period for early voting.
For example, in the general election in 2008 were in Florida, 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, while only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same is true for the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who constituted 76% of voters accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, have opposed the Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously passing laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require showing a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim of influencing the results in the decisive state for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws, account for 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes in the electoral system, the legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: These new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the democratic system in the United States.
