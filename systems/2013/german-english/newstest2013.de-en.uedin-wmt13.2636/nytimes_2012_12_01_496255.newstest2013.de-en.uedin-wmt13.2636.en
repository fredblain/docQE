In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in southeast Colorado for a crime to justice in this state will soon be legal: The possession of a few chunk of marijuana and a pipe with which he smoked it.
Orozco said that he and some friends were in a car with it in Lamar, near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car had been Orozco for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia, summoned excusable peccadilloes, each with a penalty of $100 are provided - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But he is also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use to legalise the answer in hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less by the law than from the site.
Hundreds of offences that revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures have already been dropped.
The police authorities pursue adults over 21 years ago no longer for possession on a small scale, which is allowed by law, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced that existing marijuana offences and pursue quote people still in court.
At the same time, several cities vote, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so rapidly that it is hard to know what will happen next," Daniel J. door, the police chief in Aurora says that lies east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington scratch perplex me on the head.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of December 1, 2013.
In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that Colorado is in any case, most states ahead of what the regulation of marijuana subject, where the drug was only for medical purposes and then legalized for personal consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, the state is therefore good for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Insurance spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith admits that there is no place or system can do more than to serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent, which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and is thus the end point of a grey area in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the legalized possession.
And unpleasant practice issues need to be resolved at this time - about how the government target of a "reasonable access" to lizenziertem marijuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere, it will be difficult to find a location for licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal says cannabis, "a recently formed research group.
On 21 November Chief door sent its employees in Aurora, an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would be minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years no longer track, and that the police "immediately" no prosecutions for such offences will strive for.
Chief door added that the police will continue to enforce urban targets for regulation of growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue to be persecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado district prosecutor Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he stated that his administration would pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people need to be in possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana successfully prosecuted, although many have been prosecuted for other crimes.
"Our agency has a duty to pursue violations, where it was the obligation of crimes," Buck said, in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the country, shows the possession of small quantities of adults no longer.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported that decision, but also decided to drop all outstanding possession proceedings.
"I do not think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it is changed," he says.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was already clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions in the whole state fostered among local officials a profound dilemma regarding the big green experiment.
District prosecutors when it was "a" cultural barrier, Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver said, for marijuana offences representing the defendants in court and on the ground, a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws for acts.
"They have had such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for criminal that they can accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states, the small amounts of marijuana like alcohol treatment, Colorado and Washington as a national sample cases are traded for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervous on instructions from the federal government, which wants to sell and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level, continues to be treated as a crime.
Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Justice Department is backing down.
Despite the arrests of several special medical marijuana users and sellers, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states largely.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that investigators have no doors are likely to occur in small quantities of drugs for seizures, but is likely to be reluctant, under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops to tolerate.
Several cities in Colorado are not only that the federal authorities act.
Even before the election day, some local community administrations approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, even though it only opened in about a year ago.
Last week, Montrose, a town in the West decided to a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone at the federal level, and then face a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against the change in the law.
We have done this, for what the community has decided not to follow, which has opted for the state.
There are still many questions remain.
