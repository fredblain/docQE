"Valentino has elegance of the celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino, master of couture," which opened this week in London, talking with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian Modemachers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This is the designer at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture" has acknowledged a grandiose retrospective, for which more than 130 haute couture dresses were compiled created by its "Maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says, with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the completion of a story, whose sole protagonist "il signore" Garavani, which can be written but not without its arduous task clientele.
Valentino had always been fascination for the stifling and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, will be able to see, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the choicest aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England, and Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows that personal memories as a trophy of his social ascent from humble fashion-maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy on the idol of the international jet.
To be in love in the nobility, is not necessarily a disadvantage.
"At least they are not their stubs on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from the pop music are doing," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant hosts.
"We were all of us, if we were invited to his house in Gstaad," the ex-wife of "tired" Thyssen explains chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also, the Argentine model Valeria Mazza forgets the charisma of the Modemachers.
Many years ago, we went for a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music recognized and it felt his influence.
"All invitees feel important and loved," recalls the "Top Model" that her career in the haute couture week in Paris began in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion, because his designs are works of art," she says finally.
The fashion show of
The lives of Garavani is not a history of, of mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been turned into a glorious and 60-meter-long runway, which proposes a role reversal: The user takes the place of the model and the catwalk along to admire a beautiful "audience," which masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes, the Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a coat made of wool and leather, the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls with names like the Sibilla de..., Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sof√≠a von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion-maker, 2006
Many of those customers say the first Valentino is unforgettable as the first love, "."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection in 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him, Naty Abascal, one of the muses of designer says.
"I prefer him all the other because of his great love for the women and because it highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors, which he uses very; they have a lot of light and underscore the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leaders in the fashion Patricia Della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can remember the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of the age and the opportunity to have one of his evening clothes to wear.
In the late 1990s, it finally came.
I bought my first Valentino-dress for a party in my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a wooden top with a plunging V-neckline that makes the name.
"It was a dream come true, the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg says.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian Aristokratin, who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d'Arenberg to preserve their evening dresses of Modemachers "with the utmost care," "because a dress is a dress, but also the associated memories."
The "king" of the fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion-maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with pearls, 12 different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-metre-long tail.
According to the journalist, other passing fads, the supreme authority of the press as a milestone in the Haute Couture, was this dress at the end of the 20th century, "return to the customers of the top society."
For years, with the "savoir-being" of the elite marred, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates so many honors, as each of the husbands of its customers.
"I have always been struck by his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect exterior," d'Arenberg admits.
I saw him the last time a month ago, at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And it says a princess.
