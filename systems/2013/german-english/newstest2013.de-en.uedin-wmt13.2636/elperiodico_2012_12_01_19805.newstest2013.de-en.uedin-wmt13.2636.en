Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people to move, it must be understood that the purpose of the social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; with the release of these pages, but the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants" these concepts to explain the phenomenon has evolved.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants, they should teach, where we learn even more," he says.
He says that this is a complex issue, "because we demand of them that they have a defined criteria about what is, or should be, and that in an age where the maturity is not enough."
"They should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be loved to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.

"To tell you, they should not do it," he says.
Porras calls some possibilities: There are things that you would not tell a stranger. "Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, if you like it, when it published a photo of you, as it was released from a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
Have you asked for permission before the other people, if you have labelled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Must all know what you're doing at any moment?
