Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events such a hope seems to nip in the bud.
Amid the usual blame countless buildings were turned into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time rockets from Gaza are taken near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally find their end.
A war that is neither lost nor gained
At first glance, optimism in the face of the current situation seems appropriate anything but.
Even if the ceasefire holds on 21 November agreed that this week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group had to record major losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the most desperate and densely populated corners of the planet spent together, it is Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, gains Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
So, as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and rich friends can draw on their side.
Turkey, a revival of regional power that was once seen as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent forms - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels an increasingly more Islamist-style Stürzung Bashar Assad's regime before it could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the largest population and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt 2011 until his overthrow 30 years, had left little time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders even more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas may prove to be a player who can be excluded even from Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is not a threat.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome," has been able to work, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep peacefully.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remain steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest violence escalations.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004, about 30 Israelis have been killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers remained, not least thanks to the security wall in the West Bank, and thus the bulk of an eventual Palestinian state will be that protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared for international law, but still further.
Netanyahu is good. His Likud Party is ahead of the elections on January 22, led by Avigdor Lieberman still struggles with a previous group allied RISC.
Why is this nanny behind cunning Palestinians and handed them their own state?
If they had, in fact, control of the West Bank, they would not like their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip, including firing missiles?
No, it is better to keep and punish them behind the wall in chess, they should dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to win, but the Arab spring could make them a dash through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries in power have little left for Israel, they will focus first on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab governments hardly in the overhaul of its economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Morsi teamed with Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long-term. "
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians are still being deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that undoubtedly will explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded this week in Tel Aviv.
The repression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years, increasing its diplomatic tribute.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The right answer to those who are from the more sensible representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper: Two states, Israel granted for security purposes.
The - for the near future, the hope is that the cease-fire outside grants more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now work with Turkey and Qatar, the supply of arms to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem to convince.
Outsiders Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
It would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama needs to do its share to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems that he would be as a reluctant participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
