Share of legal weapons to extremely low crime
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of the arms bill for private gun owners.
Thus, the authorities are responding to recent events: Injured in shootings at weddings, and seven people were killed in the rampage of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri him.
The police to the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and ban the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years to raise.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma Committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes to the weapons law shortly before the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems through "attraction of the screws."
In an open letter was published, the author, representatives of various weapons associations demand - from the authorities to take "senseless" tightened up.
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the have, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes were recorded with application of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousands of crimes.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From the factories to the officers
The weapons come across multiple channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.

The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were both of the Russian officers as stolen the Kaukasiern itself," Baranez says.
On the second channel illegal weapons that are stolen vigilante of criminals.
Baranez explains that there are weapons that were stolen from the arms of both chambers of the police force and directly from employees of the law enforcement authorities.
Further illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals.
Many military camps, there was frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that it was arson, in some cases in order to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military personnel.
Make a contribution to the black market, according to Baranez the arms manufacturers.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that meet the international competition and therefore not under the hand of the weapons on the black market, in Moscow, frittered away," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a mafia, which organizes the smuggling," explains the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels has roughly in the delivery of the black market in illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report from the centre was posted for problem analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Interior Ministry and the Federal State Statistics Service, American literature and publicly available data on portals on the issue of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators from the army and law-enforcement authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market "had arrived there by the" guilt by leaders who have to do their work with weapons, the report says.
The data, the researchers found that 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% of thefts of weapons production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A sales manager of a weapons store, which does not want to be named, assured that weapons found during illegal excavations buys long no one, because they are out of date.
According to him, it is more likely that traders to buy the supplies in a weapons cache.
An Ensign is bought a weapon, for example, a gun type TT.
The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence.
"The trader brings the weapon into the city, and it sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police know about everything and know that if they can keep to the plan for the detection of crime, periodically checks on purchases by traders who offer illegal weapons," adds the sales consultants.
"As in the luxury goods"
Buyers and sellers to find each other most about friends.
I had seen websites and blogs, when someone was to come to me, and I proposed at "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me, that would bring myself to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.

There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code as "by Ivan treasure, which makes gear that the daughter lost a tooth."
I am now even to some dusters on an acquaintance whom I trust.
He gives me the dusters also only because he knows that I verpfeife him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.

According to the buyer gets Baranez not a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I just don't buy, but ride with the seller in the forest, and there we have a target.
"I can shoot it there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot we negotiate with each other," the expert, describes the action.
