"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season with PSG, you have taken on a new dimension.
How do you explain this progress?
Can you explain him through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff has given me too much.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my game.
And in a game, it is even easier.
In football, everything goes very quickly.
But I do not break out in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my game time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
You have the advantage of competing introduced by Carlo Jeff...
The new entrants this summer are accustomed to carry games very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me want to offer the forehead and give his best.
Moreover, Carlo Jeff gives me a lot in terms of my game.
He is co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Jeffs is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Jeff gives all the technicians respect.
The Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from an injury.
The trust he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the top rider.
But we lurk in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We qualified in this way for the first knockout round.
What is the purpose of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as much as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we are against very good European teams have a say about our word.
First of all, we want to be first in our group in Porto, so that we can carry out the return leg of the eighth and final home game.
In the short term, the PSG can be a major European club?
He has already been the budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is the means to ensure that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really concerned; this title.
In the last season, we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally, it should be with 79 points champion.
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux is contending for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
That the media are expecting too much from the PSG think?
In view of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot of us is expected.
We accept that completely.
However, if we were in a home game against Troyes 4-0 win, and it still is something that you can accuse us, this is certainly a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
Look at Manchester City, an association of creates for two seasons, failed to qualify for the first knockout round, and who has also made huge expenditure.
In terms of the amount you invested thought to break with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be left out of the equation.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were from this new PSG "geboostet."
That the Ligue 1 is exciting shows.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that we have won it, despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better that one by one "that dependence" talks.
This means that Inter is powerful and many goals shoots.
That is why he has come and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This is an incentive for others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the world's best defenders, it also allows all others to make progress.
You have seen how the European Championships in 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I was anxious to take part in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me to squeeze a little game time.
I saw things, from which I am emerged stronger.
Today, I will be able to realize good games in the national team.
This was my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and now we have to set an example.
What are your views "on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the" Bleus?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strictly, which is close to the players and stimulates the victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make no comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal, he had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
The questions on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1: 1) is a prelude game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
