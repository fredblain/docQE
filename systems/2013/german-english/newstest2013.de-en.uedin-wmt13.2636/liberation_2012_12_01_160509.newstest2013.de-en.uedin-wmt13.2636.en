A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed while Morsi.
While Egypt regarding the constitutional declaration that grants him temporarily the unlimited authority, more than ever, it remains divided, he decided to go for broke.
To the surprise of everyone he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day in its final version.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt is now for almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has provided only for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium," when he breaks his word "to" and "the law tramples."
On the part of his supporters, it assures that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
Within 14 days, a referendum should be held.
In a very short period of time, which forces the brothers to abandon their plan to declare the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest rages across the country.
After affirmed in an interview with the American newsreel Time Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
As an ultimatum is the Egyptian people with that resorting to a hasty vote asked her for votes: "Either I keep my draft or the unlimited authority," the latter should take after the adoption of the constitution, supposedly to an end.
85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned away because they believe that they have not been able to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted alike.
To help achieve the quorum yesterday morning in a hurry were added 11 people, deputy members.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted mostly unanimously.
Moreover, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of the day... the time has come for the prayer, because some members of the panel were of the opinion that the convent of the Constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text, which has been adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all the attention is, after all, identical to that of the 1971 constitution and says that the principles of sharia are the main source of law. "
The salafi parties, which is the establishment of Islamic law, a key demand had hoped, "to replace the principles" by "the rules," which would have a stronger application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article was not changed, a demonstration of their good will and their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" reciprocate the liberals, who see it as a propaganda blow.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution on other items.
At the same time, they have especially Article 220 in the eye of the University of Al-Azhar gives an advisory role, particularly with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "elected the people who will be asked to give its opinion, and not have any democratic legitimacy.
You can see this is the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals are also fed by the fact that the next chancellor of the university is likely to be far less moderate than the present.
"At present, no specific religious commitment is to recognize.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text, no Ulema, but academics who have been trained on the part of the French system, "Alexis Blouet, who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitution Transition appeased.
He admits, however, that "an ambiguity can in terms of Article 220, because the terms are lent the religious vocabulary.
One relates here, especially in the "Sunni" [Islamic jurisprudence, in Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of whether civilian judges are qualified to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday will be severely criticized because of the far-reaching powers that it grants the president of the republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that they are reduced in comparison with the former regime.
Another point of contention: The powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to the parliament, but a national defense council.
Likewise, there will be no ban on civil trial in military courts, as they have demanded the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter with also share their concerns about the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Moreover, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to comment last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the Head of State are on the march Saturday.
