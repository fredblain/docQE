Szabo: "The Germans must play greater role."
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balances in Berlin on a narrow diplomatic degrees.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then, Berlin abstained.
So why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, but be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it also supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also included the voice, when it came to set up a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take on major international issues a clear position?
Yes, that is true.
This is because it was just switch his foreign policy and away from a policy that were managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans appear so between the fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to.
I think they grope still to their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have in France or Britain.
What a "normal" foreign policy means because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent from those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have had an influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
That is why it needs to be careful to alienate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would not want to give too much weight, which is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, abstained from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe and even in the US, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Maybe Germany will record that even some respect.
Because it signals that it will be taken seriously as an international player and its interests have to be taken into consideration.
In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, have spoken out clearly for a veto.
Are there any differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has secretly quite sympathetic to the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government will be able to take that position publicly, of course not.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so like of Netanyahu's policy.
Germany, it is difficult to reconcile his close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side?
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany itself, if you look at the role as a major international players - wants to play a key role in Germany?
The leadership or Germany is still difficult?
Germany is not yet accustomed, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is difficult, the country still to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, there is every time Germany assumes a greater role, a variety of anti-German sentiment.
That makes it the Germans not easy.
This is the old problem: You want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this light, Germany is in a more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States declines in European politics, the EU to fill that vacuum at the moment but who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it, it makes them uncomfortable, and much more unpopular, c'est la vie!
