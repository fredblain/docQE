A cause of death due to AIDS is now too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis, the doctor tried to weaken without apparent success. "
He hid it from his family.
He decided to care only about his illness and began to gather information about it; and that with such dedication that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s, it was hard to imagine, as there are many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
Even then, the director of a clinic of the IMSS to adopt a marriage, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people in the hospital, who know nothing of their disease and where the virus has already caused damage to their immune system and exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections are still to come.
31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, after the first reported cases, means "the great success today that the survival of a patient, the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information in April of this year from a respected scientific publication had been backed up.
An expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life of the extent of the damage to the immune system, attached to the people at the beginning of the treatment, and greater opportunities for those who are dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years in a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4.
Put simply, mean the above that, who at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in that sense, "can be easily 75 years old, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to view this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today stands at an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality in recent years has decreased significantly (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS has reduced of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011, the annual report (yes), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the national database collected since the release of the patients have died of AIDS.
In Jalisco 2011 255 people died in the year, and until May of this year, there have been 187 deaths; however, be assured that there are since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviral drugs.
- Why do people die so still in it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drug. The problem is that people come in far advanced state, because they know their infection status, namely in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a telling statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have a secondary infection. In order to influence the global mortality earlier diagnoses are needed, and therefore must be offered to all people, where necessary, massive screening tests."
This proposal, voting experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de have plans del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients like Fabrizio, who his test at a private laboratory conduct, and that the only reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS era was, and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (like a cancer tumor) had, as one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some people think that they will die, and want to hear nothing.
"If I must die, then burst to three times, they say, in my case.
The amendment was aimed at the improvement, I feed me well, do exercises and take the medication.
Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everybody else.
"I work, do much to have an active and responsible sex lives, I am on my health and that of the other person," counts on Fabrizio, who agreed with his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony to encourage those who today in the context of the global AIDS day fear.
You should make the test if they belong to risk group. "The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they will learn to like all people can live in a responsible manner.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the simple citizens large holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the specific places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; before they were made separately, now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The risk of people for new infections among young people.
"Why do you need it?" Is a question of widespread derision by social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health care system that are exposed to young people, the correspondent said.
He proposed to orient these inefficient distribution; the condoms should be not just behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of institutions that are frequented by young people.
It should not be promoted the promiscuity.
It should be paid for them, not the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio Gonz√°lez replied to the question of whether it would be distributed under his administration condoms.
"Sexuality is not; it best to get the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
It's 13.435 cumulative cases (1.317 12.158 AIDS and HIV).
The state is in fourth place nationally in terms of new and cumulative AIDS cases and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infection cases are made through sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2% Perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because for every registered case 4 or 5 people who don't know it.
