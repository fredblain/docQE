The hardest job in the world: The human work animals from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they over 70 kilos of sulphur in the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work the hell, and others are literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by catching up sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the eastern part of the Indonesian island of Java.
He needs to rise every day, down on the floor of the crater, where the earth from the burned sulphurous gas in contact with the air itself.
Now that he has broken out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the downhill path of stone.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, and they have to keep the balance and put their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
You know that each step can cost their lives, as they have done, a French tourist who plummeted years ago to the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners from Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which reduce.
Above all, they are on the road between the tourists that they take pictures like circus monkeys and run at the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, which has set up a mining company a little below at an altitude of 1850 metres
The company PT Candi Ngrimbi who exploit said since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and its workers is never better), which she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
They then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life, and used in the manufacture of baking bread, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"As we normally carry 70 kg, we receive for each way around 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," said Anto, which is usually three flights a day.
For each route he takes three hours, after which he is completely done, at the end of the day, but then he has 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but would be three times what he earned with the field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) to be paid on the day, and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167), is very high," the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
He earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near, and that for a reason that Indonesia is as important as the sulphur: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, and his eyes are often coughing fit wanted because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto since three years of his life on the line at the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur left him at the first mark, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, and his eyes are often coughing fit wanted because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I will work here two years, because I open a shop or Spanish or French want to learn," he promises in a more than decent English.
This friendly and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could work as a tourist guide, waiters or at the front desk of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and every morning at 2 p.m., because the sulphur vapor and even at night, with its distinctive yellow color in the darkness shines bluish.
The shadows challenging, he rises in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money into the crater.
About 400 carrier download on the crater floor the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has not reduce the sulphur mechanized to save costs, and the agencies that are working on their own account and paid for by weight, no equipment.
You also get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this nature park, along with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to take photographs of the volcano and human animals.
"This work is for the animals and not humans" Madrusin, a stocky, 42-year-old vehicle, which operates three decades since leaving the school on Kawah Ijen protested.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, "as long as it is" because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I am not going to retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the eyes and throat itch, if the wind suddenly einklemmt turns and the miners in the thick pillars, rising from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains about serious diseases... of course, apart from the normal breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, back from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back with his 53 years Unainik is only able to take 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which has three trucks break a goat path between the bush to the camp in Taman Ari are transported in 18 miles away.
"I am not going to retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth, where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest works with his 30 years as a sulphur-carrier.
The time passes, but the mediocrity keeps generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: Those who work as human cargo el on Kawah Ijen.
