Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is on the planet Mercury ice.
The ice sheet is likely to be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there is frozen water there, too, as evidenced by three on Thursday in the journal "Science" published studies.
The Messenger probe found evidence that it is permanently in the shadow of the region of the planet, an ice sheet.
They should be at least 30 centimeters and may even be up to 20 meters thick.
The water came from comets or asteroids may also are underway on the Mercury.
No one put the discovery of ice, but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger-probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have come into other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the people of the earth probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix is to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: Small don into endless expanses.
The image comes from a camera that German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Of the eight planets in our solar system, the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is under the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, not a "Planet."
This view of a host of Spitzer's infrared telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: The oldest stars are as blue points, are more difficult to identify the pink "newborn" in the circle of stars.

One of the biggest and strongest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the color photographs of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The European Southern Observatory published photograph shows the Trifid several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius mistrust.
The name is derived from the Latin word Trifid trifidus (three shared, three divided), dark dust strips the fiery heart of stars-birthplace of three parts.
In no greater astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carom: 400 million light years from Earth, to head the cores of two verschmelzender galaxies and will inevitably collide with each other.

Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to the sportfishing.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been steadily - and the insights they deliver, deeper and deeper.
30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes you look into space just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Canarias Centro on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone, the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of cheap construction: The telescope is hanging in his elevation angle - and thus limited in his mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: The high light-gathering power.
This is, after all, despite comparatively low mirror diameter - in the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers will hear the space for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Trial" every computer owner can help by providing computing power.

Here, the Very Large Telescope - that is worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors the telescope is also in the infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO observatory is the European Extremely Large Telescope planned.
Its main mirror is to include a whopping 42 yards - and set out nearly 1,000 mirror elements together.
With 2018 at the earliest, however, is to be expected.
By 2007, were the two light-telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of 10 meters.
The light-telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which in addition to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF looks into the sky.
Also on the summit of Mauna Kea is a new, huge telescope with a mirror to emerge - an average of 30 meters.
Here, it is to watch on an illustration.
The main impressions from the All supplies, however, the Hubble space telescope.
Since the April 24, 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler searches for extrasolar planets - especially for those who are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, was announced by the radio transmission that 1,235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission.
In the picture, the last launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope are documented.

One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to seek light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that also exists at the South Pole ice of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data, as the Messenger far closer to the North Pole revolves around the planet.
Radar measurements have been for decades, points out that there are on the Mercury ice.
The messenger probe was launched in 2004 - the first, which revolves around the Mercury, the scientists now have certainty.
