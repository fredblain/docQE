Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland has been on a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the twentieth member of the space agency, Poland is the second member state from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008, ESA member was).
Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with the European Space Agency and participated in the following years in several ESA projects.
The path of Poland into space, however, began much earlier.
Even before World War II Polish cosmos fans deal with the space, but they were not always understood.
I recall, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "entrance to the Space Exploration."
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) cold left the audience, however, and after years of Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the Space Exploration" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie's and André Louis Hirsch donated Prix REPS-Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognised contribution to the development of the space has been acknowledged by, among other things, that one of the craters was named on the side of the moon erdabgewandten after him.
In 1925 was in Poland, a railway trolley, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to brake the trolley.
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research led the institute Komórka Tech NIKI Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The surviving documents show that the research has got to the stage of practical tests.
The research, however, was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 turned up in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, draft photoelectric hunt rocket, and the following year was the work of "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba Lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war were all projects for the military use of missile technology from the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, but his work was completed by the start of war.
Another article on space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the journal problemy, in which four major items of space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of an aerospace company.
At the time, there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.
At its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA sought accession to the International Federation for space travel, founded in 1951, and indeed, the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956 member.
The following year, became the first PTA-Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
This office he had until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA significantly participated in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on October 10, 1958.
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was approximately 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 pounds.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959 and began in the Bledowska Desert flight tests with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another development stage should already be able to provide real scientific work - the rocket RM 34 should remain at an altitude of up to 14.5 km and reach for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, the further development has been.
The first missiles of the type RM was in 1962 to 1965 meteor-1 rocket being developed.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length cm amounted to 510 and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
These three types of rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which is the size of the transport area for scientific instruments were different.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 liters capacity, meteor-1B about 0.34 liters and meteor-1c states about 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude was in all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, was in the aviation institute the meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to a payload of 10 kg, at an altitude of about 60 km to transport.
Later versions of the meteor-2H and Meteor-3 built.
It is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee followed.
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos program in space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miro Law Hermaszewski after the Czech cosmonaut Vladimir Remek second Inter.
