Rakfisk from Norway: The übelriechendste fish in the world is this?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
The secret to the success of the country might have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of mature cheeses.
One place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And they leave a week.
So you have to think about the smell of nasenbetäubenden Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which will not simply disappear.
Rakfisk bestreute trout, which - depending on how you would like his stinky fish hall 4 - up to a year in water with salt.
When the darkness comes in Norway on the country and the weather is colder, Norwegian flows into a celebration here at Fagernes, which this is, well, really very impressive speciality.
"We eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen that actually works in the local fire station, but, as a "general" the Rakfisk festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take on large quantities of alcohol.
"People like the Mansche from more than the Rakfisk," Harvard said.
The spirit can oust the smell.
I eat a few bites.
If it fails to bring the Rakfisk in nasal proximity, he is not a bad thing, such as sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling capacity and soaked fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In the deepest winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and, no doubt using alcohol consumed in subdued senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to find work to leave their country and immigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who was not so long ago, much richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly fragrant part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive meals, which you can buy here.
But everything here is really expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs as much as 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people seem to disrupt it.
Here you hate them still to mention by name - Anders Breivik shot the racist right-wing extremists, who last year, 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it focuses only on the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegian find it hard to accept that someone is capable in its peace-loving country to such brutal killings.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway's growth since the early 1970s, one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are so good," Anna, our waitress says that round tablets distributed with mature Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are, as they say - a prudent people.
Her English is like that of the majority of people here are spotless.
We are not very declaring, we do not like bragging.
Norway has been very cautious with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested for the benefit of future generations into a special fund.
When all cast in the years before the Great Depression with money around, which they had not, Norway held his wallet.
"As long as we go in winter, skiing and hiking can go in the summer, we are" happy, Anna says.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," she adds with easy laughter.
I stand in the snow and another court to ask me for - from Rakfisk I have enough.
As a moose-burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat told me.
But on the evening of the Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel where I stayed, is one of several venues that organize the Rakfisk-dinner, where guests in the best sense of smell - or perhaps the most challenging - fish vote.
There is a live TV circuit with a fly-clad presenters, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What did you score up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Our points, Harvard are."
Are sharing and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict haze of the whole fish.
