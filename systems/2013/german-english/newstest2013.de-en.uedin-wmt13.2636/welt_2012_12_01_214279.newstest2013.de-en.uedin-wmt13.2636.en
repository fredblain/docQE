The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as the basis is controversial.
The Egyptian president saved with pathos.
We need to create the transition.
"And that he will succeed is in my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all people, but especially well to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because they all hopelessly divided thus far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile from grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had, Mohammed Morsi said almost entschuldigend, temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and its powers expanded, "to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, as are the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles from the Islamist-dominated the 100-member constituent assembly in one night, 15-hour Parforceritt were pushed through, some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also stated in the draft, the case law based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
It was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will take advantage of the vague wording and related legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This is at least a new article conducted near: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al-Ashar upon University, the main Islamic institution in the country with great power in the entire Sunni Islam.
It is not necessary, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which de facto the disenfranchisement of the judiciary as a result.
Much in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is subject to interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should remain intact.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule on the repression of political opponents.
After the fall of the dictator of up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
The state should also, as it is in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote their morals and values. "
It is legally so unclear that state institutions control with the help of this article, even the content of film art and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
For another bans, the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to insult or slander.
But what is an insult and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Similarly, the phrase seems dubious, "insulting people is prohibited.
Already a caricature of the president or a joke there will at the expense of a Leader?
Open to interpretation, like so much in the draft, before Morsi to sign and after his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians on the referendum.
"The revolution has returned."
The opposition formed for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed that the Charter to fail before they can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will prevail," said Sabbahi lean, Drittplatzierter of presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said that the draft constitution "belong on the scrapheap of history."
Via short messaging service Twitter, he accused supporters of Morsi's desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and" him, the opposition Jasser Said said.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brothers are not punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Khaled Ali.
And several judges announced to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves on the counter-demonstration, as a precaution, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Bank of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafi attended and shouting: "The people calling for the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "Don the country!" And protested: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, probably would have provoked civil war-like situation.
That obviously wanted to risk Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide through the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word" human rights is not even
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would have actually until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when they sat in jail under Mubarak or in court.
Because he would not share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible.
This, he was beaten, convicted, and imprisoned.
"And now the word is not even human rights in the new constitution," he laments in conversation with the "world on Sunday."
Morsi's extension to all three powers in the state were forecast, the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president put them de facto repeal," laments Saeda.
But without civil society organisations a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which sees the ideological direction fight on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
It could be revenge.
The protesters in Tahrir warns: "Your geb√§hrt a monster that you can no longer control."
