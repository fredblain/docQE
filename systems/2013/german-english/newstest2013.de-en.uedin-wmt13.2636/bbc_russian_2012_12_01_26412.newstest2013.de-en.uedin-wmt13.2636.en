In recent days, it was everywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to swell further or whether they will soon be back in the air.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-leaning nonprofit organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary Walmart- and fast-food workers are monitoring the organizers of the protests aimed to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is not unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, which sell-outs were held in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to Handgemengen.
On this day, put some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, their work and his mother, together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain aimed at lower- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores is, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, buy many of the Walmart-only slightly paid employees at the workplace.
Prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart into one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can sell the goods often so cheap, because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain about severe conditions, for example, lack of forklift or hand scanners.
The participants of the protest at the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart-employee who 9.5 US dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company increases the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, Walmart would cost 3.2 billion dollars.
There are about 1.1% more than they donate now for pay.
If the wage increases Walmart fully pass to the customers, cost of each purchase them in the future, only 46 cents more.
It would be a year for them, compared to more spending by only 12,39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that it came only in nine states to protests and the company gave no losses.
The Black Friday took into his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in that period, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of the Walmart-cash at the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees work laid down and the protest action "just another PR trick" of the union, which organized the protest, was.
"Free cash!"
The protests were this week in New York, where their goal but not Walmart stores (which in this progressive city not wanted and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work.

Currently, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law stands at $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants will gradually raise the minimum wage, but not too much, and, on average, get their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars an hour.
No one less than they deserve in this expensive city.
How is it possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was once a time when nearly a quarter of all American youngsters after school at McDonald's behind the counter, however, the young people still lived with their parents.
No one saw this as the main source of income, or planned to stay there.
Now you meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's constant people who complain that they get along with this wage and sometimes have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is the forum of the newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, a comment, whose author points out, it would be irresponsible to have children, if one does not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants a minimum wage of 15 US dollars an hour, as more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
It further demanded the formation of unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits the corporate governance, to stand in the way of that goal and union members to dismiss or issue early warnings.
On the other hand, it makes the corporate governance not easy.
The formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason for the high staff turnover.
With them,
There have been vocal protests on that day before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and you will pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should together, the fast-food employees support so that they receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on the ground, far from everyone in the fast-food industry are employed in the tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether these protests will be the spark mobilize whole mass.
