Prostate cancer screening: The test should be done or not?
The PSA test point indeed sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to a greater reluctance of cowardly men for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists.
The studies carried out in the United States, many disturbances between the control group, so it is difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in mortality rates of patients with and without detection.
The study also showed that the probability of the formation of metastases is at an observation post after 12 years by 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was carried out.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years ago or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, who had been ill with prostate cancer.
In men, Afro-American origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was detected.
There are cancers that aggressive and others who are Indo-.
The extent of the risk to the patient's cancer must be made very clear by the options available to him, where prostate crabs can remain untreated, if it affects the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it opts for a more active surveillance of the disease.
Today, there is no treatment for many men, where it has detected cancer, because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active surveillance and offers them in progression of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy is one of the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not.
Therefore, I recommend the implementation of the test.
But the most important thing is to talk with your doctor to determine whether he should be executed or not.
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed a tool with which it is possible to the pros and cons of the PSA tests to evaluate.

Disease prevention of
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and move enough.
"If there were no smoking this value would rise to at least 50%", André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain unresolved completely.
For the Canadian Cancer Society remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem the risk for breast, colon wrath, fattening bowel, for cancer of the oesophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against colon cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm- or rectum cancer.
Sausages, should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the cells, and the development of cancer," he says.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
But their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While a study has to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also not yet shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is to talk with your doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
