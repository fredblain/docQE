Héctor "Hetin Reyes": "Basketball was my life."
The city of Los Angeles, Héctor "Hetin Reyes" was linked to the basket sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world as a whole.
Few people in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of Los Angeles as the country's "Héctor" Hetin Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, Rexes was 6 years part of this sport, whether as a player of lower classes, players in the first national league, agent and manager in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My whole life I have many hats," set up in basketball, even more at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, CEO and president of the Association of the national team in the 1990s, Reyes recalled during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of almost all of his long career and prove it.
The heart Bayamón
The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he and his 15-year-old anniversary as manager of the club or has celebrated.
"That was my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of the Vaqueros eight championships since 1967, as managing director, has or be allowed to coach.
There were a lot of rewarding years, including five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy with BSN.
Since then, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "Reyes said.
I know that I am Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2-foot-tall player.
You want him? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico had ever.
Bartow recommended on the free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best.... and suspension.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for further care.
With the championship of the Vaqueros Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, because he was already in 1988 at the top of the association.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
After the World Cup in 1990, when it occupied the fourth place, which ought to be bronze, if this would not have been Canadian referee, who had to repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the World Cup in 1990, was the best national team that you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won the Olympic Games in 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite, the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won the team gold and offered the United States a fight is, however, as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
The team Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were not only back, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who was in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities, not the best, but we won a gold medal and gave us great joy was vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in woodlands, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
It was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking account of his career in different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Arman Dito Torres.
The boy, the work of Leo Arill like me well.
What do you believe is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s until 17 teams in a season.
What remains to be done unto you?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The guys that play in Ponce, for example, only in their field and meet only in the national game on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children are unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, table-officials and referees.
I am proud of.
What you do today?
I listen to music, watch videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
