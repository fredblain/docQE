It was said that with the laws of the black market trade would benefit, which lead to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
"The laws are too serious, unintended consequences," Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia says.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.

Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade, "King of the pack" in downtown Sydney, says the single packaging have hampered the filling its shelves.
"In the past I have used an hour to sort it a delivery, now I need four," Yu said.
