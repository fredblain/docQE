Real estate scandals large-scale in Quebec
Officials of the Road Administration, the company Bauhauptgewerbes, Geldbeschaffer political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia every day to tell what they know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso involved.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, in particular, and students.
"It is strange how the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures," Jacques Duchesneau, provide Member in Quebec and former director of the Montreal police.
The scandal was exposed by him as a result of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which had voted in favour of the then prime minister only reluctantly.
"Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stresses, "the Department of Transportation" could have saved a billion dollars in the treaties, because some zügelten in their instinct to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors on a case," he adds, in the hope that it achieves "tactics behind the individuals to show."
A 2011 launched, permanent anti-corruption unit
The 2011 launched, permanent anti-corruption unit is doing with their armies of accountants, most analysts and the government also great efforts.
In addition, the police force, "the" interviewees told me that since 2009 has meant that the "sewer cartel" of Montreal in artificial bloating of the Treaties restrained approach...
In recent weeks, it has carried out a series of raids and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against local representatives such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who is from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city, resigned.
He is alleged to have received in exchange for public contracts repeated bribes.
Moreover, engineers explicitly accused of road construction office of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino zambito.
The latter has caused a stir when he said the Commission of the functioning of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He has several years paid 3% of the value of the contracts to a preserved in Montreal with the Mafia related mediator, who gave the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr zambito has everywhere in the 2000s had his hand in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) at provincial parties, especially the Liberal Party was in power at the time.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fund raising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him.
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles surprenant put it before the Commission described in detail: In 10 years he received from the construction company gifts, free trips, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736.000 in exchange for sewer contracts, costing it artificially pumping up.
Other officials of the Road Administration have admitted that they lubricate left by the bills with false additional services artificially inflated by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay has accused that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget, which filled its coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, who blew the whistle.
As mayor of the municipality Rivière-of-prairies, in the eastern part of the island, rejected them from 2010 against the sale of parish property, purchased for $5 million and 1.6 million in property developers in the booming real estate market has been sold.
70% of black money in the election campaigns
The study, carried out in the end, she says that she is "on a thread that makes it possible to understand the workings of the ants under immigration system to stop the evil and denounce the culprits."
She says that the procedure "was painful, but positive."
We are going to clean the wound, but only for Montreal would need a certain investigative unit, as well as a supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How do clean.
A regular.
For his part, Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is especially concerned about the role of the "mandate, which are about the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a share of 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he provide: "I was told that it was just a poor substitute for the reality."
The government of Quebec proposes that the donations to political parties to $100 to limit what he says nothing about the situation would change, "as long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, will be black money in politics in circulation."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the procurement and the financing of political parties: "We cannot fall deeper; if we do the things with courage to the bottom, we can build the house on a sounder basis with more controls and laws."
If this story is damaging the international image of Quebec and Montreal that Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh about it to look in their own backyard.
