Their own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde," which is dedicated to urban dwellers who form the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the select list already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the boundaries of the city, and they often find recognition in Europe landed without being in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of the extravagant Rosbalt artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded dressed in red, sometimes at the Russian Museum, sometimes in the summer garden, sometimes with scene-meeting or private viewings.
Wherever the images are issued by Kirill Miller, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social and philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and conjured up by his presence on the streets of his fellow citizens and smile at them for good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and was felt at the Petersburg barrel organ player, as he is for this difficult role in terms of his artistic life, his philosophy and his image is finally ready.
- Kirill, why you're always in red and yellow and turquoise, for example, through the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red, the compromise between artist, image consultants and society.
In the company of anything that deviates from the norm is, aggression and bad behavior.
However, I will come through my provocations with the people.
Each of my past provocations an invitation for a conversation.
- When you knew that you have to be a painter?
- In the main exhibition in the Palace of Culture, where my work were on display.
I realized that I have to go down this path.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter went back to an end, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible.
I am friends with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was "Pushkinskaya 10," and then end was only once.
It takes me to the theater, to the fashion, to music, to everything except the literature.
- And all united in your kind clinic... - it was important for me, in the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best artists congregate.
In 1995 I occupied an area in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there were up to the renovation of a musical and artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born: NAME., Tequilajazzz, and I remember well how cord came with his project "Ucho Van Goga" there.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore T-shirts, and close to them belonged to the now trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, "Leningrad" was from her.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli Galli-."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics.
The gallery "D" or the club "137 Griboedov" originate in the art-clinic.
There were our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, meant as a culture.
In 2000, there was a poll in the press, which was about the award "personalities of our city."
I won in the category of "artist of the year," and I was arrived at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
At present, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous to do without a cultural contribution.
- your work has a distinctive style.
- many of my pictures are real pearls and bring out the timeliness and sharpness of thought.
I will be an exhibition with the theme "The Russian museum have" as clowns.
Clowns are timeless.
Before I was socially, but now it hurts and fear, so to be.
In a clown that blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by telling people that everyone has completely.
Now everyone looks at the clothes and focuses on the exterior and not on the inside of the human being.
But perhaps we should not be a person's hand, but should he spit in the face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
Recently, we saw you in the role of urban barrel organ player. - A cultural city should have a hero.
Who, if not I?
- commercial art can be beautiful?
Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and be flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
In the past, people were large groups: The bohemian loved one and the ordinary people of the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not one hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now, you'll have to think about whom you will like.
Now, every cult star has about 100 supporters.
- Among the appearances of several thousand Boneheads Michailow come!
- On him come abandoned women, there is the sexually-social sphere.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there are fewer management, money, and everything is based.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is to cheat them and destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I have painted these pictures, which were hung from a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images, which are usually only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It intellectual culture and consumer culture means.
Consumption has no culture, which is quite another.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and money refused to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
They say: Servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real tsars, it was different, because the Czars understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that right experts are needed.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have, the way could be the experts, but they are blocked because it requires more high-level experts who assess the former right and clear the way for them.
Now, only the own taste.
The same is true for the Erarta, must, however, with the difference that they say honestly that they do not accept all contemporary art and some artists find so other museums.
Petersburg - What is for you?
Petersburg - is not the European Capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones art can grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for example, we now have more writers and readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people visit the exhibitions and concerts.
Us that are much less.
Art needs to be modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
