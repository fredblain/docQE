Daily drink butter - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country where 97-year-old are still relatively young.

A search in the country where 97-year-old are still relatively young.
The trip through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic to name.
The mini-bus rumbled through the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might say, being in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here, the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, not much, except that she speaks perfect Farsi and Aserisch and is very durable.
Stop Lerik.
The small town of flaunts too impressively three architecture from Soviet times, which is so not fit into the picturesque mountains.
Tourists from Europe come barely here too onerous the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
Of the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours because the road is only single.
The fabulous wealth the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the Eurovision song festival famous - and next year we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen documented from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years ago, a child conceived
But the controversial star of the museum of the shepherd Şirali Müslümov is to have become 168 years old.
However, there is a birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 here in the region, in 1973, he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, aged 136 years ago, he is said to have fathered a daughter.
A Şirali Müslümov has billed his age by a couple of decades?
But even Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are a lot of striking hochaltrige people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia live very many very old men."
Due to a lack of documentation was, however, no scientific evidence to bring about the age, marital status register lacked.
Every day, melted butter cups
The fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often striking reach a Biblical age, however.
Currently, there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.
Why are so many high elderly live here in the south?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the specific genes of Talyschen.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, believes that it is up to the diet.
But it is the high-calorie diet of Talyschen should be as healthy, love the meat, bread and milk products, and drink a glass of every day, many of whom melted butter, appears from a nutritional point of view, not just plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps young people in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years for these latitudes, it is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wood house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor with a butter barrels, which they move tirelessly and herrollt.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are now grandparents.
Two young children are jumping.
In the kitchen prepares one at home, in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu-glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly to under her headscarf, she hides long, dark blond braids that reveals her son proudly in front of us.
I washed my hair with milk, so they were never me and retained their color.
"I have never used shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to
She has only ever eaten that what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyev," Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange coming from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
By 2003, he was in power, his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need for Azerbaijan's elderly.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), receives a monthly pension Mirzayeva, for local conditions, an amount that it is possible to live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas long gray son is correct: "The elderly in our culture of respect."
They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved and cared for, are happy.
If that is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive
