NKÚ chief: Control of the black-and-system through the fault of the policy fails
The Czech Republic has linked to public contracts on good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, however, falls in their application.
In the interview for this Aktuálně.cz says the vice president of the Supreme Control Office (nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly, and I think that this is not the case," KALA comments on the current situation.
A similar outcome is also a joint control by Czech and German auditors is apparently.
As an example of bad practice, he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so-called "black-system."
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would harass the entrepreneurs with controls - the system is now banned or permitted?
"But the law must have valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then the government chairman is not easy, and the surveillance office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, not in his work," notes KALA.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries in terms of public contracts were compared.
So what was there?
It is a parallel investigation with which we have started about two years ago.
Put simply, it is important that the European legislature decides how to handle public contracts and the national legislation to build and, finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this, we have compared with each other, and even though the investigation is not over yet, we have to observe extremely interesting differences. "Generally speaking, the laws are with us, maybe even a little" strict and perfect, "but the actual application in Germany in some parameters.
Thus, it is not enough to create new and more detailed rules is confirmed, we must also deal with the actual application of the law.
Whether the project can you help? What do you for this project?
It is such a joint control could help that we cease to strive constantly to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing thresholds, though it has apparently not very positive.
Efficiency means to buy something at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be that we are straining the system in this way only with excessive "paperwork," and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system when the threshold values remained if higher.
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law.
How the system works in Germany?
Is there a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
With regard to the authorities, the German counterpart is the NKÚ of the Federal Audit Office, which is similar to us and also a college, which is only slightly different, however, in principle, work both authorities.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is, however, a federal state, which means that there are these auditors in individual states - that is the German system different from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funding, which is in line with our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by us from the counties and municipalities, are subject to the control of state auditors.
With regard to the German legislation, which is easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare with no concrete details. Nevertheless, Germany is in some ways, often described as a model, but you can certainly not say, however, that Germany is considered better.
That is perhaps because the auditors are there better?
This is not, however, such comparisons, I may not particularly like.
In this regard, it can be noted that even those countries which are a model for us, are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, no?
With regard to the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority had the revision of the public procurement law, you already feel any impact?
Given that this novel is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests.
Since our controls take place later, one must expect a certain delay.
So far, we feel the effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new instrument of control "detection of risks of inefficiency" and tested with this almost 14,000 public contracts and analyzed, the changes will certainly have an impact, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of calls have been modified, etc.
You see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
It can occur, however, the problem is that the rules are "strict" and could not be met.
Under the previous rules, a review unterzogenen people are against the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) accountable to the effect that any breach of the public procurement law breaches of discipline.
But is it sensible to make the law even tougher?
I think not in this way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack the system and abuse, and not to punish those who have committed a formal errors, which affects the real decision-making.
Such a system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out here?
Let us first of all, what is not targeted.
The prime minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with control of the so-called "black-system" badgering, what does that mean exactly?
If the black-system now banned or permitted?
A bill must have valid, and if something is illegal, then the government chairman is not easy, and the surveillance office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, not in his work.
He can say: "We change the law and allow the matter," but he could not say that we act as if nothing had.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, but it is also tragic if the bidder is ruled out with the best offer alone due to procedural errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what is missing here, in my opinion.
