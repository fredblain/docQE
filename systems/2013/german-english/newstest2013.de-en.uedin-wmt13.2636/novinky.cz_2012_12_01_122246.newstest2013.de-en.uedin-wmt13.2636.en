Guidelines for inflating of balloons, bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges proclaims this year has decided that the "most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea of recently put forward by the EU plan brought us, a women's quota of 40% to introduce in the management of large European companies," said Patrik nacher, who cares about the organization of this survey, compared with the daily Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice is located on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
In the meantime, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, for the insurance companies because they objectively pose less risk.
"Another incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will be by the end of February 2013, "nacher informed.
On the controversial EU regulations of the mandatory admixture of bioethanol for fuel, which is damaging nature in its wake, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because it is a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on size of chicken cages, this year because of the eggs were much more expensive.
Criticism of the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs has earned in the past.
Bananas have to be 14 cm long
The EU machine often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more member countries are represented as the Czech Republic tries (currently, for example, with veto-threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks).
Lobby interests were also behind it that banana trade of the highest class in the EU must be at least 14 inches long and no "curvature anomaly" exhibit.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that they are merely harmonisiere the fragmented national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries already on the grounds that the previous directives to a waste of food would lead.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons in the sale must be accompanied by saying that children under eight years of the balloon without the supervision of an adult would fail.
The EU, citing an American study, according to balloons are the leading cause of death by suffocation of children.
A similar restriction applies for children up to 14 years for the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious incursions at home
Relatively absurd, a directive that European officials themselves subject - everyone who plays in the EU, an official function, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece does not use the name Macedonia and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities laissez on behalf of the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a member country.
The EU imposed the maximum volume of food supplies, which is on the day of our EU accession in the territory of the Czech Republic was allowed to decide.
The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, and a large fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or by the idea of giving grants for applications for funding.
These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are put at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will be asking for a refund from the EU, "the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas said in the autumn of 2004 (Abitur).
He gave as an argument that the grain harvest was very high and the state-run camps were overcrowded, as a result of the so-called intervention buying.
As the Czech Republic took another route to sea ports, according to the palace, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros in us.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, was so far that they organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding provided the municipalities of the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically, should it be funding for the setup of grant money requests to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the Member States is easily the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and therefore deserves more recognition for efficiency and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however.
A more serious problem is that experts believe the EU funding for projects that absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration have in common, but in the budget negotiations have been forced by individual member states.
Emotions also evokes here, the fact that the Czech Republic is similar to other member countries in Brussels for the right to use specific names of traditional products and fight this battle is not over.
Even so, the Czech Republic, after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria called Olomoucké tvarůžky defend "the Inländerrum Tuzemský (rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, we had to rename our manufacturers, however, in" Tuzemák. "
The name rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU, of Carlsbad rusks, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or even the Saazer hops in the company of the world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham.
With an EU-brand to the Pardubice gingerbread or Hořicer roles pride.
