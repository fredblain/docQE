Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The blame for this Singapurer that they have no children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children's education.
"The people of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civic duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons yet, or precisely because they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper's songs, which local slogans such as "pushing a" (Netherlands) loaf in the oven, about the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun.
The advertising agency BBH, who shot the video, preserves the hope that the commercial reaches in a funny way to raise awareness of the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to perform their "national duty."
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and witty.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproduce, we are the worst performer in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of speed-dating evenings (quick flirt).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why do we not do something as creative as possible to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?
1.2 children.
Anyone who takes this issue is not easy, is the Government of Singapore.
Every year, it's $1,300 for political measures to encourage people to have more children.
A package of government for married couples and parents paid up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributes tax advantages.
But everything has had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in south-east Asia, which is also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why the Singapurer not get more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policies of the national population authority, says that it was a "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social realities have contributed to the higher number of people living alone and delay marriage and birth, the result is reducing the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, led an immigration policy aimed at a sharp rise in immigration to counter the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites where the barely concealed xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants to be criticized, especially against the Chinese, who, for keeping wages low and integrate.
The rise in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher fees and charges for foreign workers.
An unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the growth of a nation, the tax revenue that health costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "shoe boxes" and be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and show a huge sales success.
However, the concern that they can support the lifestyle of the people living alone, and that they alienate the construction of which is to build large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" to sell much faster than larger apartments.
They are so popular, and the units are for days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger units.
This means that they are for our cash flow is much better.
He admits, however, that the new standards developers give clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if the new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, according to the talks with the Singapurern who work in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are very stressed that the housing and education are expensive, so it will be delayed by many people," a young manager says.
The children can get others.
"For me, it is important to have my own money and time," another, about 20-year-old man says.
Men and women to lead their careers, the stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much.
