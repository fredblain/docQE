Ornest Šimon: At our concerts, we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about that the doomsday is scheduled to take place in less than a month?
This is one of those disasters messages that we pounce people so much.
With our band The Tap Tap we care more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to halt the doomsday or prevent.
In December, you realize a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we plan for two years.
For this, we want the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end on December 21, at 11: 10 a.m. forecast.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will be held from 9: 00 p.m. at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be roughly at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, in a time zone 14 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends.
This idea comes from whom?
Originally from me, then we have fleshed out the idea, together with our graficdesigner Honza Augusta.
We do not want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the doomsday, but we also want to consider, together with the public on the state of the world we hand over our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, shirts, bags and key supporters against the doomsday developed, with its purchase of www.e-tap.cz people can support us, too.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers also included the so-called anthem against the doomsday titled "doomsday comes from."
Today, the national anthem on YouTube is very popular. If it is playing to the benefit concerts?
Of course, and provided in the end, that everything is fine and the doomsday is not...
The anthem is to be sung by all the performers on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted together in a direct circuit from the Czech Television.
The text of the anthem of Tomáš HANÁK, who plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also sings with Xindl X...
As you have come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which has to do with the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts.
We try to integrate these people hard in our projects.
It was clear that most to cooperate with us are interested, and have fun.
The purpose of the proceeds of the concerts benefits against the doomsday?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo where we already six years together with the club in the Tap Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly attended by editors who help them in different activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to travel to the editors, we want to help them in this way.
In connection with the completion of the Jedlička Institute is a private building, in which we will move in this project.
At every concert, several groups and performers.
On what criteria you have chosen them?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support lesbiens occur Illustratosphere with Dan Gemini, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Learn everything else on the Website www.kpks.cz.
A similar "big events are also planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would also like to appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Its overseas plans are not very small, so far, you already have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold. Moreover, we must, of course, many instruments, suitcases and other bags waiting...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, CSA On-and British Airways were always prepared very well for us that I have sometimes surprised by some.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad to compare the situation in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabilities you have and so on.
As you have seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnesses that everything is in the East is still in its infancy.
In Prague, Moscow is absolutely not, where it is still unusual, if someone is in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is, of course, there is not even that one vorlässt a wheelchair user, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are clubs who are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things where we are behind...
It is, however, noted that an improvement in the situation still depends on the efforts of the parties concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities operate independently in the public space, who can use toilets etc.
But it is not customary for a larger group of disabled people actively involved in the public arena, we are with the band The Tap Tap slightly ahead of the West.
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks, things will really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly will strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to form a band?
Then I started as a manager in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in, with a little hard to deal with.
And since I myself am among musicians and saxophone playing, I, along with a colleague, a music-AG.
Well, and over time, that is, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič laughs, likes to say, things get out of control.
The band was known, but only in recent years, or I am wrong?
It is true that helped us the cooperation with well-known singers; we also have also begun actively campaigning for us.
We became aware that if one is doing something and see it is not outwardly, has his own performance in a sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can be as good, high-quality equipment and etc.
Was it your goal to bring it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning, I sensed the potential that we can do things differently.
In show business, one of the other copies today.
This is logical in its own way, as anything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long period of time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap.
The first impression of the viewer has mostly is, of course, have pity; it is only natural.
But the pity is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned beings that we would regret.
There are people who can live a full life and develop, provided they have the necessary funds.
I always say that when people with disabilities can do something, not only for themselves is a step forward, but for the whole society.
It was for this success is also helpful, that you are a strong leader, we hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, we must make no compromises and in many areas demand also needs a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and once they realise that they have tested twice a week, complete preparation stages and have to spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm among many expires.
So it works everywhere, in every band who work seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were from the beginning, i.e., since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. "People come and go, and that we cannot prevent.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.
