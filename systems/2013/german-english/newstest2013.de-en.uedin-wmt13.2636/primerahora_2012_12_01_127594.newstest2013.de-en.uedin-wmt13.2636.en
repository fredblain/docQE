But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the next two months: The destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place where the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester that it ever was," said Charmé this week, students at the University of Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.

On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague, Amara Solari, a beisitzende professor of art history and anthropology have formed a team to offer a course with the simple title "The end of the world."
"We are not in 2012, so that we retain the option to be able to hold the course, in the event that the world" will not go under, Restall said.
Despite the "impending doom" students need to study, create projects and participate in audits.
Penn State in the final examination will be carried out on the eve of the apocalypse, so the students have no other chance to continue working as a "until the night, where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no seats," Restall said of his course for students with a high average, which filled with 35 students.

The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that an apocalyptic fear is the Western society, which dates back several centuries, when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.

Restall pointed out that over the years has been spoken many days from the last court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "was thinking people immediately to a new date," or philosophy, that the December 21, the start of a seven-year period, according to the end of the world.
