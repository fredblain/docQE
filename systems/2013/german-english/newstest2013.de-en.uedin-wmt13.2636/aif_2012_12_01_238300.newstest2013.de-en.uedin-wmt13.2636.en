"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language.
While lawmakers and civil rights activists are debating the usefulness of the law on compulsory language tests for immigrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the upkeep of the remaining families in the country.
On December 1, a law in force, according to which each working immigrant must pass a test, certified the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and retail.
However, the tests over time, according to the migration agency transformed in the future for all guest workers will be on duty.
At the same time, we must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills are both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also, with the exception of this law, people who received their education certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
, and protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the examination will be put under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of peoples friendship, the Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can pass the tests in all cities; now more than 160 such centers have been opened in Russia already.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, however, questioned before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: What makes the whole thing?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills, both for the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, spokesman for the migration agency reply that it seeks to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," the head of the representation of the Federal Migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew says.
However, their rights must be protected even before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment to 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.
On problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant languages will inevitably face without people with evil intentions, which put him under the pretext of aid into a dark, narrow barracks, where he will stay with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home is promised you that target, and on arrival, you will get cheated their passports, and do not get the promised salary," the head of the main administration acknowledges for labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not ranting, chief!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they not only speak the language of the target country, but also in their own language hardly put in writing.
Of course, this is not so much her fault as the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also provide a sound basic education.
Because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager, these children will immediately take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language skills, admit it.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists say the law following important aspect.
The test must discard only migrants with legal status.
Do you have this status, so there is no test and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, spent the majority of the guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Warmly welcome" or "forbidden access for unauthorised persons."
Many of the migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, are the linguistic difficulties.
It also costs the legalization of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our most falsified documents and we are not registered, and cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and" tea, the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow speaks to journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers."
Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates to certify the completion of the language tests, were taken hostage by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The falsified papers were printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners were it not for nothing: Each migrant who hoped to spare as the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates are not available for simple, are both officials and civil rights activist.
For the moment, the authorities of immigrant workers who fall for the first time by the test, promising only that it is time for a language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills will be offered jobs in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
