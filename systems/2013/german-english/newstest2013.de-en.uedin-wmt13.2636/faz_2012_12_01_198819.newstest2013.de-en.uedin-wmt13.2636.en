"Trademark protection" in China: If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani, a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What Armani Polo is?
Behind them, a China officially registered designation, which has nothing to do with the original company.
However, she enjoys protection as long as the actual name donors complain.
And even then, it is not clear whether they get right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing says, who specializes in copyright violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
The imitators range a few additional letters, so that they can register their trademarks.
It is easy for Gucci Lu-Gucci, Prada is rather than one Prada-Kny.
German companies are legally copied in this way, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Patt hole opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name, used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna left there.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in the copying and the injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
Patt hole cases but are different: On behalf of his clients, he is opposed to Chinese companies from the Trademark Office officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is geared to "Bang Dakuan."
Thus, women are meant that fishing is rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"This is bad for business, you have to fight," Patt hole.
"The brand will be diluted, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research firm CLSA China is with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trade register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure may stretch, with an uncertain outcome.
Patt hole reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints because of the name, objected to "market reality is for the long term."
If the plaintiff had bad luck, he had to pay even imitated the money because he violated its brand in China, stalemate hole says.
Sometimes, the law of the jungle here.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker plaster.
Therefore, the Chinese may still use an emblem, which is similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely was originally a blue-white logo, which reminded of BMW, the dispute has been resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion maker Lacoste lost in China against followers from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile could look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any guilt.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits that it gave in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and equipment shortages.
Last year, but it was returned from the "emergency situation in the workflow to normality."
So the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost featuring such cases, we have concluded, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 objections on completion are still in the office.
By contrast, it costs a lot to
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications were received at the CTMO trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record, meant that China come up for the 10th time in a row, the list of featured in all over the world, the authority with shares.
That holds true for the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million.
2011, had been taken 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
It simply means that any application on average cost 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
By contrast, addressing a multiple costs, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese copy.
The Germans were able to ensure that the illegal manufacturing imitation motor vehicle parts was mined.
But the followers secured the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg.
But even that failed because surnames in Germany could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler, the Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical heading in Munich said.
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich because.
In the next two instances of Freudenberg got it right, but the process opponents continue fighting until today.
Must be extremely
Now, the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could be difficult to quantify, the company archives have even a hundred-year-old acts with regard to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered by the other side in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to resolve.
"This shows how much it is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East zur√ºckzuschwappen even threaten to Europe.
Then, when imitators secure there unprotected brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he was able to reverse the registration.
"It must be extremely carefully," Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole to rates of German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather the foreigners "should register everything that is worth protecting, somehow, even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg below deck in the last act of his trademark drama, then we would have to pay royalties for the other side's own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be forced in the segment in question out of the market.
