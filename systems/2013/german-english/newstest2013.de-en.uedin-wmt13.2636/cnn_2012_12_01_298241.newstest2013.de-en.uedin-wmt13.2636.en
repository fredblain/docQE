During a cross-examination Mannings a procedural hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein during that documents to weekly visits to the prison officers Mannings during nine months of prison time had made in Quan, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to reject the indictment, Manning had been punished by the harsh prison time already sufficient - Manning had testified that he had considered the suicide in prison.

In the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning the forms by which officials after their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quan tico-filled in military prison, where he from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced prison conditions for some time.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein questioned him on Friday to the forms, Manning admitted that it is an excellent treatment by his guards as "" and assessed the treatment by the establishment as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so thin, no complaints about mistreatment, although the officials Manning had consulted directly on his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, and the officials have discussed it with him and to deal with them, however, had been recorded.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns)" No problem, "and that meant not necessarily that I said nothing," said Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning asked why he complained about his treatment when he met in January 2011 with a committee to investigate the from him a few months earlier on a form mentioned suicide thoughts.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to downgrade its observation status to "prevention of injury."
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is a step below the suicide risk, and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince people that it was good, and get rid of the observer status on the prevention of injury (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life, from my point of view," Manning said.
From Manning said Thursday on his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before he was transferred in July 2010 in the prison at the naval base Quan tico in Virginia.

Not to know what was happening to him, or in the outside world, was wearing.
"My world fell at Camp Arafjon," to this cage, Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quan, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
It took him only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.

He had always have to sleep with a light that moved from outside into his cell.
If he had turned up at night and see his face guards could no longer, we have awakened him, so he is back again.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer raised a formal objection to the Mannings treatment.
