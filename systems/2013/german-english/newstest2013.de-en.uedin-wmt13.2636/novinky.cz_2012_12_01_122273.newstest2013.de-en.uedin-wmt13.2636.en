"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm only an amateur, Okamura said.
Mr Senator, how do you get the idea to stand for the office of president?
It is not to be me, senator or president.
If everything would work in our country, I would stand anywhere.
But I can no longer find ourselves with the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free, while the people's taxes and the retirement age will be increased.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something I like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm already over 40, and independent and not belong, I have no other way to influence things to run for senator or president.
In the Senate, you have succeeded, and then immediately on the road to the castle.
This does not go back on your constituents?
I told myself all the time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I have clarified it and said that I will be a candidate for the office of president, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my vision.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
But the problem is not only that we as a people ranting in the pub and in front of the TV, but make sure everyone who wants to make a difference.
The media are trying to steal one of the honour and lie to confuse the freedom of speech with freedom.
For example, I was told that I would bribe journalists, or that I was a consultant, Jiří Paroubek.
We are talking about your vision.
The battle for the castle you have included with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective asset declarations about 20 million kroner.
So, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have argued that the travel guide remains a free trade, and it could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, rejected it on purpose, and that is only the population.
As an independent party-less, I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that I can think of no drawers and party dogma of any party to take what is best for our country.
Watch as a human being in politics rather right or left?
From Czech perspective, it seems to me that people see me more to the left.
For me, this right-left thinking, but completely unimportant.
For me, it is important that we can make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or to the right; I would like to connect people.
I always support publicly any good solution, even if it comes from the mutual or by the ODS, and I will turn against bad ideas.
It bothers you, if someone calls you as a populist.
But they acknowledge that not by what you have just said?
If you add in a company with a business plan, then you have an ideal target and a vision.
And you want to approach.
You can call it as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to function in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament only keywords you remain.
And you come in politics in the long term, not far away.
Or do you believe that you, if you talk only long enough with the people, we will be able to enforce the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and to try to convince the public that they bring to our side to achieve these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairman of the parliamentary parties live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to enshrine in law.
And if the Angesprochenen would then have to say why they oppose it.
A strong personality, highlighting abuses, can put pressure on the political scene.
You only need to look at the direct election of the president, who was due to public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy I have only just begun, and try to find my program for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the situation for themselves; and if it doesn't, then I go back in six years in the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura whether the Czech Republic should save.
I am not a savior.
I know that I can do it alone; that is why I have spoken with several famous people about whether they don't want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with Radim Jančura, however, rejected due to overwork.
I also have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová supported, who discovered the fraud in trading, with light heating oil.
My candidacy, I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the eligible voters went to the polls at all, and those who have gone representatives of the establishment, have mostly chosen.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, the direct election of the mayor and district, for example for men.
You think about the establishment of a separate party?
I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to review the past have every potential party member, and not the money.
I have not even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account only 20,000 CZK.
You have no money?
You talk about financial statements, how would you?
I value my private wealth to about 60 million CZK.
"I have a property with a value of about $25 million to 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu yogurt, which is worth about one million for an apartment, and then I have a few million in the account.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked me, as he drove in a car, Galanter on women was, and at the same time, fought against the evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money, you don't want to invest in it.
That is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make about debt?
I have already spent 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program may not have much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will be covered basically through my salary as a senator.
But the senator tight budget, I could not live alone; so I could pay for my son, for example, not the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
Only if I wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
So stay active as entrepreneurs to have your livelihood?
You said that you will go back to these activities?
But that is not linked with the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have reduced my activities in part.
For example, my deputy managing director of the travel office is in the spring.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I still have to live by.
Which monthly income they were used as an entrepreneur?
Some 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As president, I would stop my activities, however.
