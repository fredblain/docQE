The film Argo: Call if about the worst, Hollywood
In November 1979, occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades has maintained the patronage of his regime.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation, they could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would have damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to impose in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the creation of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco everything made in the violent attempt by the hostage liberation even worse.
The captured diplomats have been freed after 444 days after negotiations with the Algerian government had been given.
The fate of the hostages at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat against Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of the film director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that brought the United States a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff managed to escape.
It ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran to bring, helped them an extravagant story for covering their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film, which allegedly locations in the country for a science-fiction movie.
Combination of the genres
The experts for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the cooperation of Hollywood.
The camouflage was credible, seemed to rule on this film project in professional journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, "but also a so-called" Caper Movie, the story of a successful piece (such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels alternate in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs will be shown, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences.
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, ironic and therefore easy to exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table in the office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck did with this film a remarkable start of his career.
From a losing actor has become a respected director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
ARGO his third feature film is the thriller Gone Baby Gone (no breeze, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film Afflecks, which is not in the home of the director of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics that contrasted the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck proves this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada. "
The best scenes in the movie play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck has achieved a similar effect with his team with fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places.
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story is not really a lot in the cinematic sense exciting scenes.
He works with the little but quite successfully, although he is sometimes a bit of reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis is averted at the airport in Tehran by a telephone call in America, or the chase on the runway rather memorably).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is caused by the need to show a lot of action in too many places, too.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood employees is very charming, but their characters would have earned more space, and they are in the film is far from alone.
Afflecks film loses a bit of traction. It is a movie that you have some interest in the design and to a thriller reminiscent of the 1970s retro style down.
He awakens enthusiasm, however difficult.
As a reminder of a day in some way living piece of history and as proof of how excessive are the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is sufficient.
