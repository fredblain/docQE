In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored!
This Thanksgiving unexpectedly, I spent five hours in the airport, when our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts about boredom.
I will not lie.
A half-day waiting at the airport for a flight, is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) available.
But a growing number of academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is, for us and our children okay - to be bored at times.
Thus, the brain is forced to lose themselves in interesting thoughts, which promotes the creativity.
And because most of us stare nowadays almost constantly on the one or other screen, the benefits of boredom benefit us.
Should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes. "
And no.
I come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) that is not so.
"In fact, the boredom" has a very long history, he says.
The house walls beaches like those adorns a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom is there.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom in many species have been identified and discussed.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, "to exert a satisfactory work can be, but not to be able to define it."
Thus boredom differs from apathy to the effect that the person is not working, but would like to be.
The apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two states could be in context, bored people see the problem in their area, or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that we are boring, even if we have just difficult to concentrate.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining boredom in terms of Attention" - earlier: "The idle minds: The definition of boredom in terms of attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, "Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment where participants listened to a tape in which a person was read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring area that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group never heard this noise.
Those who heard the barely audible television, said they would feel more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for them and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task of the disruption of the attention, can lead to boredom, Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study said.
On the other hand, if you put a dreary activity - "as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt can distract music and help to feel not bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and scribble, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, they can fight even by people remain physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually dull - my delayed flight, a roaring speakers, a particularly erm√ºdender film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s, a "vulnerability" scale for long while.
On the scale statements such as "many things I have to do, are monotonously repeated and found" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But, in general, teenagers are in a pretty tough bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents were bored in school and doing the homework, while 23% said to be bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3 percent of parents said they would feel bored.
Professor Larson says later today, 21 years, he does not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
He was, however, confident that the youth "is perceived as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily lives.
So back to my original question: Boredom is healthy?
Sometimes, as in extreme cases, it means that people take extreme physical risks and the gambling or drug-addicted to relieve them, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are examining the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is a professor Vodanovich, who researches the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what you should just do best.
If one is boring and you use that energy to play and to cook, you will be happy.
But television may provide for happiness in the short term, but in the long term they evaporate.
Anyone who reaches his bored child an iPad can distract it from the boredom. It has learned not to entertain themselves or to control, Professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another."
The child learns not just to talk, but also in other areas, more self-control.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Also, we should not see too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to can't us off the constant activity and technology drip.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we should be more boring, but the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful is boredom," he says.
He believes that people are looking for in truth, only for a way to unwind and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly stimulates, it is hard to deal with the noise is silent again."
