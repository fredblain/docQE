The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on charitable work.
That decision provoked a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is that the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital that comes with rampant financial speculation, hand in hand.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) a price tensions.
Under this concept of a state is to understand where the manufacturer is trying to survive by imports of cheaper goods in the economic competition by offering the competition "to grab a larger market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy them cheaply, or give up their business, however, and the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with similarly high labor costs.
Since the private capital has no social responsibility, and thus no responsibility for caused by unemployment, the rising government spending needs.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and replace the society they cause social and economic damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to reduce the social level of its own population and thus artificially to lure foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments deliver its own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly applicable laws in changes.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in terms of wages.
This is partly due to economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by reducing workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany, there is a public food distribution points for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the wake of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases in which workers will receive a wage so low that the state must increase their income by the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures virtually all the EU's southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state where the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance on the margins of society and about whom to hope that at some point, private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, the question naturally arises where this capital?
If it from another EU country, moves only poverty from one country to another, or from the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all the employees are working for a fraction of the European wages.
This affects the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state did not get involved with capital on its own economy, and that planned economy will lead to economic disaster.
The private capital narrowly insists on its position that the state cannot lenkend into the economy.
But then you have to ask whether the private capital not influenced by the politics and the entire state in their own selfish interests or even draws.
Here the clear answer is: Yes.
The proof of the existence of a virtually all-powerful and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, a legislation, in which everything reprehensible, but nothing is punishable by law.
In Germany, the situation is so charged that a State Department private lack of finances, densely entwined with industry law firms with the preparation of draft legislation.
These bills will be passed in the Bundestag.
The violence comes not from the people, as they proclaim the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are currently in a situation like Appian describes it in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompeius': "The state has been understood for a long time in the fall, and the posts were filled with violence.
Against bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.
Corruption proliferated incontinent, and the people had already bought votes in the election... "" people to speak with character applied for posts, so that the state had eight months as a result of this decline any consul... "" You really began with the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation an autocracy, and that a strong man to be elected... "Appian is thought to Pompeius, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, who replaced the democracy permanently by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, is based in today's society, as well as in ancient times on the ruthless preference of his own advantage, not paying attention to societal interests.
The private capital is by its very nature, not for the benefit of the whole of society to recognize and enforce.
The result, now as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites who are not in the least for deeper reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism, we need to look in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Seen from the current state of the sinking of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a pause in which the next round emerges.
Particularly disastrous the fact that today's elites in the future, the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have already witnessed today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance towards.
The repeal of the law on charitable work here is no solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to drive down the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore system.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms, the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of citizens to the government and the monopoly of private capital in the company for the benefit of the state weaken.
