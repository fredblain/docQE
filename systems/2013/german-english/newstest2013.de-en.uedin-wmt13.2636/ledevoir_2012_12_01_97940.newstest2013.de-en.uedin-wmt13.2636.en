Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le DAAD
With its Committee on "death with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of life.
The debate will be resumed in the near future, although a bill is being prepared.
However, in this important area remains to be done.
The DAAD has tried to look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which aufzehrte him, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have managed to seven years," he said, half-heartedly, in his bed at the home for relative Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, it cannot be prepared," he says.
The disease does its work: A vast weakness prevents him from going to the toilet, and even to eat.
On the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees in resignation to help with food.
Bravely manages to smile, and even to talk with the stranger who work around him, give him his medication, and give him a bath.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, since this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this malady.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man standing in the Swedish," says Pierre players, a psychologist at the Home Victor-Gadbois.
Back in the childhood phase for certain people is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept a step backwards, he noted.
Because, according to several people who work in the relative, major events taking place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients, who lived in the home for relative Victor-Gadbois admitted, are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are swamped by the doctors and nurses who care for them, not with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear, "and to die from suffocation."
But the disease, I have really learned to know my children.
"I have" good children, she adds.
"I had no wish more in life, she says, before she accepts that it invokes a mask that helps her to breathe.
In the next few days, there is still a recent visit of her son, who is from Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteer body care and assistance in terms of food intake.
The relative is used when there are no other options.
The deaths.
In Quebec a bed to state residents for the relative.
This is very little, if one takes into account that we will all die one day.
Here, life will continue under the best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying wish, according to an oral-care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Last night we have served Mr X, a beer, who died during the course of the night.
This morning, his son will be finished a beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," nursing director Nathalie Savard reports.
The home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the others.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who will enjoy the last family gathering in the courtyard and well supported by his pillow while on the form, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children died, tragically, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months are three to five beds are occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45 years ago," Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with shares.
53% of "Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to the relative, that is, to a care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients if the latter have reached the final stage of her life, both at home and in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home-Victor Gadbois and the Society for domestic relative in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
These very serious shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the relative specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifesto is in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures in the relative as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all right to a high-quality relative before accepting and euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, no one has taken measures to alleviate.
I fear that the patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions hard until the last day.
The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal, when she broke off an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin that I will break the treatment, she replied that they regret that I am giving up the fight, they said.
However, she had told me that I was at the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff that it has not agreed to this request, have been relieved of their pain by a team of relative.
However, it must be said clearly that the relative is in pain treatment Omni potent.
According to ameliorate Monereau, head of the relative of the society of domestic relative of Montreal 8% of patients to a pain treatment.
At the very end of life, the doctors are often back to the terminal sedation, which amounts to sporadic patients either permanently or asleep by the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is relieved, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, 'I want you asleep me, "but" I want my pain is relieved. "
The realization of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian health research institutes.
