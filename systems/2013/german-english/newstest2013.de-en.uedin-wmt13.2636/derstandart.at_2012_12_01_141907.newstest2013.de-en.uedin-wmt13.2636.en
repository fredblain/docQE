The architects MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books mountain - 2 photos
"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," said Lisette Verhaig, a technician at the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large operation, says: "But, well, it is already the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All of them have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is still in one of these old-style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little visit needy sleeping city on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-resident community has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands.
To counter this stupid circumstance, we decided a few years ago, contributing to the general education and emulate the seven fictional bridges displayed on the euro seem to be pretty bepinselte reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the offensive formation.
And so the city fathers that there is only one way to deal with the statistics, Mr realized: A library to her.
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of great bold bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared on the competition-hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on his face.
And the jury looked nonplussed while still with the armpits and shrugged the cheeky Maas stack, its fine souvenirs of a pyramid and founded aktionistisch ended his speech with the words: "Dear municipality!"
It is, therefore, my proposal for the books mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called boeken mountain!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros expensive mountain built up.
He is part of a revitalization project, which includes an underground car park, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the books mountain was awarded the second prize "best library of NL 2012."
Moreover, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small-town retort that had not so far more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind its white facade, one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, richer for a piece of contemporary architecture.
But especially Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book.
The first impression: Books El Dorado under glass.
There is a lift that leads through the mountains, but the real joy of open space and read the town to climb the topography.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker soil and the elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for park bench, dog and soccer-playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle of a big, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal lies," says winy Maas.
We have asked the classic space configuration on its head and gestülpt the reading area from the inside to the outside world.
The interior of the book's is shrewdly: In the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environment and technology center.
A special pleasure, the black bookshelves, who are facing a wall, sometimes parapet, rose close countries.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even hardcore architects and engineers at the unknown elements offs shake their heads.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," said Joop Trou Borst, project manager for the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we have encountered in a friesländischen holding one day on a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, is used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeter thin plastic woven as root.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile respects, two seasons, then it is ripe for the bulky.
The library was pressed the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP (mountain) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that smells a little after new cars and a little after athletic footwear.
According to 105 degrees is arrived at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long wandering in the cafe will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, particularly the right humidity for literature, but in the mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe, but this house is" despite the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology, Trou Borst says.
Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the books mountain is under a glass of fall, the sun shines even on sunny days, briefly into the interior.
The broad wood glue Binder, who are right on the glass facade serve as shading and catch a large part of the sunlight.
The climate is very pleasant.
The rest of fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptics from the IT industry, already dared the way into the new library.
, Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde that boeken mountain Spijkenisses even as "long overdue soul."
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, everyone residents was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
Thus, the optical gaps should be filled in for the time being, not yet fully-stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept is heartwarming.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," architect winy Maas says.
"I think that thanks to our invitation every residents now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
Thus, MVRDV managed the king discipline, which are called in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
So young and uneducated, they may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
