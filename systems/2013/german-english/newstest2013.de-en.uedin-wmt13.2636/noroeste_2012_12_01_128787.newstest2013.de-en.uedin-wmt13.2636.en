After the appeals court confirmed a ruling by the United States, which recognizes the restructuring of the debt of the group in vitro, which was reached on a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a sinister precedent is being created for each national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
One could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws, in the land of the Stars and Stripes contrary to international agreements no validity.

However, the decision by the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico opens the floodgates to call for tripartite inconsistencies in the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that it is the main method of trade with Mexico in bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures for companies with cross-country profile is not known.
In fact, the model law of the United Nations was created for this purpose for the unification of international trade law, the American Law Institute, was used as a peacemaker.
Secondly, the judgment that the restructuring of the debt would be without the votes of the companies for recognition of the liabilities in the liquidation, which had branches in vitro with its parent company, not the required majority has been achieved.
However, that possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, it is not the first case where this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by a company of the group from the Instituto Federal de National mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Conn courses).
It is true that after deducting the voices of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, which in the courts of the United States against Vitro complained, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, a majority would have achieved.
The outcome of the vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This will be taken into account by the court.
On the other hand, there is blame it for his difficult situation from 2008 as part of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country.
For this reason, the Gonzalez Sada family observed before the same court contradiction, so that the vote in plenary, that is, by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
It is not granted, the Cerciorare-opposition appealed to the review of the process by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The severity of this case is that the court had a document, which was sent by the government of Mexico under the amicus curiae Figura (friend of the court), in which the vitro procedure is described in the framework of the law on trade Conn courses, and what pointed out that it had adhered strictly to the agreements signed by the two countries to meet the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law in the United States.
It also pointed out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for the cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee the equality between debtors and creditors.
