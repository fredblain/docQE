Birth in space
In danger.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with Erdbewohnern aboard are on the search for a replacement.
To save humanity, the important question of how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the spare planet?
There are many choices, in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
Indeed, "Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of Astronomisches Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
While the conditions on Mars, however, are relatively pro-life, a temperature of 500 degrees exists on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, possible in space.
The question of reproduction in space, the researchers treated first with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before that were carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of in-orbit bred peas was not in the least of the species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects,) of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila, in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It is a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicken stop must find; it needs to be able to stand on its feet and start to move," says the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid surface the chicks in the wild.
Ten hours later, stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
Four days later, she died then.
"We have lost twice chicks hatch and then abandoned it, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew for the failed experiment is sticking with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years in orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments are continuing.
But will the Bion Biosatelliten "" are only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space in already.
In principle, there was nothing special.
"It was just the Biosatelliten, but it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," said Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing of the space rats offspring.
The issue of reproductive directly in space could be resolved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are taken from their natural habitat, can simply follow their reproductive driving.
Unlike animals, humans could in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations such experiments are carried out.
But women already fly into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk for Tereshkova.
The most precious that owns the humanity, is the female body.
The gull flew, and no one on earth would be able to answer the following question: Is it the space flight?
Will it bring after this flight a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered that question," space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse says.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan permissions, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja gave birth, which was twice in orbit, and even Shakespeare work outside the space vehicle, a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where everything went after long flights, and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Poliakov quite rightly, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity needs for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The Hydro-lab in preparation for the cosmonauts is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.
Here in limbo, the cosmonauts routine to win the work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but infants water as a natural element.
It is the small Ichtyander, would testify that life in the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly of the amniotic fluid, and that it may be easier to get used to water.
In principle, it is logical, from birth to pass for the first swimming just two weeks ago.
"This is too little time to forget about something," baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa says.
While a newborn child for the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman cannot function without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the stomach and pelvis muscles is enormously back quickly and thus also decreases the ability to extract the child.
Well, we do this by birth, a senior aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber, squeezing the child.
"But what happens then?" Is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poliakov quite rightly.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
To feel the gravitational pull of earth, the organism can train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child is in orbit, not as an adult to be put into a pressure suit.
It is simply that missing, which is vital for his life.
"This experiment, which together make, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled person, a completely unangepassten people bring to the world," says the director of the bioethics commission of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory.
At some point, it becomes a reality, however, if the people in their space ships leave to a distant planet, which is the home for the All-born offspring.
