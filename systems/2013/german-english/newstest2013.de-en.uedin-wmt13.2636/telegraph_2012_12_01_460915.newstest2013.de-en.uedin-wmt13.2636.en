Petro nella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford, because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views.
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once held for the largest temple in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the major pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance promoted.
But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester College in the late 1980s, where I had intended to study history - I had packed up my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said that I would be gone, because I had a problem with fellow students have had sex in neighbouring rooms.
The author of A N Wilson said rogue, I would have to leave the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth, however, was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
They had harassed me for one reason only - a reason that appeared in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment so parochial and cruel: My late father since Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, the latest reports indicate that a new generation of students from the center-right suffers from a similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same protection of equality, gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are isolated because of their political views, "often active, attacked personally and for undesirable explained."
They call for a place in the equality committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
The situation has been exacerbated by a recent broadcasting documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories represented as a cemetery and neo-Nazis.
It has been shown, among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student union of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and silver suit and silver occupied prelude, walking stick.
Conservative students at other universities say they are regarded as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student union of the University of Nottingham, in a Sunday newspaper said: "There is a growing trend left at universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, having met without us at all. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect the conservative student association of Oxford, says they have at JRC members of a growing opposition to students of the center-right.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and it is for the well-being of the members," says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I was part of a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I was in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted in favour of Margaret Thatcher, a former student - as a result of cuts in higher education to give an honorary title.
The atmosphere would have even wake up Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester-week, new students and tutors come to know, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors the mockery of Tory students not only no real opposition, but even with joy in it.
Political issues, such as the miners' strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
My first of these events, I should translate French 18th-century texts into English. On what was to come, I had not been taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "you translate the first paragraph."
, I stumbled.
Pitt, a small man with a face like from pie dough, and rather be horrendous.
"Refuse Thatcher supporters, French to learn, or are they just stupid?" He asked me.
The other students giggled.
To wallten tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that they take in your spare time a few French hours - that is, if you are not too busy with your social activities," to her like Pitt.
I returned to my room with hanging head back.
On that evening, I sat alone in college at the dinner, when someone typed me slightly on the back.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is how it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, is being harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most of the Tory first semester, supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to block me.
I insisted that I was not in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics and economics, who had visited, ironically, the force as a conservative Richard College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dangerous.
"As Tories sex?" One asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt as homosexuals have had before the more liberal legislation have felt like the United States.
Would I ever be able to lead at Oxford University a normal life?
I would like-minded meeting only after nightfall?
If I turn to the Labour Party and my natural inclinations to suppress?
The three years that lay before me, spread in front of my mind into a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who announced himself openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
He was not only hated for it to be a conservative, but also because he advise Thatcher in terms of foreign policy, and they had written speeches.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I started to move between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in taken were accepted all political views.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my Communist friends always impeccable manners demonstrated.
His moist eyes marred.
"Give it a chance.
I am sure that you just pouty.
It would break the heart, if you gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had the pressure to tamper with his convictions unholy.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, where another history tutor had claimed seriously, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I was, too, that my parents had to undergo a "brainwashing" and called them "old idiot."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who was the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford's career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes of my HÃ¤scher tasks.
When they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a startling wines repeated.
But no 18-year-old should ever in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice.
And even more tragic is that it was an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory prime minister produced, but still behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
