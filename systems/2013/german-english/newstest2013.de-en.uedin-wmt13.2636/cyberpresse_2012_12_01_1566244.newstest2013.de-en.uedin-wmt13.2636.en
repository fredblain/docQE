The Higgs quantum analysed
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs Bosons last summer, has caused a stir, and with good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this quantum state is involved in nothing less than the mechanism for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And, finally, is the last particle predicted by the Standard Model whose existence - our best or "least wrong" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but not yet observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs quantum state.
Moreover, it seems to be confirmed by new data, which this week on a large physics-congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data, in order to be completely safe.
We are still working on the assumption that it is indeed the Higgs, apparently because there is only a small risk to deceive themselves, and we take a look at what is at stake.
In this world, there is a necessarily inevitable law, that means that two objects may not be in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not too much, because you are hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it is also such a law: The Pauli exclusion principle, "which says that two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they find themselves in the same" quantum state, "but this" condition is "largely from some of their properties.
On this basis, the physicists a share the particles in two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are described as Fermione and suddenly the obey.
And in another move the boson, a nasty gang of anarchists, for whom nothing is sacred, certainly not this principle, which means that they can be in fact, at the same time in the same place.
These bosons are divided according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: The meson, which we will not deal with the "strength and particle," by which the great forces of nature and spread the Higgs quantum somehow related.
However, it must be stressed that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, as one might think.
If you are able to read these chronicle, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The Photon, or the "light particle," which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electric charge is accelerating or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field precisely in this place, "disturbed" is, like a pebble, who was thrown into a pond.
Through these "disorder an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc."), and this wave is nothing more than a publicity, and thus one of the boson "carrier of the force."
More stable field
The same is true for the Higgs quantum state, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, "" must be disturbed, so that this quantum state.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus needs to very high energy, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks but could be.
Therefore, a giant like the CERN particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - to achieve that kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again help to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets are doing this, but others do not, for example, would never think of a sheet of paper on the refrigerator.
And not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while the other (as a result) no mass.
But for all this research can now be good, "Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to study all the differences between the observations and predictions of the SM.
There are also a number of physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could be a door to a "new physics" open and plug some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter is still major deficiencies, because there is no explanation of the force of gravity (ups!) and offers dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (re-ups!).
However, such differences were not found at the CERN until now.
Impact of
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be none.
By the way: In the early 1960s were the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories not believed that their work would trigger such a revolution.
You saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and was developed in 1962, the first time line were the first laser (NI), said that the laser was seen at the beginning rather than a "laboratory gimmick."
Just imagine...
It also can arise applications from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle, in turn, has developed in 1969 during his work at a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose of the sensor, all digital cameras around the world today as "eye" and have earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that we can never really know it...
