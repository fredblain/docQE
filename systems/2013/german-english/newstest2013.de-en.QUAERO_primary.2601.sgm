A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
However, the Brennan Center for, the latter is a myth, and that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The attorneys for the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States,, only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In this sense, some of these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
In contrast to Canada, the united states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, has announced new laws to make it difficult for the procedures for the registration or.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which the new Republican representatives in 26 states.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The new election laws that require voters to present photo identification and proof of citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In addition, these laws also shorten the period for early voting, the to register as voters on election day, and denied citizens the right to vote, for which a court.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Before the elections of 2006, no US state has asked voters to present photo identification.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in the year 2008.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Over the last two years, to in 34 states, which forced the voters to produce photo identification.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to do not unlike Quebec on a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In fact, 11% of US citizens, 21 million people no photo identification issued by a governmental authority of their state.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to get the required identification.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected low-income young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo identification.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
This goes further.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The students who are seen as voters increasingly cast their votes for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo id issued by The establishment.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs, which is On the Republican side, to the cards issued by these clubs to use for elections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Before 2004, no state has asked for proof of citizenship for voting.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Arizona was the first federal state, who introduced such a requirement.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
These measures are clearly, to limit the Hispanic votes.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states laws, with the registration of voters on election day.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
These restrictions are not without consequences.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the voter registration in the 2004 general election to register some 10 million citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
In addition, the Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws, which aim to shorten the period for early voting.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
For example, in the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance, African-Americans, even though they represent only 13% of voters in the state.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The same is true of the Hispanic population.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
In contrast, the White, 76% of the voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Of course, the democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
They were able to limit the damage.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the of a photo ID.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
The Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the 2012 key states.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted laws, which make up 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college, in order to win the presidency.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
In this sense, some of these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.

Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The test, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This leads to a greater reluctance of men already undecided for the implementation of screening tests.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The test should be made or not?
</seg>
<seg id="5">
We have the opinion of two doctors.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
In the studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret the data and to give clear recommendations.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
This study has also shown that a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher if no screening was carried out.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
There is also a higher risk For men African-American origin.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer was identified.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There are cancers that, the aggressive and others, they are indolent.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The patients must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer by pointed out the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate cancer, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and will be in this case for an active surveillance of the disease.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Today, many of the men, in which the cancer detected no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and those who do not.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be done or not.

<seg id="19">
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

To prevent the disease
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eating well and would move enough.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"If there is no more smoking, this would rise at least to 50%," says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
However, it is estimated that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Several remain completely unknown.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
It greatly damages the health of the people.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The weight
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
They seem to have the risk of breast, colon, rectal,,, and cervical cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer during the entire life," he adds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
The diet
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In, it increases the risk of a Grimm or rectal cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Sausages should be avoided.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
The preservation of meat by smoking, or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Vitamins
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
At present, but Their investigations are not conclusive.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
While a study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also has not yet clear.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
In addition, Mr Beaulieu, how important it is to talk with his doctor about his concerns and his family history.

The Higgs boson analyzes
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The announcement of the possible discovery of the has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It is believed that the boson is nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And, finally, it is the last of the standard model particle whose existence - our best or the least wrong "explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - has been observed, but not predicted by.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
But for physicists, it is not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the standard model Higgs boson.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data yet to be completely secure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
We assume that it is indeed the Higgs is wrong, because apparently only a small risk to, and let us look at what is at stake.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
There is an inevitable law that in this world that can be two objects at the same time, in the same place.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not to, because you are hurt.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles can occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same quantum state "," and "on the whole, consists of some of its properties.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The physicists share the particles into two categories.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In one corner are the good citizens, who are referred to as and the Pauli principles.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And in the other the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, whom nothing is sacred, not in any case, this principle, which means that they can indeed be at the same time, at the same place.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
These bosons are divided according to the website the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Mesonen, which we will not deal with here and the "," the great forces of nature and the Higgs boson, which would be.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
It must be stressed, however, that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, such as one might think.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
If you are able to read this, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the photon, or light particles, "the" messenger "of the electromagnetic force.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
If a particle with an electric charge accelerates or change the direction of, the electromagnetic field is in this place "disrupted" like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In this "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "of the force."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
More stable field
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The same is true for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, must be "disrupted" Higgs field, so that the boson.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface could be a very large rocks spall.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
That is why a giant particle accelerator is - as CERN's Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - In order to achieve the kind of energy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It is not, in fact, all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - for example, a piece of paper would never in the refrigerator.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the other (such as the photon) have no mass.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
What all this research can be "good", asks Mrs Plamondon?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
For the science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the to.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
There are many physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference to open a door to a "new physics" and could fill some holes of the model.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It must be said that the latter still major shortcomings, there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (again ups!).
</seg>
<seg id="32">
However, the CERN such deviations were not found until now.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Impact
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The impact of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs that their work would trigger such a revolution.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and even in 1962, the first (were the first gepulst) - has already said that the laser at the beginning, rather than a "laboratory gimmick".
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Imagine...
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
In addition, there are also from all the instruments that surround the research.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in optics, has developed a small light sensor.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Although it was not the original purpose of the sensor is now all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...

Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which has been signed by prominent figures of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec the health system is not enough to ensure that all of the right to have a high-quality palliative care before accepting move to euthanasia.

<seg id="51">
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, with its has taken measures to alleviate.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I am afraid that the patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions hard until the last day.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has broken off a difficult chemotherapy.

<seg id="55">
When I told my oncologist that I will break the treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told them.

Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff, that it is not granted this wish, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
But it must be said that the palliative care in pain treatment is not.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
After Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care of the society of domestic palliative care of Montreal 8% of patients do not speak to a pain treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
At the very end the life of the doctors rely so often terminal sedation, which the patients either sporadically or permanently to the time of his death.

We can no longer act as if We do not perceive this side of the suffering.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Patients without pain relief will have the opportunity to the terminal sedation.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Patients whose pain is not all say the same sentence: "I want to die."

<p>
<seg id="2">
In this season, you have a new deal with PSG.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
How do you explain this progress?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Great players.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Every day I am on their side.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The technical staff gave me a lot.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
These factors spur me every day to improve my game.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And in a game that is even easier.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In football, everything is going very quickly.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
But I must stop in enthusiasm.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my game time at Saint Etienne I have always made gradual progress.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
They make the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The new entrants this summer are used to make a very high levels.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They also know that every training session.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This means that a player like me, the forehead and wants to give his best.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my game.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is supported by other such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Of course.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Ancelotti breathes all technicians respect.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches In Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He had contact with great players.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
I think he will win another title in Paris.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The trust that he has put in me, it is also an explanation for my services.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
What do you think about the first part of the season for PSG?
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the us.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
We are in the ambush.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the World Cup in this way.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
We will try to get as far as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
From now on, everything is possible.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
However, we will have our say, a very good European teams.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
First of all, we want to be the First of our group in Porto, so that we can deliver the return leg of the final home game.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
The PSG can become a major European club in the short term?
</seg>
<seg id="39">
He has already in the budget for it...
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win the title and make a name for the long term.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
This is not the case today.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The PSG is financial resources, so that this project is taking shape.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
It would be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
This year, it is really important to us, the of This title.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In the last season we were close.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
We have finished with 79 points.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Normally, you should be with 79 points...
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I believe that this year is the right one.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
</seg>
<seg id="55">
In view of what has been invested, and the players we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
We fully accept that.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
If we win, with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us, that is frustrating.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
One wonders what people expect.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
We are not the FC Barcelona.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
We are trying to set up a game plan.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
A team builds over time.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, fails to qualify for the final, and also has made huge spending.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
In terms of the sums invested was believed to break with 15 points ahead.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season of this new PSG were good, "geboostet."
</seg>
<seg id="68">
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.

<seg id="69">
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling winner and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties.

The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
The better that you speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
</seg>
<seg id="72">
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.

We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.

As it was also Laurent Blanc.

But I would not like to make a comparison.

In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as convertible, a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
With 15,000 computers in the network has already been about 200,000 transactions.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or payment.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
After the price of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to 2 dollars, before he recovered to about ten dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the global trade of real currency or financial products.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "," which are used to make progress in a video game by winning games or buy (and sometimes).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.

<seg id="13">
However, the trade is controlled and managed by a central authority.

With Bitcoin are all at the same time, money network nodes repositories of the accounting book, auditors, and buyers and sellers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
How does this network?
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address, which ensures the anonymity.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A number of the data associated with this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
With the help of the content of the file is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the accounting book in the entire network of public accounts are available.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The crucial step is to sign this new deal in this book.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
This is a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add This additional line.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It is a carving up the file, i.e., the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The computer, "" the new transaction and add a number of before the whole thing "."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The goal is to find the that number, which is a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
</seg>
<seg id="26">
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
If a user wants to very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without a link, since both have different fingerprints.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The computer, which has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012.

The Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but up to one hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre....

"The weakness is not the," Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin.

Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.

Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt

It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily divided the unlimited power of more than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly on its final version, the next day.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work to the House.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Egypt is based now for almost two years on a temporary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This new initiative has a for an even stronger division of the country.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
For his opponents, the president in his "autocratic delirium" is "by breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
On the side of his supporters are assured that it is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A very short period of time, which is forcing the brothers to give up their project, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
For the president, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest raging across the country.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In an interview with the American Wochenschau Time seems to have to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Given that the Egyptian people with this to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution is supposed to end.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent assembly approved the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The majority of the has not complied with the request.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have, because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Representatives from human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
To achieve the quorum yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members added.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... the time has come for the prayer, because some members of the panel were of the opinion that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The text, which was last night, consists of 234 articles.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Article 2, which drew all the attention, after all, identical to that of the 1971 constitution states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped, "the principles" by "the rules," which would have made a stricter application.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed, a proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"Hypocrisy" of the liberals, who see it as propaganda.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
According to the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
They are particularly Article 220 in the eye of the Al-Azhar University, which awards an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because "the people who are being asked to, have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The fears of the Liberals also fed by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"There is currently no specific religious commitment.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no Ulema, but academics, who have been trained in the French system, "appeased Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But he admits that "in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity may be, because the terms of the religious vocabulary.

<seg id="37">
It is in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence Red.].
</seg>
<seg id="38">
And in the future could be raised the question of civilian judges are competent to decide. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday sharply because of the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that these are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will be submitted to Parliament, but a national defence council.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
There will be no ban on civil trial in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The latter also share their concerns with regard to the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, underscores Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
They say that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
This word was not included in the previous constitution.

</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Above all, spokesman for the migration authority, it is to reduce the number of forced laborers.

<seg id="20">
"Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representation of the federal immigration authorities in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Their rights, however, must be protected before their departure.

Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably encounter people with bad intentions, which is under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he met with dozens of his peers months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day.

We are receiving many complaints from our migrants.

However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, too, that they do not know not only the language of the country, but also in their own language to express in writing.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Of course, that is not so much their fault, but rather the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can only afford a sound basic education.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy decent clothes, shoes and school.

Civil rights activists say the following important aspect of the law.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The test only migrants with legal status.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
If you do not have this status, there is no and, consequently, no official work.
</seg>

Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.

</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, The linguistic difficulties.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
In addition, the legalisation of costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

The staff of the Russian police know that our documents and we are not registered, and then to cases of blackmail.

"Spare no expense for false papers."

</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
On the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Some counterfeit certificates, the completion of the language tests, have already been by members of the federal Migration Agency.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant, who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: It costs a three thousand rubles.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
That is the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates can be bought, both officials and civil rights activist.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers, who are covered by the test for the first time, that you get time for a language course.

In addition, new arrivals without language skills will be offered in areas where no active communication with people.

The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-profit organizations.

In addition to the increase In the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.

A typical Walmart employee who earns 9.5 dollars an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.

According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.

We are trying to change the work on real three-dimensional display systems based on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
We have to lay off the computer world in our physical world and make them more.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
To this end, it is important that not only the user, but also its surroundings.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Then we could add to the real world much easier to virtual objects.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
And the first and foremost, we should be of virtual reality helmets!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
- What do you think of voice?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It is popular, but It will not be overrated?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
- It is certainly not the solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because they do not like to inform all others about its actions and intentions.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular niche.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
For example, we worked in the area of the management of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight, with sprawling gestures.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but by a bracelet registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It is still relatively large, but in theory, could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
But overall, the future belongs to, for example, gestures and language.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
- Like that?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
For example, We would ask me to reach out to you this?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
They say it and, at the same time.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
- Normally, I will say it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
- That you want the user adapt to what can be a machine at the time and what is not?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
I think that we in the near future, in particular on the development of new types of sensors, which make it possible to the people.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The laser sensors, for example, could be because they are in the depth of a good resolution, which is very important.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
- What do you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
</seg>
<seg id="37">
There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Of course, would not be 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
So all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The speed and the number of frames per second are important.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Stephen Betishes in our lab in Redmond, developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Not all understand how much it affects the interaction between man and machine.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
I needed for my work as a device, only without the control and with more images per second.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
- Would not be increased the number of cameras?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras," one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
And the third camera is actually a RGB camera.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
It is not used to calculate the object.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
More cameras could possibly solve the problem.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Or the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
It would be nice, to a flexible, system in which we could play with different camera tendencies to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, his glasses, not the public.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life, the lens has the best prospects?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
- Of course, it is not pleasant, always on the way to keep a smartphone in your hand, but I think the following: the best option would be a "temporary" augmented reality in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone,
</seg>
<seg id="58">
The lens is a personal and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but at the same time its weakness, because an enlarged reality through glasses that you can work together with others in virtual objects.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air, not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
There is a problem that critics often point out of this idea: There is no tangible response.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
The hands feel nothing at all.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
What answers to give your group at this point?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough In the interaction between man and machine.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as somewhat unusual projection.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It takes pressure!
</seg>
<seg id="67">
But there are also technologies that are on the "pictures in the air" to give something, for example, the interference of some ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger, a feeling, but that is still so weak as someone on the.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
There are also bands for the wrist, on the nerve endings in the fingers, it is also a potential direction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">
- Have you tried to outflank the brain?
</seg>
<seg id="70">
We think that it can feel what it should feel if it sees something?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">
- This is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
Here is another challenge facing us that we will have to fight for a long time, is that people who are physically in a closed room to believe,, it is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in the), mobile platforms and large balls.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
So far, the brain can only moderately, and we still have many busy years of work.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
It is that makes the work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: in many issues, we are only at the beginning.

My own taste of culture - rosbalt.ru
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Rosbalt, the project "Petersburg avant-garde," which is dedicated to city dwellers, who are the vanguard of the art and culture.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
On the list already landed high-ranking representatives of the art scene, whose successes beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without having to be known in the rest of Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, dressed in red at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden,, or at openings.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are always issued, they attract large crowds.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg philosophical artist, the new myths.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the streets and a smile to the faces of his fellow citizens with them for a good mood.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg barrel organ player, as it is for this difficult role in terms of its, its philosophy and its image finally ready.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
- Kirill, why are you always in red and turquoise or yellow, for example, in the city?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In this world red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In the society of, which differs from the norm, aggression and bad behavior.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But I want my provocations with the people.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
- When did you know that you have to become a painter?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
- In an exhibition in the Palace of Culture, in my work.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I realised that I have to go down this path.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter at the time, and new and free painters as I was incomprehensible.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
I am with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was a "Pushkinskaya 10," and then once was.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
It takes me to the theatre, fashion, music, to everything, except the literature.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
- And all the united in your kind clinic... - it was important to me to be at the heart of the culture, where the best creative artists should meet.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovation a club for the Boheme, the house of the.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember how cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and was one of the composer Igor Wdowin today.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
When the group began to play live, was from the "Leningrad".
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Mountain moderated many programs before the era of "Halli Galli."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
We gave them, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Our employees and guests.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In the year 2000, there was a survey in the press, "people of our city."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"I won in the category of" artist of the year, and so I had arrived at the peak.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
It is not easy to work in new times, according to the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
- Your work has a distinctive style.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and make clear the timeliness and sharpness of thought.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
I will have an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as a clown."
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Clowns are timeless.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
I was socially, but now it hurts and is to be so.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
In a clown obliterated everything and loses his tragedy.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
For example, we save the world by stipulating that everyone has to dress up.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Now everyone is the clothes and is based on the outside and not on the inside of the people.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
But perhaps we should not be a human hand, but he should spit in the face.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The deception disappears through The.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A cultural city should have a hero.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Who, if not I?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
- Commercial art can be beautiful?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
- Commercial art must be careful, thoughtful and flattering.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Large groups of people In the past: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
I am not a one-hundred-dollar note each.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Now you have to think about whom you will like.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
- Come to the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
- Women abandoned him, the social sphere plays a role.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
In my youth, I have painted these pictures, which hung with a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
This is the culture that I support.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">
- What is missing Kirill Petersburg?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
- Good cultural experts.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
They say: Servant of the culture.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
But not all of them can deal with culture.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
In the real tsars, it was different, because the tsars did not a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
In St. Petersburg, we have what might be the experts, but they will be the way, as it requires hochrangigerer experts is that the former correctly assess and pave the way for them.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
Now, only their own taste.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must find other museums.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">
- What is for you?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural Capital in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
On our stones art is difficult to grow up.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
We are much less.
</seg>

Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.

"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.

Chief: control of the black system failed due to the fault of politics
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts good bodies and adequate laws, but falls in their application.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
In the interview for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the board of control (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that this is not the case," said Kala, the current situation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
A similar result is A common control by Czech and German.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
He has the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas example As a bad practice, the so-called "black system."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
The Prime Minister said Recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls, the system is prohibited or allowed?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then the chairman of the government simply cannot come, and the control Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work," Kala.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a common Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries were compared with each other on public contracts.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
What did it?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
It is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature determines how to handle public contracts. The national legislation. And finally, there is the real practical application.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
All of this, we have compared with each other, and although the review is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences, generally speaking, the laws are perhaps a little "strict and perfect, but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
This confirms that it is not enough to draw up new and more detailed rules. You have to deal with the actual application of the law.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
How can you help? What is for you from this project?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
It is precisely such a joint control could help us that we stop a perfecting of laws and the reduction and balance thresholds, if this does not seem particularly positive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to buy and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
It may even be the case that the system in this way only with excessive paperwork "," and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
How does the control system in Germany?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Is there a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
As far as the authorities, the German equivalent to the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us, and also has a college, which is only slightly different. In principle, but authorities both the same.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, a federal state, which means that there is this in the individual states - in the German system is different from ours.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The BRH can only control federal funds, which is in our state funds.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Public funds are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the courts.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
As far As the German legislation is easier than ours?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
In general, I would compare this reluctant without specific details. However, in some ways, Germany is often described as a model, but you cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
That is because the auditors are better?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
That is not, but as I don't particularly like, such comparisons.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It should be noted that even those countries which are a model for us, also have to contend with problems.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, Or?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
With regard to the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority, the revision of the law you feel any impact?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Given that this is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests so far.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
After the our controls, you have to rely on a certain delay.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
We feel so far in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts examined and analysed, the changes will have an impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions have been modified for certain types of of.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will be charged with more bureaucracy?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
It may occur, however, the problem is that the rules will be "tougher" and can no longer be met.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Under the previous rules are, in a way to the winner (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) accountable that any breach of the law is a violation of budgetary discipline.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
But it is to make the law more stringent?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
I do not believe that in this way.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not to punish those who have, which made a formal does not affect the actual decision-making.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
Where is the solution?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
We say first of all, what is not.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with control of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The system is now banned or allowed?
</seg>
<seg id="49">
A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then the chairman of the government simply cannot come, and the control Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
He can say: "we change the law and allow the thing," but He cannot say that we do so, as if nothing would be.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain events - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer will be excluded because of procedural.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied right - and that is what is missing in my opinion.

What do you think about it, that is to take place in less than a month of the world?

In December, you also have a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Can you imagine the project to our readers?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
It is a national fundraising event, which we have been planning two years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is projected for 21 December at 11: 10 am in the end of the.
</seg>

The day before, that is, on 20 December, from 21: 00 at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.

Who is from this idea?

<p>
<seg id="12">
Originally from me, then we have developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In doing so, we would not only to collect enough positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to consider, together with the public about the state of the world to our children.

The band the Tap Tap has, together with other performers, the so-called anthem against the world, with the title "of the world."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The anthem is very popular on YouTube. It will resound to the charity concerts?

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
Of course, in the end, provided that everything works and the end Of the world does not take place.

The anthem should be sung by all the performers at all three concerts at the same time.

How did you come to work with both?

We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, which is to the fact that We realize many charity events and concerts.

We are trying to integrate these people in our projects.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
For the establishment of the education center Studeo, in which we are already six years with the club in the Jedlička Institute.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The students of The Jedlička Institute are cared for by editors who help them with different leisure activities.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
As the students themselves do not have the resources to go to the editors, we want to help them in this way.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is intended to create a separate building in which we with this project.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
At every concert, several groups and performers.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
What criteria do you have chosen?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In Prague, for example, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Similar "big events" are planned for the future?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
We also want to be like Next year in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Their overseas plans are not small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
How do you manage these journeys logistical and organisational?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. We must also, of course, many instruments suitcase and other luggage...
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems, SA and British Airways were always been very well prepared for us, that I have been surprised sometimes.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
By your foreign travel you have a settlement in the various countries with accessibility, as there are people with disabilities, etc.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
How have you seen these things so far?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were in Russia, that is still in its early days in the East.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
In Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, it is still unusual, if someone is in a wheelchair in the city centre.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
It is not obvious that It is in a wheelchair user, for example, of course, in the elevator.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Fortunately, there are clubs try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
There are still many things on which we are...
</seg>
<seg id="53">
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of those concerned.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities independently in the public space, go to the museum, you can use toilets etc.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
But it is not usual for a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social activities, we are with the band the Tap Tap the West a little ahead.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but it is only one of our ranks meaning athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really begin to change.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly determined personalities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: what motivated in 1998 to create a band?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people, who were interested in dealing with.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
And since I am a musician And saxophone playing, among other things, along with a colleague, I have a music AG.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
Oh, and at the time, as our, Láa Angelovi, likes to say, a little out of control (laughs).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
The band became known, but only in the last few years, I am wrong?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us, and we have also started to advertise for us.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
We are aware that if you are and that it is not to the outside world, its own performance in a certain sense, does not exist.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
Thanks to EU funding, we can also be good editors, and quality equipment and the like.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
Was it your goal to get there with The Tap Tap so far?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">
From the beginning I felt the potential that we can do things differently.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
In the show business often copied to the other.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
This is logical in its own way, as new with caution and will be accepted only after a long time.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
The first impression that The audience is, of course, it is only natural.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
But this compassion is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature, we would have to regret.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
There are people who live a full life and can develop, they have the necessary resources.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
I always say that if people with disabilities can do something, not just for them, it is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a tough boss, as we hear from many people?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">
If you want to make something good, there is no compromises on many things, and also need to a certain discipline.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
But I think this is completely normal.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they that they have twice a week, prepared phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the enthusiasm quickly extinguished.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
How it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">
Currently, The Tap Tap twenty members.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
How many of them were from the outset, i.e. since 1998?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
We are an open group. People come and go, That you can prevent.

Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.

Poland and the space.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Last week, Poland was as a member of the European Space Agency at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which took place on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Poland began in 1994 close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and took part in the following years several ESA projects.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The path of Poland into space, however, began much earlier.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Even before the Second World War Polish space in the space, and they do not always met with understanding.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I would remind you of the lecture by A. Šternfeld 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, for example, in which the author thought from his pioneering work "entrance to the Outer Space Exploration."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905), the audience cold, and after years ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the Outer Space Exploration" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been by, among other things, that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
In the year 1925 in Poland, a railway trolley was built, a rocket was planned.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or the brakes of the trolley.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The research, the Institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is clear From the documents show that the research was to the stage of practical tests.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
In 1937, appeared in the press of the draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, the "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology from the scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work by his work was the beginning of the war.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Another article on space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrt (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The first mention of this company 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in which four major articles devoted to the space travel.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains The proposal to set up a space company.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At the time, there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
At its inception in 1956, the PTA Polish aerospace company founded in 1951 to join the International Federation for space, and indeed, in the autumn of 1956, the PTA was already.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In the following year became the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The office he held until his death in 1959.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Since 1956, the PTA took part in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built, and 1959 in the bledowska desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
A further stage of development should be able to provide real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and come for the observation of high-altitude winds.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In 1962, but the development has been.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Successor to the first missiles of the type RM was developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and The weight was 32.5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
This has developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which are from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area with 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and 0.62 litres.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The maximum altitude of all three types of 37 km.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
In the years 1965 to 1968, was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg, at a height of about 60 km.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
It is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, after two years later, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in the space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second.

The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Last week, the constitutional court of the law on charitable work.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
That decision in a lively discussion in the public.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It is interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The liberal oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free, free movement of private capital, with rampant financial speculation goes hand in hand.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Under this concept is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper goods in economic competition, "in order to grab a larger market share by the competition" and to increase its profits.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Private capital is no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rise in unemployment caused, the government spending.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This situation is compounded by the fact that, the men are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the overall economic and social damage.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are here.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In other words: governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The aim of these measures is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
This is done through economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, by the rights of workers.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In Germany, there are for several years, public food distribution for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The number of people who are already in the millions.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive such low wages that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of the German Bundestag auxiliary staff employed in the.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The austerity measures of practically all eu southern states will be on the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate, under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels (as in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society, and to hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Here is the question of where this capital?
</seg>
<seg id="26">
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the European wages.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
This applies to all of Latin America.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam, that the state should not be capital in its own economy, and that a planned economy will lead to economic disaster.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The private capital is on his position that the state should not interfere with in the economy.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Then you have to wonder whether or not the private capital, the policy, and the entire state in its own selfish sense or even.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Here is the clear answer: yes.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual unmistakably, practically everything in the legislation, but nothing is punishable by law.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department for lack of finance private, dense with industry of with the development of law.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
All the violence is no longer from the people, as the western nations, but by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Obviously, the liberal democracies have been in a situation that the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and ': "the state has long been in decay, and the offices were occupied by force.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Against bribes, illegal bequiles of benefits or with stone and sword.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Corruption has grown, and the people with already bought votes went to the polls... "" people with character not applied for as a result of this decline for eight months, so that the state had no consul... "" you really began to talk about it, that is the only medicine an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man... "Appian thought to be elected, but the strong man was, democracy permanently replaced by the.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
As it turns out, today's society is based, as well as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, not paying attention to the interests.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to see the advantage for the whole of society.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are, not in the slightest for deeper reforms.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we must in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The current state of affairs, the of these regimes can be seen as a certain pause in favor of liberal democracies, in the next round.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The is the fact that today's elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution, at least not lasting.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the level of social security of the population.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
This trend is therefore systemic.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in the company in favour of the state.

The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or these (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, with in the meantime, the central bank of the of Russia's government has).

The first war was aimed at eliminating the big royalist states to the second war, in particular, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and its luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the apron) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power.

This change in the film, the Stimmungs levels - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence showing iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).

<seg id="21">
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, therefore, the ironic and slightly exaggerate.

Ben Affleck is a remarkable restarting his career with this film.

Argo is his third feature film, the thriller No (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).

At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in Boston by the director.

The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the previous films from the director of the Hollywood standard.

<seg id="28">
Affleck is this sense, but also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The best scenes of the film in the streets and the reconstruction of events that have taken place - the sequence of the storming of the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and yet conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when the story.

The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer many exciting scenes in cinematic terms.

<seg id="33">
But it has been working With the little, and sometimes he nachhilft reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or the chase on the runway, some of the).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is due to the need to show too much to act in too many places.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, their characters but deserved more space, and that they are not in the film by far from alone.

Afflecks film it loses a little traction. It is a movie that, with some interest and the design and to a thriller from the age of 70, retro style.

Mr Senator, how to get the idea to run for the office of the president?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
It is not for me to be a senator or president.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
If everything would work without any problems in our country, I would not be.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But I can no longer see the republic plundered for 20 years, as thieves walk free, while increasing people's taxes and the retirement age.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
But when I see something that I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
And while I am over 40, and independent and party-less, I have no other way to influence things, to stand as a candidate for the office of a senator or president.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
In the Senate, you have done it, and then on the road to the castle.

<seg id="10">
You do not turn your constituents?

I said to have the whole time that I will take up the fight for the castle on the outcome of the elections.

Later, I have this and said that I will stand as a candidate for the office of the President, if I am elected senator.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
My goal is not the function of the function is an instrument with which I realized My vision.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I need as much influence and a strong mandate.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television, but anyone who wants to make a difference.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
There are the media who want to rob the, and the freedom of speech with the freedom to confuse.

The battle for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations about 20 million crowns.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
You have to change laws.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
How do you solve this problem?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
As a simple citizen, I have to the fact that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The problem is the petty politics - if someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal, that it is rejected, and that keeps the population.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
As an independent party, I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
My advantage is that I without drawers thinking and party dogma of each party can take what is best for our country.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Do you see yourself as a man in politics, rather than on the right or left?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
This thinking, but it is completely irrelevant.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
For me, it is important that we move forward.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or the right, I would like to connect people.

<seg id="32">
I am always publicly any good solution, even if this comes from the or ODS, and I will against bad ideas.

It bothers you, if someone described you as populists.

If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have an ideal destination and a vision.

But without support in Parliament, you are only key words.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
And so that you are not in politics in the long term.

Or do you think that you, if you talk long enough with the people will be able to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability?

As president, it would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.

And then, the would have to say why they oppose it.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
A strong personality, which refers to grievances, can put pressure on the political scene.

Take the direct election of the president, who was a credit to the public pressure.

I know that I am not alone; that is why I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether they do not want to run for the Senate.

In the Senate, we are only two independents.

Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and county.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
Do you think about setting up your own party?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
I have not thought about it, because I don't have the time to review the past any potential party member, and do not have the money for it.

You are driving an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?

That is not very convincing.

<seg id="72">
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.

Should I do about debt?
</seg>
<seg id="74">
I have already spent 2.5 million into the campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is probably not too much interest.

<seg id="76">
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
The cost of the campaign are in fact covered by my salary as a senator.

<seg id="78">
But the senators salary, I could not live alone; for example, my son, I could not finance the English school, which costs 30,000 per month.

Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, with Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But Berlin abstained.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Why?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Germany now has to be careful, however, because of its special relationship with Israel.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, be too critical of Israel.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it came to set up a no-fly zone.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This was, after all, enforced by NATO.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Yes, that is true.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
That is because it is from his foreign policy, away from a policy that were managed by the United States, a German foreign policy.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
To make matters worse, the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Germans are in the.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I think of their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
What does a "normal" foreign policy from a German point of view?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
It shows a willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Germany's economic interests are different from those of the other major powers, to a certain extent, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
These economic interests have an impact on the in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
That is why it must be careful not to alienate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In any case, which plays a role.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
But in any case, it plays an important role in German thinking.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by the important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
I believe in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic collapse, as in the Libyan issue.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Maybe Germany will even some respect.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Because it signals that it must be taken into account as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The United States have called for a veto.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
As a result of American domestic politics these differences have always existed.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
I believe that the government under Obama has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
But due to the political situation here, the government can not represent this position publicly, of course.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all, are we talking about Netanyahu's policies.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
It is difficult to Germany, its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
So they cannot be part of a wider line and have instead things from their own position.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
They are with the euro.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
This has always been a sensitive issue.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a leading role?
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Germany is still the lead or?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
Germany is still not used to it, that is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time Germany takes on a greater role in various anti-German feelings.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
That does not make it easy for the Germans.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
This is the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
In Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics, not the EU fills the vacuum at the moment but who is?
</seg>
<seg id="62">
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
</seg>

Even if they do not like them, it is unpleasant, and it is Even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.

<seg id="43">
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.

<seg id="44">
This is a record and meant that China, for the 10th time in the list of applications around the world, with the authority.

Now, the matter is pending before the Supreme Court of Justice.

<seg id="57">
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and commends the professionalism of the courts.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and is costing us a lot of time, money and nerves."
</seg>
<seg id="59">
The internal costs could not quantify the company, even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.

Five years ago, Freudenberg, in a "high six-figure euro amount" on the other side of the settlement.

As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather.

<seg id="65">
This business, but the company has a long time, he was able to avert the registration.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

"You have to watch it," says Wentzler.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Both he and the lawyer advising German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, the foreigners "everything is somehow, in China," as Wentzler says.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registration.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
In fact, if Freudenberg In the last act of his trademark drama, then you would have to pay the other side of fees for their own name, explains Wentzler.

Rakfisk from Norway: is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe, but around the world.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Could the secret to the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It is in the middle of a pile of dirty, humid sports clothing.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
And leave it there for a week.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
So you have to think about the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which just won't go away.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you would have stinky fish would like - up to a year in water is fermented.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
If the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
"You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk general" also organized the festival.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take large quantities of alcohol.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Harvard.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The Spirituose can crowd out the smell.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I eat a.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
If it avoids the Rakfisk in, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling and fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In the deepest winter, he was taken out after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
A generation ago thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and in the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who not long ago was far richer than Norway, are immigrants.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He is one of the more expensive meals, which you can buy here.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But here, it is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs 10 euros.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Here you hate it still, to name Anders Breivik - those racist right-wing extremist, who last year 77 men, women and children shot.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Instead, it refers only to the "incident on 22 July."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in the country.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien since the early 1970s, the growth of the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
"But oil is not the only reason why we are so good," says Anna, our waitress, with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes, the round trays with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
We are, as they say, prudent people.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Her English is just like that of most people here.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry for the benefit of future generations is invested in a special fund.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis all threw money around, that they do not have anything, Norway closed its wallet.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
"And, of course, Rakfisk eat," she adds with easy laughter.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
I am standing in the snow and ask for another court, I have had enough of Rakfisk.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Such a moose burger is something else. The juicy meat mundet me.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
But in the evening, on the menu.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several locations that, which can organise a Rakfisk Dinner, where guests for the best - or perhaps the sense of smell the most challenging - fish.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
There is a live TV circuit with a fly to show master, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor Jürgen?"
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
"Are our points,."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
Applause and laughs.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish.

<seg id="8">
I grew up in central California and has been all my life, "Mexicans."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
An ethnic symbol - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Later, I opted for "Mexican". "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
But this was Mexico.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
I was just Americans.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to talk in this language on both ends of an interview.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not go well.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
I thought about that moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
On the agenda of all those issues that, if the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Pena Nieto was also very interested to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans remain today, with a high probability in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc after the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even though he gave no details.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Most Americans probably never waste a single idea that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun forced to leave them more than half of its territory.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
But for Mexicans, who in centuries, not in minutes, are not the memories of this event.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
, as soon as a U.S. government official only mildest criticism in Mexico - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans, the sovereignty of their neighbour.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
And the children of on the war path.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
And yet the biggest challenge in Mexico is in fact, in the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Want to talk about resentment?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
There are more than enough.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for whom it does not do this.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - no chance in Mexico, and in the north.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Not Mexico.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
And although we may have to live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Our identity is blurred, perhaps, but when it comes to our loyalty, this is not the case.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
This is certainly in the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
This is based on reciprocity.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never strong enough.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
They say that our existence is a symbol of failure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
If not our families in Mexico have failed, they would not have gone.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
And then we would not be caught behind the silk curtain now - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally as a child in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
While it is a US citizen, sees herself as part of the two countries.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
But many Mexican Americans, who I know, on the not on the other country.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in any one of them.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education and to to the diaspora.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
Now.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
This will not happen.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Too many hurt feelings.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
And given the unequal income distribution, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
I am afraid you alone, Amigos.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">
That is fair.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they must also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members were not so long ago.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
Hmmm.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.

The Old battles, new Middle East

<p>
<seg id="2">
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
There will be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such a hope in The bud.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In the midst of the usual recriminations countless buildings were in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally end.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
A war that is neither lost nor won
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation is anything but.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November, have strengthened the this week's fighting the on both sides.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, to say that the Israelis have pushed back, although his group even suffered heavy losses.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and corners of the planet, Israel has so far, not to destroy Hamas.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Indeed, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
And Hamas leaders might come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Turkey, a, regional power, which was once known as Israel's closest Muslim ally, Hamas has taken party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren embossing before Stürzung Bashar Assad could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
And, in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot, who ruled Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders more dependent on people's views.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be as a player that can't, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The Israeli hardliners, however, an opposite conclusion.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
In military terms, Hamas is not a threat.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In diplomatic terms, the United States hold their position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
Israel has in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has been largely ignored the peace process.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the, which in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements that have been of international law, but always be developed further.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with a group.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Why is this cunning Palestinians and left to their own state?
</seg>
<seg id="33">
If they had control of the West Bank, in fact, they would not like their colleagues in Gaza, fire rockets?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish you, they should dare to raise their heads.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to, But the Arab spring could make them.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will focus on the problems in their own country.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair its economy.

This pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
The Israelis should think long-term.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg, which will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand increasingly over the years, its diplomatic toll.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Both sides need a nudge from outside
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
The right answer is that the one of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states, where Israel is for security purposes.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The for the near future small - hope is that the cease-fire gives outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Egypt must stop now, together with Turkey and Qatar arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas to the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by the of and a common Jerusalem.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Outsiders Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for un observer status.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

Obama also needs to do its part to push Israel to negotiate.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.

Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also to participation.

But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.

Australian laws for single cigarette packaging in force

Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands

The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging in Australia, came into force, logos and colors will be replaced by neutral, olive green cap, are also printed with graphic images, which show sick body parts and cigarette smoke sick infants and children.

Australia is the world's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging.

The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.

It is the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke will start with 26, with 99% probability.

"You can already see in children young age that they understand the message of tobacco companies trying to compete with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. It cited studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo associated with the idea of a princess.

Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar steps.

"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.

Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.

A number of Australian law has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, to act as sponsors, and most traders were forced to sell cigarettes in shops no longer. Now the tobacco advertising is on the Internet.

The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and, but has no influence on The international sides.

On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman noted an increase in reports to brands that have been written by "ordinary people."

We must ask the question: is this just a private person who is so much Marlboro cigarettes that they even include a video - or a marketing agency has to do with it?

In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
This Thanksgiving, I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane unexpectedly due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another plane.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts on boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
I do not want to lie.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight to, is pretty annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
If it goes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes bored.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
So that the brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, which promotes creativity.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And because most of us, almost constantly on a screen or, we do not get the benefits of boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Yes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And no.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
I will come back again.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure time.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"In fact, the boredom is a very long history," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom in many ways been defined and discussed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, "a satisfactory job to do, but not to be able to define."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Boredom is different from apathy, in such a way that the person is not, but it would be.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of the process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Boredom can listen almost like depression.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But Professor Eastwood believes that although, even though these two conditions, could be bored people see the problem in their area or the world, while depressed people see the problem in itself.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Sometimes, we believe that it is boring, even if we only have to concentrate.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
In their study, "the Unengaged mind: Defining boredom in terms of attention" - for example: "the idle mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a band, in which a person read a magazine article.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Some groups have heard a loud tv program from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard these sounds at all.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
The people who heard the barely audible television, said to have more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
If you put a monotonous work, "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, can distract music and help to not feel bored."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people who are physically attentive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
All of us will be boring - my late flight, a dröhnender speakers, a particularly tedious film.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But some people get bored more easily than others.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
In order to measure these differences, researchers have developed a "scale in the 1980s, to boredom vulnerability."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
On the scale there are statements such as "many things that I have to do to repeat and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
With the help of such scales researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly on, with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.

<seg id="40">
In the year 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment In which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and the were bored, while 23% said to be bored, if they were not in school.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
But only 3% of parents said to feel bored.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
But he was sure that "youth is seen as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
So back to my original question: boredom is healthy?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Sometimes, as in extreme cases, it does not mean that people take extreme physical risks and gambling or drugs to, in order to relieve - studies have shown.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This view is professor Vodanovich, who researched the subject for more than two decades.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
"With the boredom, the brain wants to say that we should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
But the brain does not always know what you should do it best.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
If it is boring and you use the energy to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But television can in the short term for happiness, these evaporate But in the long term.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
Anyone who is his bored child an iPad, it can distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas more self-control.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
We should also do not see it.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Instead, our aim should be to feel at home, away from the constant activity and technology.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Professor Eastwood agrees.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
"It sounds as if we would have to be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
He believes that people in truth only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
"In an environment in which we are constantly, it is hard to look, when the noise is silent."

In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court, which in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few chunk of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
According to Orozco, he and some friends on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia -, each with a penalty of US $100 - and received a court date.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But it is also a?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends less on hundreds of minor drug on the law, on the site.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Hundreds of, which revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures have already dropped.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The police authorities are adults over 21 years longer for possession of small. This is allowed by law, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
But prosecutors in more conservative districts Colorados have announced to follow existing marijuana offenses, and people are still in court.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains on new, to prevent a state licensed marijuana shops in the opening in their communities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, which is located east of Denver.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
And regulators in the state of Washington, scratch on the.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
They are waiting for a guide to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that in any case, most states of Colorado, with regard to the regulation of marijuana. There was only legalized the drug for medical purposes and then for private consumption.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Orientation of the state is," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and the end of a grey area in which the government licensing system does not yet exist, but it is legalized the possession.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
And unpleasant practice questions need to be addressed at this time - for example, as the government of a "reasonable access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities to be agreed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
"Nowhere is it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis, "a recently formed research group.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
On 21 November sent Chief Oates an email to his employees in Aurora, in which he said that the prosecutor would not pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years longer, and that the police "" will not for these offences.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The police Chief Oates added that will continue to enforce the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and urban targets would continue to pursue drug traffickers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
In Weld County In northern Colorado represents County prosecutor Ken Buck a stricter view.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Currently, 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, even though many have been charged for other offenses.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations, in which it to the point of the offence," Buck said in a statement.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
The reactions are even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, shows adults for the possession of small amounts of not longer.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but not all outstanding possession proceedings.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
"I do not think that I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound dilemma among local officials, the big green experiment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
In a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, the defendants standing trial for marijuana crimes, and as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
"They have spent a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for it, that they can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an age of legal, they are also nervous wait on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Despite several high-profile arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that no doors will likely to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but probably will resist the legal under the new legislation to by the state regulated marijuana shops.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Several cities in Colorado, not just wait for the fact that the federal authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although this could open in about a year.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Last week decided Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
"We do not want to get into a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Our community has voted against this legislation.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
We have done this for the community, not, for what the state decided.

There are still many questions unanswered.

Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am Tory
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Not only university students today are being attacked for her views
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="3">
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought was the largest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance -.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College at the end of the - I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
My father broke down in tears.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
My friends were confused.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I would have had a problem with fellow students in the adjacent room had sex.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The author of A N Wilson said, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
But the truth was less amusing.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
I ran away.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Not because of my unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I had harassed me for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment: my late father now Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and supporter of the Conservative Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Why do I mention this now?
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Now, according to latest reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week, the same equal protection of gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College, they are often actively isolated because of their political views "personally attacked and declared undesirable."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
They are calling for a place in the equality of their college, in order to ensure that their views can be freely expressed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Joe Cooke, a former president of the conservative student association has been shown, among other things, It was of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls Royce and with silver suit and.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
At other universities say conservative students, they are as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative Students of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing tendency to universities.

People think we are like the Bullingdon club, without us to at all. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the conservative student association of Oxford says she watched with, members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the of the members," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
In my first weeks in Oxford, I was part of a minority.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I had arrived in September 1986.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In the Last year, the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student - as a result of cuts in higher education to give title.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The atmosphere would have been even Stalinists.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In the first days of the week, get to know the new students and tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
I made the experience that the tutors mockery of Tory students not only tolerated, but even with joy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English. What should have been, I was not taken.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."

<seg id="37">
I stumbled.

<seg id="38">
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are you just stupid?" He asked me.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The other students.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
In my eyes wallten tears.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"I suggest that you take a few French hours in your free time, if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
On this evening, I sat alone in the college at the dinner when someone typed me slightly on the shoulder.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I know who you are," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Anyone who is suspected of being a Tory,.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse For you.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Most Tory, to be supporters of the Labour Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
In a local pub I later tried to distract me.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I insisted that I was not entirely agree with Mrs Thatcher.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
A number of new entrants in philosophy, politics and economy, which had visited as a conservative force, ironically, the Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
</seg>
<seg id="55">
You are dirty.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Other students shared his opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
I was perverse and dirty.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
"As the Tories have sex?" Asked me one.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
The beat each other, right?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">
I felt so as homosexuals had to have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
I Would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
</seg>
<seg id="62">
I would like to meet like-minded people only after nightfall?
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
</seg>
<seg id="64">
The three years before me, I extended to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
The only tutor, who as a Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
He was rarely there.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
"You will not be happy here," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">
I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
My father told me that I hated, and why I did it.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
He seemed incredulous.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
This is something like that they would never do in my city of dreaming spires.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
Even my communist friends, always impeccable manners.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
Tarnished his moist eyes.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
A chance.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
I am sure you neckt.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
It would break my heart if you were walking.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and his convictions.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
During a Tutoriums in the following week, in which claimed another history tutor seriously, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
Although I secretly in shame, I admitted that my parents to a "brainwashing" and called them "old sucker."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">
The relief lasted only briefly.
</seg>
<seg id="87">
It was my father, who was the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
</seg>
<seg id="88">
At that time, he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">
My door was locked.
</seg>
<seg id="90">
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave my persecutors.
</seg>
<seg id="91">
As they went, I was a bag and took the first train to London.
</seg>
<seg id="92">
I never returned.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">
You can call me a weinerlichen wimp.
</seg>
<seg id="94">
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
</seg>
<seg id="95">
And it is tragic that it was an university of Oxford, who did not only 14 Tory prime Minister, but until now hidden behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.

This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist of "il signore" Garavani, is not without its clients could have been written.

Valentino has always felt fascination with the and distant world of the aristocracy.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In the first room of the exhibition, which will be 3 March, there is a lot of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from humble fashion in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.

"At least they are not their sites on your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from the pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.

Key questions
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information, with the release of these pages have changed the rules of the game," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in education at the University of Yale and the author of the "digital natives and Immigrants" these words to explain the phenomenon.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
They are The digital natives, The children and young people who grew up with this technology.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them where we learn," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
He said that it is a complex issue, "because we ask them, that they have a defined criteria about what should be published or, said in an age where the maturity is not enough."
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"They should also be picky when it is the most important to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions that they thought.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
"To tell you, they are not To do not work," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
Porras calls after some possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Or: would you like it published a photo of you, as you posted from a friend?
</seg>
<seg id="51">
Do you know what the others about you?
</seg>
<seg id="52">
The other people you've asked for permission, if you have pictures of celebrations labelled?
</seg>
<seg id="53">
And another question: do you need to know what you are doing at any moment?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
Another point is to make them to understand that they must act as they do offline.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
They are the same rules.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
"Someone outside of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
Monitoring
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read carefully the of the social networks.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
If they understand all of them, they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one user account on the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"For example, the age, or what you should share or publish," he says.

The cause of death due to AIDS is now too late detection
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV positive.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He hid it from his family.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He decided to go to his illness and began to inform, and this with such dedication that He has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 1990s was difficult to see how many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
At that time, it avoided even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
But many people in the clinic, who know nothing about their illness and the virus has already caused damage and has exhausted her immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information had been supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 inferred that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life the degree of impairment of the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that would have greater opportunities that are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Simply put, the above mean that, at the age of 25 years who gets diagnosed HIV positive, in that sense, "can easily be 75 years old, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
In order to this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans an average of 76 years.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS, from cases in 2007 to in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), it is true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of of the patients have died in the national database.
</seg>

In the year 2011 255 people died in Jalisco, and the month of May this year there are 187 deaths since 2005, but assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
- Why so people are still dying?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
- In my opinion, is not the problem of access to treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of drugs. The problem is that the people in an advanced state, because they do not know their infection, in very late stages of the disease.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
He makes a powerful statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, and that is why all the people, where it is massive screening tests must be offered."
</seg>

This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (national committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio, who was already carry out its test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age in the AIDS stage, and even the Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Some think that they will die, and do not want to hear.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"If I have to die, then it is three times burst," said, in my case.

The change was to improve, I ernähre well, and take the medication.

After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the group of Vitro, which has been achieved by a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a sinister precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country, which has payment problems.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements have no validity.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
In practice on 15 June recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale on the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas, the Mexican companies are subject to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo.

While the judge of the matter that lenders must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, says the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, first, that the is the main proceedings for the trade in Mexico.

<seg id="6">
The first point would mean that international cooperation in the event of companies with trans-national profile is not known.

<seg id="7">
In fact, was created to this end, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, with the American law Institute was used as a mediator.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Secondly, the ruling determined that without the votes of the companies for recognition of the in the bankrupt estate the branches of Vitro, with its parent company, the majority needed for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have achieved.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies) were confirmed by.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the voices of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had, would not have a majority.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
This is not taken into account by the court of appeal.

On the other hand, there is Vitro debt for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the economic crisis in the United States, which has been in the country.

It is not the, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The most serious in this case is that the court had a document, which was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura an amicus curiae (friend of the court), where the procedure by Vitro is described in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, and that is pointed out that it had to the agreement signed by both countries to respond to Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life."
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The organization of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, who was connected to the for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Few in Puerto Rico have a great intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, was Rexes part of this sport for 6 years, as a player and manager in the lower classes, players of the first national League, agent BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of basketball Association.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"My whole life I have many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, managing director of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Basketball was my life."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Reyes not exaggerating with this statement.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and almost all of them.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Bayamón in the heart
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the centre of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as a manager or of the club.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
"These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a managing director, has been further or coach.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There were many rewarding years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy BSN.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
From then took over, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "said Reyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
I know that I am Gene Bartow, who was here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Do you want it? "
</seg>
<seg id="17">
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Bartow recommended that the free throw Proffesionals Raymond Gausse, and was one of our best shooter.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I remember how he said that if Mincy had made a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but even from a distance, because he was already 1988 at the top of the association.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
At that time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Then came the World Cup in 1990, in which we the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if not the Canadian referee had been the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
This group was the 1990 World Cup, the best national team you have ever seen?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
It is one of the best, as well as those who the that won 2004 Olympics against the Dream team.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
My favorite is the team the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and the team of the United States offered a fight, as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be 1990 because of a knee injury.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities, not the best, but we won a gold medal and was a great pleasure to those of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won against all the gold medal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
There was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
And this without taking account of his career in the various leagues, in which he has played.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
This is a difficult question.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
We have had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
What do you think is the best, What you have achieved in the association?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in one season.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
What remains to be done to you?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
That the guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and only in the national playoffs teams from other corners of the island.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Today, the children of many unnecessary trips and games.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
At least I can see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches, officials and referees.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
I am proud of that.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
What do you do?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
I like to listen to music, watch videos, music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
