<h1>
<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to the re-election of Obama to confront</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, keeping the Brennan Center, the latter for a myth, by selecting it reiterates that the electoral fraud in the United States less than the number of people killed by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The attorneys for the Republicans have in 10 years in the USA, by the way, just 300 cases of electoral fraud were recorded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is for sure: these new provisions will be a negative impact on voter turnout impact.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, undermine these measures are part of the democratic System of the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In contrast to Canada, the United States for the implementation of the elections in each of the States responsible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, the new laws promulgated, the procedure for the registration or the election more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon has after the elections in November 2010 gained in importance, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, 180 bills in 2011 alone, introduced, in which the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States limit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require that the voter photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship is required.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to this, these laws also the time periods for the early voting shortened, the right to be declared invalid on the day of elections, as voters to register, and citizens the right to vote is denied, for a Gerichtsakte exists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections, has no US state of voters is required, a photo ID must be presented.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first state that such a demand has been raised.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Supreme court of the United States was confirmed in the year 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities have hurried, this practice to other States as well.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the course of the last two years fostered in 34 States to initiate laws, with which the voter can be forced to a photo ID must be presented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identification card, such as the health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters persons are not of a government Agency, your state issued photo ID.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million Neuwähler in the year 2012 not have such a card.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, it is often more than one hundred dollars to pay to get the necessary identification to obtain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, possess 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the persons with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years of age and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years of age does not have the required photo ID.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This extends even further.</seg>
<seg id="25">The students, as voters considered to be their voice more democratic candidates review, it is in several States, is not allowed, your by your institution issued photo ID to use.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, allow the same States members of Angel or Jagdvereinen, the stronger for the Republican side, choose, which of these Associations is issued cards for elections to use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Before 2004, has no state for Choosing a proof of citizenship is required.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first state that such a demand to bring it in.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011 have a dozen States adopted laws of the voters demand that your US citizenship to prove.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures aim is clearly to the Hispanic vote to limit.</seg>
<seg id="31">Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters, the democratic party prefer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In addition, Republican lawmakers 2011 in eight States laws promoted, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups is limited, those voters to help the wish to register for.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequences.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the General elections of 2004, contributed approx. 10 million. Citizens to register.</seg>
<seg id="36">Because by since 2009 adopted measures the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006, to 17%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Also, the Republican lawmakers in five other States adopted laws aimed at the period for early voting to shorten.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, were in the General elections 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters in advance have chosen, Afro-Americans, although only 13% of the voters of the state that make a difference.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same applies for the Hispanic population.</seg>
<seg id="40">The latter accounted for only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens in advance.</seg>
<seg id="41">In contrast, made White, 76% of the voters were only 46% of the electorate in advance chose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters vigorously the adoption of laws is confronted with, the registration of voters limit.</seg>
<seg id="43">A number of bills were by the vetoes of the democratic governors blocked.</seg>
<seg id="44">The advocate-General of the United States has intervened to make the most controversial laws to suspend.</seg>
<seg id="45">You could damage partly limit.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 of the 34 States adopted laws, the Presentation of a photo ID request.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the new rules introduced in the year 2012, undoubtedly, the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The democratic critics denounce the political nature of the adopted laws, and see them as a clear objective of which is to influence the results in the 2012 key States.</seg>
<seg id="49">A report of the Brennan center of 2011 shows that those countries have passed laws, 171 of 270 votes constitute, in the Wahlmännergremium are required to the presidency to win.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to know with certainty to confirm that these legislative Changes to the electoral system have significant effects on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is for sure: these new provisions will negatively affect voter turnout.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, undermine these measures are part of the democratic System of the USA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the Test should be made or not?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The PSA Test manner in fact, sometimes erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results, to unnecessary medical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="3">This leads to a greater reluctance of the already indecisive men for the implementation of early diagnosis procedures.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Test should be made or not?</seg>
<seg id="5">We have the opinion of two specialists obtained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the United States of America studies conducted passed numerous confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another study, this Time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the probability of formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is why I recommend the Test from the age of 50 years, respectively. 40 years ago, if you are a direct Relative who is already suffering from prostate cancer.</seg>
<seg id="10">In men afro-American origin, is also at a higher risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The most Important thing is to make the right decision, once a cancer has been detected.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are types of cancer, the aggressive, and others, the indolent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The patient needs to the extent of the risk of his cancer really be made understandable by the possible options will be identified, in which Prostatakrebse are left untreated, if he is the quality of life in the long run is not affected, and in these cases for a more active Monitoring of the sick.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Today, there are many men, where cancer has recognized, no treatment, since her cancer is not aggressive, and there is no threat to their lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">It proposes an active Monitoring and provides you with progression of the disease and treatment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One determined with increasing precision, the criteria for deciding who should be treated, and who is not.</seg>
<seg id="17">Therefore, I recommend nevertheless, the execution of the Tests.</seg>
<seg id="18">Most important, it is but, with his doctor to speak, in order to determine whether he should be conducted or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In collaboration with the international society for urology Movember has developed a tool, with which it is possible, the pros and cons of PSA testing to evaluate.</seg>
<seg id="20">This document (currently only in English, but a Translation will be available soon) can be downloaded from the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Prevention of the disease</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Despite the progress made in the research remains the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way, in order to reduce the risk of him developing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">It is estimated that 30% of cancer could be prevented if all eat well and get enough would move.</seg>
<seg id="25">"If there are no smokers more, would this value to at least 50% increase in", stresses Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the canadian cancer society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">However, it is assumed that about 10% of the cancers caused by inheritance.</seg>
<seg id="27">Several remain totally unclear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For the canadian cancer society remains the fight against the tobacco dependence is a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It strongly harms the health of the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Today, there are in Quebec 1.5 million. Smokers", says the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.</seg>
<seg id="33">Encouraging data: 10 years after the waiver on the cigarette, and you reduce the risk of dying from cancer by half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The Weight</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">According to the canadian cancer society to promote Overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="36">You seem to be the risk for breast, column-, rectum, esophagus, pancreas and cervical cancer to increase.</seg>
<seg id="37">"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout the life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects", he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The Diet</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The organization also recommends that the red meat consumption to a minimum.</seg>
<seg id="40">In large quantities, it increases the risk of a Grimm - or. Rectal cancer disease.</seg>
<seg id="41">Sausage products should also be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">The preservation of meat due to Smoking, Drying or salts can cause the formation of carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The latter can damage the body's cells and the development of cancer," he explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Vitamins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In recent years, a number of scientists of the relationship between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer studied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Their investigations are currently not conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="47">According to the canadian cancer society are the studies on Vitamin E contradictory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">During a study of the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer has found out, showed a different rather an increase.</seg>
<seg id="49">The effect of Vitamin D on the cancer was also not clearly shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">In addition, it emphasises Mr. Beaulieu, how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family history to speak of.</seg>
<seg id="51">"The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The Higgs Boson is analyzed</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has in the last summer of a certain interest, and for good reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">We believe in the fact that this Boson at nothing less than the mechanism is involved, for the mass of all objects in the universe is responsible.</seg>
<seg id="4">And finally, it refers to the last particles whose existence from the standard model of our best, or at least false" explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but empirically not yet been observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it's really the Higgs.</seg>
<seg id="6">We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we are a real new particles, and that it is the standard model predicted Higgs Boson is very similar.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, this seems to be due to new data to be confirmed, which this week on a large physics Congress in Kyoto were presented, but it still lacks the data, in order to be completely sure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Go, we nevertheless believe, that it is indeed the Higgs is, there seems to be only a low risk, to deceive, and we will look at what it is about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">There are in this world, a necessarily inviolable law, which means that two objects are not at the same time at the same place may be present.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not possible to breach the above rule and try not to be too strong, because they hurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out, that for such a law: the Pauli's Ausschlussprinzip, which States that two particles is not the same room at the same time can occupy, if you are in the same quantum state", and this "state" on the Whole, from some of their properties.</seg>
<seg id="12">Assuming parts of the physicists of particles in two categories.</seg>
<seg id="13">In a corner there are the good citizen, as Fermions are designated and well-behaved the Pauli principle obey.</seg>
<seg id="14">And in the other to move the bosons, an ugly gang of anarchists, for whom nothing is sacred, and in any case not of this principle, which means that you are in fact at the same time in the same place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">These bosons are divided according to the site, The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (by the way, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the mesons, which we can't handle, and the "Kraftteilchen", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs Boson related somehow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It must however be stressed that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are, as you might think.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you are capable of this chronicle to read, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the Photon, or the "photon", the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.</seg>
<seg id="18">If a particle with an electrical charge accelerated or a change of direction, the electromagnetic field is exactly in this place "disturbed", like a Pebble in a pond.</seg>
<seg id="19">Through this "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon and thus one of the bosons, "the carrier of the power".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">More Stable Field</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The same applies for the Higgs Boson, with the difference that a different field, Higgs field, "disturbed" to this Boson.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, the Higgs field is very much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the causative agent must be very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond, its surface only by a very large rock ridged could be.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why a huge particle accelerators, such as the CERN necessary, the Large Hadron Collider is a Ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to such energies to achieve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to the relationship between the Higgs and the mass to explain.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are, in fact, not all the particles and not all of the materials with the electromagnetic field interacting with.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some, such as magnets, to do this, but others are not - for example, would a sheet of paper never even in the refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="27">And likewise, all the particles do not interact with the Higgs field: those who do it, have a mass, while the other (like the Photon) no mass.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">For what can all this research now to "be good", asks woman Plamondon?</seg>
<seg id="29">For the science, they serve to test the standard model (SM), and they allow the physicists also, all the deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM to examine exactly.</seg>
<seg id="30">By the way, there are numerous physicists, the eagerly-in the hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference a door to a "new physics" open and some of the holes of the model could cram.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is necessary to tell, that the latter is still serious shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the force of gravity (oops!) and the dark matter provides approx. 80% of the matter in the universe (re-ups!).</seg>
<seg id="32">However, there have been at CERN such deviations until now not been found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Impact</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The implications of this research for the General population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no God.</seg>
<seg id="35">By the way: in the early ' 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell labs, does not suspect, that their Work in such a Revolution would trigger.</seg>
<seg id="36">They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="37">Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle - the Bell Labs has worked, in which the Laser in the 1960s was invented, and the 1962 even the first continuous-wave lasers (they were the first pulsed) developed has already said that the Laser at the beginning rather than a "Laborspielerei" was considered.</seg>
<seg id="38">Imagine...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition, for applications from all of the instruments, which the research surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="40">For example, in turn, has Willard Boyle 1969 during his Work in optics, a small light sensor developed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it is not the original purpose was, this Sensor today, all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and gave him the 2009 Nobel prize for physics to be introduced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you can never know...</seg>

<seg id="1">Palliative care is the best way to die... | Le Devoir</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">With your Committee to "Die with Dignity" has Quebec recently, the thorny question of the Lebensendes discussed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The debate must shortly be resumed, although a draft law is being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, it remains in this important topic is still much to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">Le Devoir has tried this in more detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A few weeks ago, lived Mr. L. alone in his apartment in the monteregian.</seg>
<seg id="7">The prostate cancer, it aufzehrte, had given him a period of two years left.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They gave me five years to live, I've got seven years managed," he said half-heartedly, in his bed at home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil lying, in which he on the previous day had arrived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"However, it is always a shock, so you can't be prepared," he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disease makes your work: a huge weakness prevents him from alone to go to the toilet, and even to eat.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the table in front of a delicious lunch sitting, he agrees resigned, when you eat to help them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brave he even succeeds to smile and Strangers to talk around him busy, give him his medication, and him a bath.</seg>
<seg id="13">The courage of the ordinary death.</seg>
<seg id="14">"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea heals, because this is humiliating"he shares.</seg>
<seg id="15">A few hours later, the Team has a remedy for this Evil found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In the course of our life, we learn that a man Standing peeing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the Kindheitsphase return is for some people an unacceptable humiliation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This depends on the ability of the Person", a throwback to accept, he notes.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because in the opinion of several persons, in the palliative care work, find great events in the midst of this regression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois to be instructed, all suffer from cancer.</seg>
<seg id="21">You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.</seg>
<seg id="22">In this stage you will be by the Doctors and nurses who take care of them, not with so-called "healing" maintenance of the force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">For Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the worst fear, "consciously and by asphyxiation" to die.</seg>
<seg id="24">But by the disease, I have my children really gotten to know.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I have good children," she adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I have no more desires in life," she said, before she accepted that she puts on a mask that your Breathing helps.</seg>
<seg id="27">You are expected in the next few days, still a last visit her son, who comes from Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the home Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and help with the food intake.</seg>
<seg id="29">The palliative care is used when there are no other possibilities exist any more.</seg>
<seg id="30">To Die more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Quebec comes on of 11,700 inhabitants a bed for the palliative care services.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is very little, if one takes into account that one day we all will die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Here is the life in the best possible conditions to continue, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the Physicians of the home.</seg>
<seg id="34">Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">You are granted the Dying, depending on the desire to have a care with Brandy or Pepsi.</seg>
<seg id="36">Diabetics need to have their blood sugar control.</seg>
<seg id="37">And death is a part of everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Yesterday evening, we have Mr. X, a beer is served, in the course of the night died.</seg>
<seg id="39">Today, Tomorrow will be the son of the beer at the feet of the deceased drink.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We help families and patients alike," reports Pflegedirektorin Nathalie Savard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">In the home Victor-Gadbois no day is like the other.</seg>
<seg id="42">Next to an old man of 93 years, the last family reunion in Hof enjoys a well by his pillow, backed, while his honor hit dies, a young man of 36 years, from his parents, his wife and two small children, surrounded tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"For the past six months of three to five beds are always with cancer patients aged less than 45 years"tells Dr. Christiane Martel concern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalized patients come from your place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Problem of access to palliative care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that the Suffering of patients alleviate, if the latter is the final stage of your life, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.</seg>
<seg id="47">And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois, and the society for domestic palliative care services in the greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively to the care of cancer patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Exactly this great inadequacy of the health care Quebec ensures that more of the palliative care specialist Doctors of the adoption of a law on the regulation of euthanasia and assisted suicide, with concerns together.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since the month of October is a Manifesto in circulation, the prominent personalities of the palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed to their opposition to such an Initiative to be tested.</seg>
<seg id="50">Dr. Christiane Martel, according to the healthcare system in Quebec is not powerful enough to make sure that all the right to a high-quality palliative care services have, before you are accepted, to euthanasia move.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Recently, she says, I have a patient seen, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room and no one measures to alleviate has taken.</seg>
<seg id="52">I am afraid that the patient is the only reason to want to die, because they have no adequate health care.</seg>
<seg id="53">And at the same time treat multiple oncologists their patients, despite the worst forecasts desperately until the last day.</seg>
<seg id="54">The chances of Survival of Helena Richard were already minimal, as they are an arduous chemotherapy has canceled.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I my Oncologist told that I stop treatment will, they answered me, that you regret that I have to give up the fight, she said.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, she had told me that I was at the end!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">No omnipotent care</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff would like to thank, that this request is not complied with, after their pain by a Team of palliative care services have been alleviated.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In this season you have with PSG a new extent.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you explain this progress?</seg>
<seg id="4">It can be through a personal insight, but also by the new Dimension of the PSG explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Great players have come.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every day I'm on your side to progress.</seg>
<seg id="7">The technical staff has also given much.</seg>
<seg id="8">These items will inspire me every day to my level of play to improve.</seg>
<seg id="9">And in a game, this is even easier.</seg>
<seg id="10">In football, everything goes very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I break not in enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since my early days in the centre of preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I always have gradually made progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">You do so by Carlo Ancelotti, introduced competition advantage...</seg>
<seg id="14">The new signings this summer are accustomed to games at very high level assistance.</seg>
<seg id="15">You also know that each training session is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to the fact that a player like me, the forehead has to offer and want to do the Best.</seg>
<seg id="17">By the way, I Carlo Ancelotti much in terms of my position.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is Co-trainers such as Claude Makelele supported in the same Position played as I do.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Is Ancelotti is the right Person for the job?</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ancelotti instills all technicians respect.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Ligue 1, there are currently no comparable Person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23">He looks back on a rich experience and has many titles with prestigious Clubs won.</seg>
<seg id="24">He had contact with great players.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think that he is in Paris for more win a title.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">At that time, I had just returned from a Verletzungsserie recovered.</seg>
<seg id="28">The confidence he placed in me, is also an explanation for my services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?</seg>
<seg id="30">In Ligue 1, Lyon us the place of the Spitzenreiters taken.</seg>
<seg id="31">We lurking but in the ambush.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have in this way qualified for the knockout stages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What is the aim of the Association in this competition?</seg>
<seg id="34">We will try, as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">From now on, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, we will be against a very good European teams, our say.</seg>
<seg id="37">First of all, we want to first of our group in front of Porto, so we have the second leg of the Achtelfinales home game sweep.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The PSG in the short term, a major European club?</seg>
<seg id="39">He already has the Budget for it...</seg>
<seg id="40">To a big European club, Paris title win in the long term to make a name.</seg>
<seg id="41">Today this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="42">Financially, the PSG is the means for this project concrete shape.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">It would be a big failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 win, like in the last season was the case?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Of course, this would be a great disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="45">This year we are really at the heart of this title prices.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the last season, we were close.</seg>
<seg id="47">In may, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win outright.</seg>
<seg id="48">We have the season with a very strong performance of the terminated.</seg>
<seg id="49">We have with 79 points completed.</seg>
<seg id="50">Normally you should get with 79 points to be masters...</seg>
<seg id="51">But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.</seg>
<seg id="52">I believe that this year is the right one.</seg>
<seg id="53">Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title of the rings, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">Do you think that the media too much from the PSG expect?</seg>
<seg id="55">In light of what has been invested and the players that we have, is it normal, that much is expected of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">We accept completely.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, when we are at a home game against Troyes 4-0 win, and you still find something you accuse us, this is certainly a bit frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="58">One wonders what the people expect.</seg>
<seg id="59">We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not the FC Barcelona!</seg>
<seg id="61">We try a game concept to establish.</seg>
<seg id="62">A team builds up over time.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the Champions League we have strength proved.</seg>
<seg id="64">Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons creates, for the next round of qualifying, and also the huge spending!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In terms of the invested sums believed you to break with 15 points ahead!</seg>
<seg id="66">That would mean that our opponents and the French championship disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="67">Lyon and Marseille, in the last season were not good, were of this new PSG "geboostet".</seg>
<seg id="68">This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.</seg>
<seg id="69">I hope that we in the month of may, the smiling winner will be, and tell us that we, despite all the difficulties, finally won.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">The PSG seems to be completely different from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be dependent.</seg>
<seg id="71">So much the better, that one of a "Zlatan-dependence" speaks.</seg>
<seg id="72">This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and has a lot of scoring goals.</seg>
<seg id="73">That is why he came, and he proves that he is the Star of the Ligue 1.</seg>
<seg id="74">Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.</seg>
<seg id="75">Within the team we respect both the players and the Person.</seg>
<seg id="76">He respects also the people, who surrounded him.</seg>
<seg id="77">What he has done is truly extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="78">This motivates the Other, your level of play to improve.</seg>
<seg id="79">Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defender, it allows all Others to make progress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">As you will have the Euro 2012 with the French national team experienced?</seg>
<seg id="81">As a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="82">It was close to my heart, at this EM participate.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately for me, my injury prevented from some playing time out.</seg>
<seg id="84">I have seen things, from which I emerged strengthened am.</seg>
<seg id="85">Today, I succeed, good matches in the national team to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="86">This was since my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.</seg>
<seg id="87">From what Ukraine has happened, we have our lessons, and today we have an exemplary behavior of the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">What is your opinion on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">He has promising results achieved.</seg>
<seg id="90">We have a good Position in the selection for the world Cup.</seg>
<seg id="91">The national coach is strict, is available to the players close and encourages us to victory.</seg>
<seg id="92">As Laurent Blanc was.</seg>
<seg id="93">But I would like to no comparison.</seg>
<seg id="94">Blanc had reached his goal, by joining us for the EM qualified.</seg>
<seg id="95">I hope that Didier Deschamps the "Bleus" after Brazil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96">Is on the 16. October in Spain forced a draw (1:1) an opening match?</seg>
<seg id="97">This game has given us Confidence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Everyone has for all the others.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of Central banks, identified transactions and handling charges between the parties Involved.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political Vision tangible: the Belief that the current Bankmonopolen crafted monetary system, to financial crises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In fact, that is by Satoshi Nakamoto (a Pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (dollars, Euro, etc convertible) as well as a Protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, that the direct exchange of files.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With 15,000 computers in the network have already been approximately 200,000 transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some thousands of web sites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, a peak of $ 30 (23 Euro) had reached, he fell five months later, on 2 dollars before he today to around ten Dollar has recovered (the courses are available on the website bitcoincharts.com listed).</seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing particularly Impressive in comparison to the world trade of real-world currencies or financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in an in October, a report published on virtual currencies of interest shown.</seg>
<seg id="10">It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in the competition with the Dollar or the Euro," and "similar to the conventional currencies".</seg>
<seg id="11">Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "Credits", which used to be in a video game to move forward, it is possible to Play win or buy (and sometimes also zurücktauschen).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The social network Facebook has also such a System is developed.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the trade each Time from a Central authority is checked and edited.</seg>
<seg id="14">With Bitcoin are all the nodes at the same time, the Depositary of the Rechnungsbuchs, examiners, money issuers, as well as the buyer and the seller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">How does this network?</seg>
<seg id="16">Any transaction between two users takes place in reality between two E-Mail addresses in the Form of an E-Mail instead.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the difference that the user for any payment of a change of address can choose what the anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="18">A number of this transaction-related data is electronically by a double encryption system signed.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this way, the network can the authenticity of the transaction check.</seg>
<seg id="20">Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the entire network widespread accounting book of the public accounts exist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The crucial step is to put these new transaction in this book are entered.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is done using a mathematical task on the computers is launched, with the winner, a kind of preliminary Zentralbankier is, has the privilege of being, this additional line to add.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is a Fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unique fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Computer "take" the new transaction and add a number to add, before the Whole "chops".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The goal is to be the one to find a number of special fingerprint (lots of zeros at the beginning).</seg>
<seg id="26">If this number was found, the other node easily check if it is correct.</seg>
<seg id="27">The transaction is thus permanently with the chain of all other transactions related, and any modification would the fingerprint change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If a user with the intention to Defraud two Times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for, would be only one of the two transactions from the network will be validated and the other remains without a link, since both have different fingerprints.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Computer, the task receives 50 Bitcoins.</seg>
<seg id="30">To prevent Inflation is this reward regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="31">The circulating Bitcoins are thus to 21 million limited, but up to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, what a certain amount of leeway...</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, the difficulty of the task with every improvement in the computing power increases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The life of the network has already UPS and Downs had.</seg>
<seg id="34">The web sites, services for Bitcoin deploy, were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Used, the vulnerability does not affect the actual Protocol," says Pierre Noizat, just Paymium has introduced the company for the payment with real money, and the network Bitcoin uses.</seg>
<seg id="36">The ECB also reported about the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, cash also these shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="38">Key actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, you will be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="40">Recently, Adi Shamir, and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the book contains analyzed and shown that almost 80% of the Bitcoins not in circulation.</seg>
<seg id="41">In November, a "Mega-Sale" started.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, for the company Coinabul works, the Bitcoins in Gold converted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Pierre Noizat, the also the author of a book about this currency is firmly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk.</seg>
<seg id="44">His System Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin for the validation of the transactions, the cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="45">In addition, managed by the holder's identity and thus can remain anonymous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The System can be at the dealers are easy to implement, and the Latter have no new terminal or computer programs to install.</seg>
<seg id="47">You just need to specify an address, a telephone, "photographed and recognized", Pierre Noizat, assures that he is thousands of users.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is a General Trend was in the hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally oriented systems to be reconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It will take some time until Bitcoin interspersed, but in 2013, could be a turning point," he predicts.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">A Constitution with a crowbar in Egypt</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi.</seg>
<seg id="3">While Egypt in relation to the constitutional Declaration that it will temporarily unlimited power of attorney granted, more than ever, remains divided, he has decided, all on one card.</seg>
<seg id="4">To the Surprise of all, he has on Wednesday announced that the constituent Assembly the next day, its final version will adopt.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just a week had the head of state this plenary two additional months for the completion of his Work is granted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Egypt relies now for almost two years on a temporary basis, several times amended Text, which the institutional stability weakens and to a legal mess.</seg>
<seg id="7">This new Initiative has only to an even greater division of the country and taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="8">For his opponent remains the President in his "autocratic Delirium", by he continues, "his word breaks," and "the right with feet".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On pages of its advocates assures you that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible to end and the process of Transition to accelerate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within 14 days should a Referendum be held.</seg>
<seg id="11">A very short period of time, the brothers forces, on your intention to renounce the Egyptians, the Text section by section to explain.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the President, it is also a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, to find, during the Protest throughout the country is raging.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to assertions in an Interview with the American newsreel Time seems Mohammed Mursi convinced that the Egyptians favorably votes.</seg>
<seg id="14">Especially since the people of Egypt with this to fall back on a hasty vote issued an Ultimatum: "Either it is for my own design, or I keep the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should be after the adoption of the Constitution, supposedly an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent Assembly have the Text yesterday in a strange atmosphere was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of the liberals is that the demand is not complied with.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly before the constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have turned away, because you are of the opinion that they are not able to have their views to the full.</seg>
<seg id="18">Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities and civil society alike have acted.</seg>
<seg id="19">To achieve the quorum were yesterday Morning in haste to 11 persons, Deputy members, added.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some are Moslembrüdern very close.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is not surprising that the article mostly unanimously adopted.</seg>
<seg id="22">The commentators found it by the way, entertaining, that the only difference of the day... in the time for prayer has come, because some members of the Committee were of the opinion that the pendulum clock of the constituent Assembly not exactly went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Text that yesterday in the evening is adopted, consists of 234 articles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Article 2 all the attention, remains, finally, is identical to the Constitution of 1971, and States that "the principles of the Sharia is the main source of Law".</seg>
<seg id="25">The Salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic Law, an important requirement is that had the hope that "the principles" by "the rules" to replace what a stricter application would have made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, a proof of their good will and for their respect towards the other members of the Egyptian society.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hypocrisy" reciprocate the liberals, this is only a Propagandaschlag view.</seg>
<seg id="28">Because according to them, is the Islamization of the Constitution over other items.</seg>
<seg id="29">They have particularly article 220 in the eye, of the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role to play, particularly in relation to the Verification of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is troubling, because "the persons invited to submit its observations, not elected, and no democratic legitimacy.</seg>
<seg id="31">You can herein, the first signs of a theocracy, see".</seg>
<seg id="32">The fears of the liberals are also of the fact that fueled the next rector of this University, far less moderately as the present should be.</seg>
<seg id="33">"There is currently no specific religious commitment to detect.</seg>
<seg id="34">With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.</seg>
<seg id="35">Most of the lawyers in this Text have worked, are not Ulema, but academics, the part of the French System have been trained", appeased Alexis Blouet, a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, he admits that "in relation to the article 220 an ambiguity can be present, because the terms used in the religious vocabulary borrowed from.</seg>
<seg id="37">One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic law, the editor d. Ed.].</seg>
<seg id="38">And in the future, the question might be raised as to the extent to which Zivilrichter are competent to decide."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">In addition to its religious aspect of the yesterday Text adopted strong because of its far-reaching powers criticized, he is the President of the Republic granted.</seg>
<seg id="40">The Moslembrüder argue that these are compared with the former Regime considerably reduced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Another point of contention: the powers of the army.</seg>
<seg id="42">In accordance with the desire of the military is the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to the Parliament, but a national defense Council.</seg>
<seg id="43">Likewise, there is no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights had demanded.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latter also share their concerns with regard to the Text with that you as a freiheitsbedrohend view.</seg>
<seg id="45">The offence of blasphemy will be maintained, and insults are now banned, which has serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.</seg>
<seg id="46">In addition, no article is more on the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="47">In your opinion, is the only positive point the prohibition of torture by article 36.</seg>
<seg id="48">This word was in the previous Constitution does not contain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">While the Egyptian President yesterday evening in the television voice had, are demonstrations for today afternoon planned.</seg>
<seg id="50">The supporters of the head of state will be Saturday aufmarschieren.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">On 1. December was a law in force, which provides that any migrant worker a Test, the knowledge of the Russian language, certified, must discard one of them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Previously, this provision only for migrants who are in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail want to work.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, should the Tests with the time, according to the Federal migration authorities in the future, for all migrant workers to duty.</seg>
<seg id="9">One must not only language tests, but also Tests in the Russian history and the basics of the legislation drop.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Language skills both for the receipt as well as the extension of the work permit has to be demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Exceptions apply only for the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also by this law excluding persons, their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Sense of the issues and the protection of the rights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The whole of the regulatory Agency will be under the Aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of people's friendship, Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.</seg>
<seg id="15">The migrants can the Tests in all the cities of store; already were in Russia already more than 160 corresponding centers opened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Initiative for the introduction of the testing was made by the deputies of the state Duma and the Federal migration authorities supported.</seg>
<seg id="17">Civil libertarians, however, presented before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: What does the Whole thing?</seg>
<seg id="18">What changes will bring the regulation, language skills, to demonstrate the need, both for the Russians as well as for the workers?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Especially, counter spokesman for the migration authorities, the question, the number of forced laborers to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">"A lot of talk now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers", says the head of the representation of the Federal migration authorities in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.</seg>

<seg id="22">Only an organized recruitment is 90% of the problems of foreign workers to solve.</seg>
<seg id="23">Encounter problems migrants without occupation, education, language skills and medical examination.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills necessarily people with bad intentions to meet him under the pretext of the help in a dark, narrow barrack stuck, where he worked with dozens of his peers months without food and documents to wait 12 to 14 hours on the day of toil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Us achieve many of the complaints of our migrants.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In the home will make you A promise, and on arrival you will be scammed, get their passports taken and does not receive the promised reward", confirmed by the head of the main Directorate for labour migration of Tajik migration authorities, Tolib Schwaripow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do not scold, boss!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, in Russia you want to make money, too, that not only the language of the destination country does not dominate, but also in their own language hardly in writing expressions.</seg>
<seg id="29">Of course, this is not so much their fault as much as the Evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only a reasonable primary education afford.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because in their families, there is still not even have the money, to feed the children, let alone, you decent clothes, shoes and school Supplies to buy.</seg>
<seg id="31">As a Teenager to take these children then immediately the first opportunity to make money.</seg>
<seg id="32">"It is difficult without language skills", give it to.</seg>
<seg id="33">"You feel degraded and inferior."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Civil rights activists emphasize respect of the law following important aspect.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Test must only migrants with a legal Status drop.</seg>
<seg id="36">They have this Status does not, so there is no check and, consequently, no official work.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, holds the majority of the migrant workers continues to be illegal in Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Welcome" or "access to Unauthorized persons is prohibited"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Many migrants confirm that it is not easy in Russia an official Status.</seg>
<seg id="40">The reason there are bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the language difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="41">In addition, the cost of the legalization of money: 12 to 16 Thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="42">A fake registration, you can quickly and only for one and a half Thousand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not a registered user, and arise from then, cases of extortion.</seg>
<seg id="44">"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.</seg>

<seg id="46">Already on the day on which the law entered into force, it turned out that not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants be a fake.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some of the fake certificates, the completion of the tests to certify were already of the employees of the Federal migration authorities beschlaggenommen.</seg>
<seg id="48">The fake papers have an ordinary color printer printed.</seg>
<seg id="49">Of course, received the new owner of this for a good reason: Every Migrant, the hoped, so the Tests to spare, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is more than twice as much as the cost for the official Test: This costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Moreover, that the most important immediate task of the System against corruption, to protect, so the certificates will not be easily purchased, are both public officials as well as civil rights activists agree.</seg>
<seg id="52">For the Moment, the authorities of the guest-workers, the first Time through the Test fast, just promise that you have time for a Sprachgrundkurs.</seg>

<seg id="8">The Internet was an open letter published, its author - the representatives of different Waffenverbände - the authorities are claiming, "it is senseless tightening of the rules" to take distance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The percent of crimes registered weapons is very low, expressed the criminal lawyer , Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">According to the statistics of the Ministry of interior were 142 crimes with the use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012 committed, while for the same period, a total of 1,168 Thousand crimes were recorded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners Criminals do not discourage, to the black market to operate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently, the authors suggest that in Moscow every possible weapon for little money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, stresses the Ministry of the interior, that the spread of illicit weapons is under control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Supplier: from the factories to the officers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The weapons across multiple channels on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="16">There are five main channels, told a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, the ten years in the Ministry and in the General staff was employed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Screenshot of a web page that accepts Waffenbestellungen</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. Weapons during the fighting in the Caucasus have been stolen.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The weapons were both of the Russian officers as well as the Caucasians, even stolen," says Baranez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">On the second channel of illegal weapons, the police of Criminal stolen.</seg>
<seg id="21">Baranez explains that these weapons include, both from the armouries of the police, as well as directly by the employees of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Further illegally sold weapons come from military arms caches.</seg>
<seg id="23">Many military camps there was often a lot of explosions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There is evidence that in some cases, arson was, for the Lack of weapons to cover up," says the former military personnel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">A contribution to the black market to afford according to Baranez the arms manufacturers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Today, there are countless private Rüstungsfabriken, the international competition does not withstand, and therefore the weapons under the Hand on the black market, such as in Moscow, squander," said the expert.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another channel of the black market smuggling is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Especially a lot of pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is a own, sometimes craft production, and a Mafia, the smuggling organized," explained the former military personnel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">What is the origin of the weapons?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels of delivery of the black market in illegal arms about.</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2011, a report from the centre for problem analysis and state administration submitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the interior and the Federal service for state statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the topic of weapons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The vast majority of illegal weapons dates back to the investigators, according to the army and the Rechtsschutzbehörden.</seg>
<seg id="35">Half of all weapons on the black market were there by the "guilt of those responsible, in their work with weapons have to do," says the report.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">The data of the researchers, according to originate 17% of the weapons out of conflict zones, 14% go on thefts in the production of weapons back, and 5% originate from illegal excavations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">A salesperson of a Waffenladens that is not mentioned by name wants to be assured that weapons in illegal excavations to be found, long time, no one buys because they are obsolete.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">According to him, it is more likely that the dealer supplies in a weapons cache to get that.</seg>
<seg id="39">A warrant officer is a weapon, for example, a gun-type TT, purchased.</seg>
<seg id="40">The weapon is being issued and by the fence pass.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The dealer brings the weapon into the town, and sold it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">"The police know, of course, about all of it and leads therefore, if you Plan to the detection of crime do not meet periodically Kontrollkäufe with dealers, illegal weapons," adds the salesperson.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">"How in the Luxusladen"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Buyers and sellers will find the most well Known to each other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I had web sites and Blogs viewed as someone noticed me and I suggested to the Station "Begowaja", where a Person would wait for me, the me to a certain place would be where we are then, the price could negotiate.</seg>
<seg id="46">The price for the weapon, I have learned just there</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Militärkommentator Viktor Baranez</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"In order to find a weapon, I need a friend, contacts," said the salesman. "I have such a friend, but I trust him not".</seg>
<seg id="49">There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and with a Code to arrange such as "Ivan Ivanovich, the position, that the daughter lost a Tooth."</seg>
<seg id="50">I'm currently even to some of the knuckles of a friend, whom I trust.</seg>
<seg id="51">He gives me the knuckles also, only because he knows that I can't verpfeife.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Newcomers to search for weapons in different Ways.</seg>
<seg id="53">The former military Viktor Baranez tried in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, as he is an article on this subject I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Schemas have according to him, is not changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He got a photo album, in which "everything is Possible" was shown.</seg>
<seg id="56">"I felt like I was in Luxusladen", recalls the military.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The buyer gets loud Baranez not the cat in the Sack, but you can try it all.</seg>
<seg id="58">I, as a potential customer to buy not only easy, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we put a target on.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I can go there and shoot, and if I am convinced that the weapon a good shot, we negotiate with each other", describes the expert of the procedure.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="61">Internet search engines display search results to web pages and groups in the "Vkontakte", where weapons "for different purposes".</seg>
</p>

<seg id="62">There are no any paperwork required nor is it a personal Meeting.</seg>
<seg id="63">"You only need to have the appropriate sum of money", it is said in the advertisement on the website of the "Kampfpistole or rifle to buy".</seg>
<seg id="64">There, users specify your orders and requests.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In the United States to strike Fast Food and supermarket Workers</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Every fourth American teenagers sitting at some point behind the counter of Mc Donald's</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the past few days it came anywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and Restaurants popular Fast-Food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Still, no one can predict whether the protests still continuing to swell, or whether you again soon running out of breath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The protests by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations supported.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to the modest increase in the wages of simple Walmart - and Fast-Food workers pursue the organizers of the protests that aim to form trade unions.</seg>
<seg id="7">So far this sector of the economy hardly unionised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">46 Cents in the year?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, the USA sales took place, the millions of customers anlockten, which was sometimes to the Handgemengen led.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On this day, put some Walmart employees, of which it is globally 2.2 million, your work down, and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target group is people in low and middle income.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Walmart sells all the products, diapers about hunting rifles, and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.</seg>
<seg id="12">The goods in the Walmart stores is, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, buy many of the slightly paid Walmart employees at the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="14">The prices and the range of goods made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Critics, Walmart the goods are often the only reason why so cheap to sell, because the employees are poorly paid.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latter also complain of severe working conditions, for example, lack of forklift truck or hand-held scanners.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The participant of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their Anger about the contribution to the company's own health insurance from 30 to $ 100 a month had increased.</seg>
<seg id="18">A typical Wal-Mart employees, the 9.5 U.S. Dollar an hour deserves, could this increase can't afford it, they said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if the company the average wage on 12 Dollars an hour, it Walmart 3.2 billion Dollars would cost.</seg>
<seg id="20">These are approx. 1,1% more than now for wage donations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Would Walmart increases are completely on the customer to kill cost of each purchase you will only 46 cents more.</seg>
<seg id="22">Per year would be for you in comparison to today expenditure of only 12,39 Dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Proponents of Walmart provide satisfactory, that it is only in nine States to protests and this the company no losses brought.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Black Friday took in his Shop from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.</seg>
<seg id="25">In total, the Walmart cash on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an Interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that, overall, "fewer than five" Walmart employees the work down and the action of protest is "just another PR Trick" of the Union, the protests organized, had been.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Free Cash!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The protests went this week in New York, where your aim is not, however, Wal-Mart stores (in this advanced city not desired and, therefore, so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-priced Restaurants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">McDonald's says that the company sell a billion servings, and yet you have no sick time, and you will for your honest work is not paid!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York city Council</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Currently, the minimum wage in accordance with Federal and New York legislation at 7.25 Dollar an hour.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Fast-Food Restaurants is the minimum wage gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, get your easy employees in New York 8,90 U.S. Dollar an hour.</seg>
<seg id="33">Less than you deserve no one in this expensive city.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How it is possible, in New York with a little money to get along, is beyond me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">There was once a time in almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's behind the counter stood, however, the young people lived with their parents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income, or planning a longer stay there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Now meet me in Interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that you pay to get along, and sometimes even their children to feed.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the other hand, there are in the Forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal published a comment, whose author points out, it was irresponsible to have children, if you do not know, how you want to eat it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The participants of the protest on Thursday at 6 : 30 in the morning in front of the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashier and chefs of Fast-Food Restaurants, a minimum wage of US $ 15 the hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage corresponds to.</seg>
<seg id="40">They demanded to continue the formation of trade unions in the Fast Food industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">U.S. law prohibits the corporate governance, this is an objective way to stand and trade Union activists warn or to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, the corporate governance, it is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="43">The establishment of trade unions in the Fast Food industry, but also for objective reasons difficult.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most important reason is the high staff turnover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Dissatisfied</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The loud protests, there was on this day in front of many other Fast-Food Restaurants in Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The peak of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats languages, including Stadtratsmitglied Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's says it will sell a billion servings, and yet you have no sick time, and you will for your honest work is not paid!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The protesters were also of other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together in the Fast-Food employee support, so you can just receive wages and economic prosperity can reach every New Yorkers deserve!".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US-American Fast-Food industry.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, there were only a few Hundred people on the ground, of which by Far not all the Fast-Food industry in New York tens of thousands of work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Still, it is not clear whether the spark of these protests whole mass will mobilise.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">"The brain can so far only moderately outwit"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The followers of modern technologies popular topic of augmented reality in the last time, usually through the lens of a special glasses perceived.</seg>
<seg id="3">First presented to Google in the summer at its annual conference will be a working model, in November was then announced that Microsoft also a corresponding Patent had logged in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In an interview with the head of the group for interactive 3D-technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is apparent, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company's only a way station was.</seg>
<seg id="5">You are intrigued by the possibility of virtual objects into the air with his bare hands to manipulate and virtual spaces to create.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">- Please describe briefly the research your group operates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, with the aim, however, the limitations of this interaction expand.</seg>
<seg id="8">So far, mankind is mostly in the Phase stuck in with the pixels on the flat screens working, sometimes also to be touched.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, we want to 5-10 years of vorausblicken and the radical changes in this interaction to predict.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, the Xbox console and the Xbox Sensors progress, and today is no Xbox without Kinect sold, since all for motion control are interested in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- What awaits us in the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">- Although Kinect the interaction on a physical level, plays a lot of things on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.</seg>
<seg id="13">The input of information (the System receives more data) could be improved, the output is not yet critical.</seg>
<seg id="14">We try to change, work on real three-dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of different technologies, including projections.</seg>
<seg id="15">We have the world in our physical world are discharged and they are comprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="16">For this purpose it is necessary that not only the users, but also its environment is detected.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we could the real world much easier by virtual objects Supplement.</seg>
<seg id="18">And, first of all, we should be this stupid Virtual Reality helmets to get rid of!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- What do you think about voice control?</seg>
<seg id="20">It is popular, but it is not overrated?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">- It is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, since you have questions about the privacy issues, because you are not getting any bystanders about his actions and intentions would like to inform.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact any kind of interaction with computers is good, however, each in their particular niche.</seg>
<seg id="23">For example, we worked in the field of control of objects in public places in a project in which we have a short and concise, instead of sweeping Gestures experimented.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Gestures are not of the Objektkamera, but from a bracelet recorded the movements of the muscles and bones registered.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is still relatively large, could, in theory, however, on the size of a wristwatch be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="26">But overall, the future belongs to, however, mixed types of controls, for example, Gestures, and language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">- How come?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">- We would me ask you this Sprudeldose to be rich?</seg>
<seg id="29">You say it and point at the same time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">- Usually I say it simply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">- Does that mean you want that the user can log on to the contours of what a machine at any given time can afford and what is not?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.</seg>
<seg id="34">I think that we will in the next time, especially on the development of new types of sensors work will need to allow for the reactions of people to more accurately capture.</seg>
<seg id="35">This can, for example, laser sensors, as in the depth of a good resolution offer, which is very important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">- What are the demands set on the basis of their work with the Xbox Xbox Sensors in modern cameras?</seg>
<seg id="37">There is a lack of resolution, depth, or something else?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- The current Generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, would be 8 mega pixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad.</seg>
<seg id="40">But the main thing are not the Megapixel itself, but rather the quality of the Matrix and the depth.</seg>
<seg id="41">From this point of view all the current technologies for us, not good enough, because the developers of the Algorithms have more work to do.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is not only the resolution along the X - and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the speed and the number of images per second are important.</seg>
<seg id="44">The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and frankly, current 30 fps, in particular, for Gestures too little.</seg>
<seg id="45">Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, where the present-day commercial Sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).</seg>
<seg id="46">Not all understand how much of the interaction of man and machine is affected.</seg>
<seg id="47">For my work I needed just such a device, only without the touch and with more frames per second.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Should the number of cameras not be increased?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", where one of them is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected Signal.</seg>
<seg id="50">And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB-camera.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is not intended for calculation of the object depth.</seg>
<seg id="52">More cameras could possibly solve the Problem...</seg>
<seg id="53">Or the Problem intensifies as more calculations are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="54">Would be nice to be a flexible, Xbox similar System, in which we have a different Kameraneigungen could play, to see how we in the three-dimensional determination of a Position helps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">- If I remember right, presented by Microsoft, in contrast to Google his glasses to the Public.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, the glasses, the best prospects?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">- Of course it is not pleasant, out of a Smartphone in the raised Hand to hold, but I think the following: The best variant would be a "changing" augmented reality, when we have a Cloud of the glasses on the Smartphone switch could</seg>
<seg id="58">The glasses is a personal Gadget and therein lies their strength (Private, only you can see), but also their weakness, because an enhanced reality by means of glasses to prevent that, together with the Other virtual objects can work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- Let us imagine for a Moment that the Manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also accessible to mere mortals.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is a Problem, on the critics of this idea is often to point out: There is no sensible response!</seg>
<seg id="61">The hands feel nothing at all!</seg>
<seg id="62">What are the answers want your group to this objection?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">- In my Lectures I speak often of the fact that the reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I think the eighth breakthrough may well be the Integration of the tactile perception.</seg>
<seg id="65">An interesting method is currently the use of the second-Hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.</seg>
<seg id="66">It takes print perfectly true!</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are also technologies that actually are geared to the "images in the air" is something Tangible to give, for example, creates the interference of some targeted Ultraschallstrahlen in a certain point, where the Finger is, a feeling that at the moment but still so weak, as someone blew over the knuckles.</seg>
<seg id="68">There are also bands for the wrist, on the endings in the fingers impact, this is also a potential direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Have you tried the brain to outwit?</seg>
<seg id="70">It think that it can feel, what to feel it should, if it is just something that looks?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">- This is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.</seg>
<seg id="72">Here lies a further task, with the us for a long time have to fight to be, namely a person who is physically present in a closed room, believe he was, instead, in an open, practically infinite space; here, we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms, as well as large balls.</seg>
<seg id="73">So far it is the brain only moderately outwit, and we still have many busy years.</seg>
<seg id="74">This makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so appealing: On many subjects, we are only at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rosbalt is implementing the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", the citizens is dedicated to the avant-garde of culture and art form.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the select list landed already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, the success of which is beyond the borders of the city, and often recognition in Europe, not in the Rest of Russia to be known.</seg>
<seg id="4">The new Hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the Red-clad Bearded, once at the Russian Museum, once during the summer garden, times at the scene or on exhibitions there.</seg>
<seg id="6">Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller also be issued, they attract large crowds.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socially-philosophical artists, the new myths created.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s, respectively. At the beginning of the 90s.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is also a man of the city, and conjures up by his presence on the road to his fellow citizens a Smile on your face and provide you a good mood.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently, he grabbed a barrel-organ, and became the Petersburg street organ players, since it is for this challenging role with regard to his Künstlerdasein, his philosophy, and his Image, we are finally ready felt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">- Kirill, why are you always in Red and not, for example, in Yellow and turquoise in the city on the road?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">I have the color Red as a fashion designer, with the look and Image of deals.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this world, Red is the compromise between the artist, image consultants and society.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the society gets everything, what some of the Graunorm differs, aggression and bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I want by my provocations with the people into the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of my recent provocations was an invitation to the conversation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">- When did you know that you are a painter need to be?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of culture, in my Works were displayed.</seg>
<seg id="19">I realized that I go this way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Then was the time of the ancient free, however, not officially recognized painter at that time to the end, and the new and free painters like I were incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="21">I became friends with the artists of the new Generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; this resulted in "Pushkinskaya 10", and then was once an end.</seg>
<seg id="22">It takes me to a theatre, fashion, music, actually, to all, except the literature.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">And all this is United in your Art-clinic... - It was important to me, in the center of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists congregate.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the year 1995 hour I a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovation of a musical-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the St. Petersburg Boheme.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of them were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember, like a cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.</seg>
<seg id="26">Cord and his friends sang simple songs to the Play-back, wearing tight shirts and among them was also the now fashionable composer Igor Wdowin.</seg>
<seg id="27">As the group began to play live, was out of it "Leningrad".</seg>
<seg id="28">Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of the "Halli-Galli".</seg>
<seg id="29">We gave them Trachtenberg, and there began his great career, but the principles he learned in the us.</seg>
<seg id="30">Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art clinic.</seg>
<seg id="31">Went there for our staff and regulars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I am a Hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the year 2000, there were in the press survey, when it comes to the award of "personalities of our city".</seg>
<seg id="34">I won in the category "artist of the year", and so I was at the peak reached.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not easy, in the new times, according to old rules to work; I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the present time, it is easy to be famous, but the culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous, without a cultural contribution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">Your Works have a distinctive style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring clearly the timeliness and clarity of the thoughts expressed.</seg>
<seg id="39">I'm going to an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".</seg>
<seg id="40">Clowns are timeless.</seg>
<seg id="41">I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be that way.</seg>
<seg id="42">In a Clown blurred all and loses its tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="43">I love the Grotesque, and I've grotesque ideas.</seg>
<seg id="44">We save, for example, the world, we require that each fully to dress up.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now pays each on the clothes and is based on the Outer and the Inner of the people.</seg>
<seg id="46">But perhaps you may a people not to shake the Hand, but he should spit in the face.</seg>
<seg id="47">The illusion disappears through the Dress.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">- Recently we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - A city of culture should be as a hero.</seg>
<seg id="49">Who, if not I?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">- Can also commercial art to be beautiful?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">- These days, commercial art, careful, considerate and flattering.</seg>
<seg id="52">We see the collapse of the cultures.</seg>
<seg id="53">Earlier, formed the people of big groups: The Bohemians loved the One and the simple people of the Other.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now, there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone.</seg>
<seg id="55">I'm not one hundred-dollars-Note that appeals to everybody.</seg>
<seg id="56">Now you need to consider who you like will.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now everyone has cult star about 100 followers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">- The performances of the Stas Mikhailov come but several Thousand!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">- To come to him deserted women, plays in the sexually-social sphere a role.</seg>
<seg id="60">For cultural reasons, 300 persons and 10 Thousand, consequently, there are fewer Management, money, and all perish.</seg>
<seg id="61">I have the trailer, and the most Important thing is for you not to cheat and Reached not to destroy it.</seg>
<seg id="62">In my youth I used these pictures to be painted, the case of a collector, even in a row with the works by Falk and Larionov hung.</seg>
<seg id="63">I began with images normally only at the end of the career.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.</seg>
<seg id="65">It means: spiritual culture, and culture.</seg>
<seg id="66">Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something quite different.</seg>
<seg id="67">I am a man of the past culture and grew up with the artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money refused to paint.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is the culture I am advocating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">- Good Culture Experts.</seg>
<seg id="71">One says: servant of the culture.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, not all of them can deal with culture.</seg>
<seg id="73">The real Tsar was different, because the Tsar understood may not be much of a culture, but they understood that the right experts are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="74">In Moscow, there are currently good adviser.</seg>
<seg id="75">In St. Petersburg we have what, the experts could be, but you, the way is blocked, because it hochrangigerer experts demand that the Former properly evaluate them and clear the way.</seg>
<seg id="76">Now it is only your own taste.</seg>
<seg id="77">The same is true for the Erarta, however, with the difference that you honestly say that you are not all contemporary art accept and some painters therefore, other museums have to search.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">- What is available for you to Petersburg?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow, there are much more culture and a suitable breeding ground.</seg>
<seg id="80">On our stones, art is difficult to grow.</seg>
<seg id="81">We need a cultural soil, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is still not right.</seg>
<seg id="82">In Europe there are many curious people, exhibitions or concerts.</seg>
<seg id="83">In the us are much less.</seg>
<seg id="84">Art must again be modern, as well as to the beginning of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The project is from grants of the city of Saint Petersburg financed</seg>

<seg id="4">Caravans of ships with people of planet earth to embark on the search for a Ersatzplaneten.</seg>
<seg id="5">To save humanity, poses the important question of how we in the weightlessness, or on the Ersatzplaneten can reproduce?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Many choices there are in my opinion not.</seg>
<seg id="7">De facto, there are only two real planet, we at least hypothetically could inhabit.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">However, while the conditions on Mars comparatively Pro, there are on the surface of Venus at a temperature of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Life would be only in large amount, or in the orbit of Venus, so in All possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The question of reproduction in All treated the researchers first in terms of the Flora.</seg>
<seg id="12">Already half a century before were experiments with plants is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fourth Generation of the in Orbit cultivated peas does not differ in the least from the terrestrial species.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was followed by the breeding of insects, specifically by tiny fruit fly (Drosophila), in Orbit.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 1979, quail eggs were sent into outer space, in order to explore how the microgravity on the development of Embryos effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It develops a normal chick.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then, the Problem begins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Problem is that the chick Just have to find it; it must be on his legs and start to move forward," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without a solid ground began to spin the Chicks wild.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Chicks did not react to light and Loud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Four days later, they died then simply.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Twice we left the Chicks hatch and made the Whole thing, simply because it is impossible for there to work with them," believes Vladimir Sychew to the failed Experiment with the chick at All.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The last Brutkäfig with animals flew 16 years ago in the Orbit.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the spring of 2013, the experiments continued.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, on the Biosatelliten "Bion" only same-sex species.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">It was an Experiment with rats, the already fertilized sent into space.</seg>
<seg id="28">In principle, it was nothing Special is established.</seg>
<seg id="29">"That was just with the Biosatelliten, but again it was only a single Experiment, and the research must be continued", noted Vladimir Sychew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">After landing got the Weltraumratten offspring.</seg>
<seg id="31">The problems of the reproduction right in space, you can not solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="32">The task is difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Animals from their natural habitat to be torn, you can simply your reproductive drive not follow.</seg>
<seg id="34">In contrast to animals, man could the principle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Homo sapiens is to Think in the abstract capable and can have a similar emotional Background to create.</seg>
<seg id="36">From ethical Considerations, such experiments are not carried out.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, women are already flying since 50 years in space.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The biggest risk, there Tereschkowa.</seg>
<seg id="39">The most Valuable thing mankind possesses is the female organism.</seg>
<seg id="40">Our Seagull flew away, and no one on the earth would have to answer the following question: can Withstand the space flight?</seg>
<seg id="41">It is after this flight a child into the world?</seg>
<seg id="42">"After all, no one answered this question," says Raumfahrtveteran Vakhtang Watschnadse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In June 1964, only a year after her space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, a daughter.</seg>
<seg id="44">The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.</seg>
<seg id="45">In 1988, gave birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaja, which twice in Orbit, and even Work outside of the spacecraft performed, a son.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, still remains a risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights, everything went well and you healthy were young.</seg>
<seg id="48">"The more, the more dangerous it is for flights into Orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">And yet, the mankind must for new Ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial Gravitation are looking for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">The Hydrolabor in Vorbereitungszentrum of cosmonauts is a mandatory Station during the flight preparation.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here, in a state of uncertainty win the cosmonauts Routine for the work in open space.</seg>
<seg id="52">The water represents the weightlessness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment; however, infants perception of water as a natural Element.</seg>
<seg id="54">It is as if the small Ichtyander testify, that the life of the country stepped out of the ocean.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months in the womb of the mother in the amniotic fluid is, and that it is easier for water to get used to.</seg>
<seg id="56">In principle, this is logical, because from birth up to the first Swim just 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="57">"This is too little time to do something to forget", says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">While for a newborn child weightlessness so a much more natural condition, the woman is not without gravity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">In the state of weightlessness forms the abdominal and pelvic muscles very fast back and this also increases the ability of the child to say.</seg>
<seg id="60">Well, we can avoid this by geburtseinleitende AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="61">The birth could also, for example, in a Spezialkammer take place around the child to say.</seg>
<seg id="62">"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery Polyakov.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">On the other hand, does a child need also artificial gravity.</seg>
<seg id="64">Without the earth's gravity to feel the organism, the skeleton and the muscles do not develop.</seg>
<seg id="65">A newborn child can be in Orbit, not as an adult Training in a Belastungsanzug be plugged in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">It is simply the absence of what his life is of vital importance.</seg>
<seg id="67">"This Experiment, which together we make, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to a disabled person, a totally non-conformist people to the world will bring," says the head of the Bioethikkommission of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">So far, the birth of children in the universe is mere theory.</seg>
<seg id="69">At some point, but it is reality, if the man of the earth in their spaceships to a distant planet to leave the home for her in the All-born descendants.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">NKÚ-chief: control of the Black-system failed due to the fault of politics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Czech Republic has in connection with public contracts, on good Policing and adequate laws, but in their application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In the conversation for, Welcomes says this is the Vice-President of the Highest Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case for us," commented Kala the current Situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A similar result is apparently a common control by Czech and German examiner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As a negative example, he leads the setting of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to suction. "Black-System".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Recently told the Prime Minister that the ODS, the entrepreneur does not have controls that would harass - the System is now prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="8">"A law must however, its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then you can not just the heads of government, and the Kontrollamt, whose duty of the control of the observance of the law is, in its activity hinder", provides Kala.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">At the meeting of the audit Committee of the chamber of deputies, they spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in the framework of the laws of both countries with regard to public contracts were compared.</seg>
<seg id="10">What was it exactly?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">It is a parallel audit, with which we started some two years ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Simply put, it is a matter that the European legislature determines how public procurement to handle. This is the Foundation of the national legislation. And finally, there are the actual practical application.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">All of this, we have compared to each other, and although the inspection is not completed, we were able to very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws in the us, maybe even a little bit "strict and perfect", the actual application, however, is in Germany, in a number of parameters better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">This confirms that it is not sufficient, always new and more detailed rules. You must also with the actual application of the Right deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To what extent can the project be of help? What emerges from this project?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Just such a common control that could help us to stop us constantly to perfect the laws and the reduction and Balancing of thresholds to try, if this does not appear to be particularly positive effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to purchase and illicit enrichment or even criminal acts to exclude.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Perhaps it is even so that we, the System in this way only with excessive "paperwork" charge, and those who are gaps in the System, it will be much easier for the System to take advantage of, as if the thresholds are higher remained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">You talk about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does the monitoring system in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a similar authority, such as our NKÚ, or the System works differently?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What the authorities concerned, as is the German equivalent to the NKÚ the Federal court of audit, the similar structure is as it is and also about a quorum, which is only slightly different is formed. Generally, both authorities, however, are similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The competences are to a certain extent, comparable, although Germany is, however, a Federal state, which means that this audit offices also in the individual Federal States are - this is what distinguishes the German System of our.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The BRH may only Federal control what our state funds equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="26">Public funds, at us from the districts and municipalities are managed, are subject to the control of the courts of auditors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">What the German legislation is concerned, is the simpler than ours?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In General, I would do this without concrete information is reluctant to compare. However, in Germany, in some ways, often as a model referred to, although you certainly can't say that Germany in particular, is better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Is it because that there examiners are better?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">That certainly is not, but as I said: Such comparisons, I may not particularly like.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is still, it should be noted that even those countries, which are an example for us, also have to deal with problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise you would have nothing to work with our authority, isn't it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">What the Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance of your authority in the amendment of the procurement law, do you feel any impact?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Considering that this amendment only a short time in power, it seems to be in our tests so far have not.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since our controls subsequently take place, you have to do here with a certain delay is expected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Impact we feel far more in the preparation of future checks - so we have the new mechanism of control "detection of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts reviewed and analysed here are the Changes, of course, have an impact, since the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of calls for tenders have been modified, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">You will see the adoption of this law is rather positive, or is the System with further burdened by bureaucracy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">However, there may be the Problem, that the rules of "strict" and no longer can be met.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under the previous rules are a test constitutes persons with regard to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational program of regional policy, the regional Council), accountable to the effect that any non-compliance with the procurement law for a breach of discipline).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is then reasonable to the law is even stricter to make?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">In my opinion, not in this way.</seg>
<seg id="43">The System must be the ones to exclude the System to attack and misuse want to, and does not punish those who have a formal errors have been committed, on the actual decision-making has no effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Such a System requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Where is the way out?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">We say, first of all, what is not required.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS, the entrepreneurs with inspections of the sog. "Black-system" would bother - what does that mean exactly?</seg>
<seg id="48">Is the Black-System is now prohibited or allowed?</seg>
<seg id="49">A law must however, its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then you can not just the heads of government, and the Kontrollamt, whose duty of the control of the observance of the law is, in its activity hinder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">He can say: "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do so, as if nothing was the matter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The Vergabegesetz contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and that is for the protection of the public contest correctly.</seg>
<seg id="52">On the other hand, it is also tragic, if the bidder with the best deal solely because of formalities have to be excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">The law will never be perfect, but it needs to be properly applied and that is what we, in my opinion, is missing.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">What do you think about that in less than a month of the end of the world is supposed to take place?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is one of those disaster reports, on which we humans are so happy to pounce.</seg>
<seg id="4">With our Band The Tap Tap to make us more about fun and say that we are the only Band in the world are enough positive energy can use to collect the end of the world to stop or prevent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In December realize there is also a unique project, with three concerts against the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can get to our readers the project closer to imagine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It is a national charity, we have already been two years in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this, we want the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar to use, the end for the 21. December at 11:10 am in the morning forecast.</seg>
<seg id="9">The day before, i.e. on 20. December, find from 21:00 o'clock at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.</seg>
<seg id="10">The end of the concerts will be in approximately the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone to 12 hours before us is that the Mayan calendar ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Who came up with this idea?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Originally from me, then we have the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta developed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here, we would not only sufficient positive energy, to collect the end of the world to prevent, but we also want to be together with the Public think about it, the condition in which this world once our children to pass.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have a unique collection of shoes, T-Shirts, bags and key fobs against the end of the world to be developed, with their purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people also can support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The Band the Tap Tap, together with other artists also the so-called. Anthem against the end of the world with the title "end of the world falls out."</seg>
<seg id="16">Today is the anthem on YouTube is very popular. It is also to the benefit concerts, resound?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Of course, in the very end, assuming that all goes well and the doomsday will not take place...</seg>
<seg id="18">The anthem is supposed to be from all of the performers on all three concerts at the same time, are sung.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the hymns together in a direct circuitry by the Czech television broadcast live.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Text of the anthem comes from Tomas by HANAK, who is also the main character of Jesus in the video clip is playing, also Xindl X sings with...</seg>
<seg id="21">How are they to the cooperation with the two of them?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which related to the fact that we have many Fund-raising events and concerts...</seg>
<seg id="23">We strive to keep these people intensively in our projects.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has been shown, that the majority of working with us are interested, and have some fun with it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">What is the purpose of coming to the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world benefit from this?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">For the establishment of a barrier-free educational centre Studeo, we had been six years, together with the Association Tap in the Jedlička Institute work.</seg>
<seg id="27">The students of the Jedlička Institute regularly editors looked after them in different activities to help.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since the students themselves do not have the means to the editors to visit, we want to give you this way to help.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is supposed to be a private building, in which we then use this project to move in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">At each concert will encounter several groups and performers.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to what criteria have you chosen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We wanted a program to compile all generations, including children appeals.</seg>
<seg id="33">In Prague occur, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiri Suchy.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the details are on the website www.kpks.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Are similar "major events" is also planned for the future?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In may, we get for the first Time during the Prague spring, and also for this concert, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year we would also like to be in the Czech house in New York occur, and I personally, as if we had time, in the USA - this would also be happy with performances in Washington and Chicago connect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Their plans abroad are not just small, so far, they are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow occurred.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities is composed of.</seg>
<seg id="40">How do they cope with this travel logistically and organizationally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="42">Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs need to be transported in the Luggage compartment. In addition, we must, of course, many an instrument case and other Luggage to lug around...</seg>
<seg id="43">Nevertheless, so far it has always worked without problems, CSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I am sometimes, sometimes even surprised me.</seg>
<seg id="44">Even in Moscow, where we recently, there were no problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Through their travel abroad, you will have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility looks like, how to get there, people with disabilities, deals, etc.</seg>
<seg id="46">As you have these things been experiencing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, in which everything works better than us, we were just in Russia witness that in the East, everything is still in its beginnings.</seg>
<seg id="48">Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for the disabled. There it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is not even, of course, that you can use a wheelchair, for example, in the Elevator vorlässt.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fortunately also arise there, clubs, trying, on the problems of people with disabilities should be noted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">And in what respect we must compared to the more developed countries catch up?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">There are many things in which we hang behind...</seg>
<seg id="53">But still, it should be noted that an improvement of the Situation always depends on the Efforts of the parties Concerned.</seg>
<seg id="54">In London and Madrid, it is very common that people with severe disabilities independently in the public space to move, go to the Museum, toilets can use, etc.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it is not common that there is a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in the social events involved, we're with the Band The Tap Tap the West a little ahead!</seg>
<seg id="56">Respect in the Public and accessibility is one thing, but only if from our ranks significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, are things really start to change.</seg>
<seg id="57">So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The Tap Tap is currently very popular. If we have but a few years back: What was in the year 1998 motivated to start a Band?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">At that time I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I have a lot of young people met who were interested in, and with a little intense.</seg>
<seg id="60">And since I myself am a musician and others. Saxophone games, I, together with a colleague, a music-AG was founded.</seg>
<seg id="61">Well, and with the time it is like our Moderator, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say, a bit out of control (laughs).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Became known the Band, but only in the last few years, or am I wrong?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">It is true that for us to cooperate with well-known singers has helped; in addition, we have also started to actively for us to advertise.</seg>
<seg id="64">We are aware that, if you are doing anything, and this is outward is not visible, the own performance, in a sense, does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="65">Thanks to EU funding can we also good editors, high-quality equipment and etc afford.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Their aim was it with The Tap Tap so far as to bring?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">From the outset I have the Potential felt that one way of doing things.</seg>
<seg id="68">In show business, copies today often one to the other.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is on his way, logically, since everything New considered with caution and only after some time will be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="70">There are only a few of the really unique things, and I would venture to say that Tap Tap.</seg>
<seg id="71">The first impression of the audience usually has, of course, is pity; this is only natural...</seg>
<seg id="72">But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings, we regret to have to.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are people who have a full life to live and to develop, if you have the necessary funds.</seg>
<seg id="74">I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only for itself a step forward, but for the whole society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">It was for this success is also helpful that you have a strict boss, how many people listen to?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">If you do something good, want to make, you may in many things not compromise and must also have a certain discipline in demand.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is, in my opinion, but it is completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="78">Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you then find that you twice a week sample preparatory stages must complete and a lot of time on concert tours to spend, then turns off the enthusiasm of many fast.</seg>
<seg id="79">So it works but everywhere, in each Band, the work seriously and want to achieve something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Currently, The Tap Tap twenty members.</seg>
<seg id="81">How many of them were from the very beginning, i.e. since 1998?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Only one: Láďa Angelovič.</seg>
<seg id="83">We are an open group. People come and go. This can't be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="84">Those who have the will and the desire to Join with us is always welcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Takes place on the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday, 20.12.2012 to 21 PM</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The locations are: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech Bands and other musicians</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">All three venues are to end by Live circuit connected to each other and it is a common Interpretation of the hymn "end of the world falls out" of the Band The Tap Tap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">The aim of the concert is the means for the equipment of a multifunctional accessible educational centre raise, that, under the name STUDEO in Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 Million. CZK</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland and the outer space.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Last week Poland has been on a Ministerratssitzung of the member States of the European space Agency (ESA) as a twentieth of a member of this space Agency added. Poland is the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic on 12. November 2008 ESA member).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with ESA, and participated in the following years several ESA projects.</seg>
<seg id="4">The path of Poland in the space began admittedly much earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Already before the Second world war employees Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space, although this does not always met with understanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">I remember, for example, the speech of A. Šternfeld from 6. December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work "entrance to the Astronautics" was presented.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ideas of the young engineer (geb. in 1905) let the listeners, however, cold, and after years remembered Šternfeld still, that only Dr. Jan Gadomski interest in his work had shown.</seg>
<seg id="8">Šternfeld won in the year 1934 for "entrance to the Astronautics" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch donated Prix REP-deer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Gadomskis worldwide-recognized contribution to the development of the space was, inter alia, thereby acknowledged that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Already in the year 1925 was in Poland a railway trolley built for a rocket engine was planned.</seg>
<seg id="13">The author of the draft, and the Details of this project remained unknown unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is not even clear whether the rocket to Start or to the deceleration of the trolley should be used.</seg>
<seg id="15">The information is sourced from the contemporary press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Began in 1933, the Polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen Shot to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research, led the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia, in collaboration with prof Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.</seg>
<seg id="18">From the surviving documents, it is obvious that the research into the stage of practical Tests penetrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The research was then certainly by the invasion of the German Army interrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">In the year 1937 appeared in the trade press by Ing. Rohoziński originating draft of a photoelectric Jagdrakete on, and in the following year appeared to be the work of "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.</seg>
<seg id="21">Both of these projects dealt with the military use of the Raketenantriebs.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shortly before the war, all the projects were for military use the rocket from the Temporary scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinates.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Committee was set up in 1937, after two years of activity, has been his work, however, from the beginning of the war ended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">For more articles about space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.</seg>
<seg id="25">The first mention of this company shall be in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major part of the space dedicated to it.</seg>
<seg id="26">The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the time there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was to be expected that the exploration of outer space, would have a future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Already in its early stages, in the year 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accession to the 1951 based International Federation for space, and, in fact, the PTA already in the autumn of 1956 ordinary member.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the following year became the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Vice-Chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.</seg>
<seg id="30">This office, he had, until his death in 1959 held.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Since 1956 involved in the PTA instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.</seg>
<seg id="32">The first type, the RM-1, was established in 1957, completed the first launch took place on 10. October 1958.</seg>
<seg id="33">The rocket with a maximum flight altitude of 1800 m was approximately 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="34">Later, an improved Version, the RM-1A, built, and in 1959, began in the Błędów desert flight tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.</seg>
<seg id="35">The rocket was 1.4 m) long and weighed about 11.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="36">A further stage of development should already be in the position to real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should an altitude of up to 14.5 km away, and for the observation of Höhenwinden used.</seg>
<seg id="37">In 1962, however, was the further development of the set.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was in the years 1962 to 1965 developed Meteor-1 rocket.</seg>
<seg id="39">The rocket was as Zweistufenrakete designed, their total length amounted to 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of this missile were three types have been developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and 1C), differing from each other in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments are distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Meteor-1A-rocket had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C about 0,62 litres.</seg>
<seg id="42">The maximum flight altitude of fraud in all three types of 37 km.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the years 1965 to 1968 in the aviation Institute the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight in October 1970, began.</seg>
<seg id="44">Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km of freight.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later versions of Meteor-2 and Meteor-3 built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960, two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee followed.</seg>
<seg id="47">Poland participated in the context of the inter cosmos programme in space exploration with Soviet satellites, and, in 1978, the Polish Pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimír Remek second Interkosmonaut.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The repeal of the law on non-profit Work is not a solution.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the last week highlighted the constitutional court the law on non-profit Work.</seg>
<seg id="3">This decision called for in the Public a lively discussion.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is interesting that the problem from a wider perspective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">In effect this means that the individual national economies in a state of permanent conflict.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of the Privatkapitals, with the rampant financial speculation goes Hand in Hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) it comes to Preisspannungen.</seg>
<seg id="9">Under this term is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying, through the importation of cheaper Goods in the economic competition by the competition "undercut", and thus a larger share of the market to usurp and its profit increase.</seg>
<seg id="10">On a large scale, this means that most of the companies, their production abroad to transfer or buy low, or your business to give up. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labour costs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since the private capital is no social responsibility, and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused carries rise necessarily government spending.</seg>
<seg id="12">This Situation is strengthened by the fact that the men entrepreneurs absolutely're reluctant to pay your tax and thereby caused by them wider economic and social damages.</seg>
<seg id="13">This Situation is commonly known, so that concrete statistics at this point, are superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="14">The ruthless practice of Privatkapitals creates in the individual economies, a Situation in which the governments will be forced to compete with each other to come to the social level of the population artificially reducing foreign capital into the country to attract.</seg>
<seg id="15">With other words: The governments of supply its own population without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is reflected, in particular, Changes in applicable laws.</seg>
<seg id="17">The aim of these measures, it is its own population to force the dictates of the Privatkapitals in particular in the wage sector have to accept.</seg>
<seg id="18">This happens by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other, by the circumcision of workers ' rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-larger differences between the Poor and the rich.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany, there are already several years in public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for arms, which no longer are able, through their work to feed.</seg>
<seg id="21">The number of those Affected is already in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the course of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy it regularly to cases in which workers such low wages that the state your income up to the subsistence wage increase.</seg>
<seg id="23">Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employees assistants revealed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The austerity measures, virtually all of the EU southern States will undoubtedly be on the same condition as result, the people are under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as it is in the 19. Century was the case), or for a pittance at the edge of society to starve and to hope that at some point private investment capital to flow into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">Here is urging naturally, the question of how this capital comes?</seg>
<seg id="26">If it is from another EU-country, migrates only the poverty of a country to another; or the capital remains the same, quite, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa work at all, the workers for a fraction of the European wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">This applies to the whole of Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="28">Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam, that the state is not with capital to its own economy involved, and that planned to Wirtschaftskatastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Private capital insists narrow-minded on his point of view, that the state is not directing in the economy allowed to work.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then you have to ask yourself whether or not the private capital of the policy and thus the entire state in its own selfish purposes influenced or even directs.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here is the definite answer: Yes.</seg>
<seg id="32">The proof of this is the existence of a practical Almighty and in all States ubiquitous Lobby.</seg>
<seg id="33">The result is a desperate Situation in the area of corruption, the mutual preference, a law in which virtually all reprehensible, but nothing is punishable.</seg>
<seg id="34">In Germany the Situation is such that a Ministry of state for lack of finances private, closely with the industry interwoven Rechtsunternehmen with the elaboration of draft laws commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="35">These draft laws are then in the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="36">All violence is then no longer from the people, as it is the Western constitutions proclaim, but of strong financial groups, which have their own interests prefer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Obviously advised the liberal democracies currently quickly in a Situation such as that Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in times of Caesar and Pompey' describes: "The state has long been in decay terms, and the Offices were with violence occupied.</seg>
<seg id="38">Against bribe, unlawful procuring of benefits, or with stone and sword.</seg>
<seg id="39">The corruption rampant uncontrollably, and the people went with already purchased voices to choose" ... "people with character competed not for Offices, so that the government as a result of this decline in eight months, no Consul had" ... "You began really to talk about, that is the only medicine in this difficult Situation-a dictatorship, and that a strong man to be elected must be"... Appian thought at Pompey, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, the democracy permanently by the dictatorship replaced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">As it turns out, is based today's society, as well as in ancient times on the reckless preference of one's own advantage, and without the interests of society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="41">Private capital is already by its nature is not in the position to the benefit for the whole of society to recognize and enforce them.</seg>
<seg id="42">The result, today, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, not in the Least to more in-depth reform effort.</seg>
<seg id="43">The cause for the emergence of fascism and communism, we must therefore, in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. Century look.</seg>
<seg id="44">From the present state of view, can be the downfall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies as a certain Pause to be considered at the next round already emerging.</seg>
<seg id="45">Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites in future possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, humanitarian and social disasters, we witness today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we are from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="46">The repeal of the law on non-profit Work here is not a solution, at least not lasting.</seg>
<seg id="47">Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition will the Czech Republic be forced to continue ways to search, to the social level of the population to press down.</seg>
<seg id="48">This Trend is therefore due to the system.</seg>
<seg id="49">The only solution are targeted political and social reforms which the equity participation of the state in the economy, increasing the influence of the citizens on the government to increase and the monopoly position of the Privatkapitals in the society in favour of the state of weaknesses.</seg>

<seg id="7">For me it is important that the readers look behind the Scenes, to open your eyes to it, to whom the 95-year-voltage (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patches of Land in the Middle East especially helpful.</seg>
<seg id="8">My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived of these and go from my own understanding of them, who or what group of people, the events of the modern history influenced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for Power.</seg>
<seg id="10">In each epoch, we can Alexander the Great, or a Napoleon of the total.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is less apparent is the question whether it is really getting these people were, their steps Autonomous specific, or whether behind her throne one was, of their actions on a predetermined goal directed.</seg>
<seg id="12">We must acknowledge that we are living in a period, in which the wealth of the world in the hands of very few Single, concentrated, and that this concentration of money and the resulting Power is not within the life span of a Generation has arisen.</seg>
<seg id="13">Under these astronomically rich families stands out particularly, the man as the head of the octopus may call (I don't know whether you or anyone, I close this but not from) - the Rothschilds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Much is not written about them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Understandably.</seg>
<seg id="16">The first press Agency (Reuters) has been the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19. Century purchased in order to connect your Name with highly criminal actions to prevent, in whose Background is always the consolidation of their Power, and the growth of their assets, or both stand.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Rothschilds are at almost all Central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not at the Central banks are involved, make war or preparing to this (before the Invasion of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the Invasion of Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis were only four, with Russia in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government places).</seg>
<seg id="18">Whoever tries, this family to resist, had to take the life to pay for it.</seg>
<seg id="19">Abraham Lincoln refused the Status of the Rothschilds Bank of America as a Central Bank to renew, began during the civil war, its own (i.e. state) Bank notes are to be surrendered and was in 1865 in a Theater murdered.</seg>
<seg id="20">J.F. Kennedy started their own banknotes are to be returned and wanted the FED to abolish he was assassinated in 1963; the Deputy Louis Mc Fadden in 1936, poisoned, after he FED due to the triggering of the world economic crisis in 1929 wanted to sue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The global lust for power of the Rothschilds resulted in 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a Plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert spades, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first war, had the goal of the large monarchist Staatenwesen of Europe to eliminate, by the second war, should, in particular, the colonial rule of great Britain will be broken, and the third war, the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people reduce (such number would be for their amenities and luxury of worry and would also not consume a lot of resources), a Universalreligion create (Ecumenism here is nothing more than the first) and finally to the Takeover of absolute Power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top of works, is triggering a crisis, and then offer a solution (order from chao - order out of Chaos).</seg>
<seg id="24">These solutions are wrong and lead to worsening of the Situation (see the founding of the FED, to crises such as those of you in the year 1907, when triggered, will not repeat).</seg>
<seg id="25">After it to you by the murder of the Habsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo had succeeded in the First world war, trigger, they destroyed the Russian tsardom by the Revolution of the Bolsheviks.</seg>
<seg id="26">The First world war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist Empire, the war was no longer required), then, was the resolution of the Central European nation of Austria-Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="27">About the Second world war easier kindle to be able to let the bankers by the policy of a latent conflict situation by Germany with gigantic Kriegsreparationen occupied; as a result, they created the condition of poverty-stricken masses, so that the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader to foist had the culprits named and simple solutions offered; another factor was the creation of the Vielvölkerstaates Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which has the function of a fifth column should take and also took to the Kriegsbrand to ignite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">At the end of the 19th century. Century, the Rothschilds, the founding of the Zionist movement, in the case of a branch, the establishment of a Judenstaates sought, as far as possible on the historical territory of Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).</seg>
<seg id="29">The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first clashes with the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="30">Terrorist attacks, there were on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Second world war broke out, and if Hitler of the chain losriss, to him, the international bankers initially had held, or whether everything went according to Plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, created the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.</seg>
<seg id="32">Israel was established in 1948 founded, and as well as by the Kriegsreparationen against Germany, the ground for the Second world war was prepared, is the proclamation of the state of Israel, the creation of a focal point for the third world war.</seg>
<seg id="33">If it is the international bankers will succeed in this unleash war, the Jewish people, similarly as in world war II victims in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="34">Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and Chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharp the people of supporters and opponents of Israel divide).</seg>
<seg id="35">Who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only wrong in an endless spiral of violence triggers, where at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of a global Power?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Here, between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders differ, set but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates for election.</seg>
<seg id="37">The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Benjamin Netanyahu, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, the international bankers, loyal, devoted politician, who do everything to a war with Iran to kindle, which in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), rapidly developed into a global conflict might be enhanced, and in which, due to the control of Iran, about the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, about 20% of the world's Erdöllieferungen run, to a destruction of the world economy might come.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In what light there appear the words of David Rockefellers from the year 1994: "The only thing we need is an overarching crisis, and the people of the new world order is welcome."</seg>
<seg id="39">In their conception of the new world order, a world of masters and slaves.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Film Argo: When it's at its worst, Hollywood call</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In November 1979 occupied a Mob demonstrierender Islamist students the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.</seg>
<seg id="3">For their release, they asked for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the Revolution, in the USA, who had fled, for decades the patronage of his Regime maintained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">For the American government gave it out of this Situation no positive way out - you could not afford it, the Shah to throw overboard, because this is the trust of its allies in other countries massively damaged would have.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, she was not able, in Iran, where the Revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime that led to the release of the hostages to enforce.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco, when a violent attempt of the hostage release made it worse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The caught taken diplomats were finally after 444 days released after negotiations by the Algerian government has been taught.</seg>
<seg id="8">The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity, as well as antiiranischer moods.</seg>
<seg id="9">The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter's against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in the year 1980.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Film Argo of the Director and actor Ben Affleck describes an Episode of this story, the USA a small Teilsieg brought.</seg>
<seg id="11">Immediately prior to the occupation of the Embassy managed to six Botschaftsmitarbeitern to escape.</seg>
<seg id="12">This ended after many complications in the residence of the canadian Ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="13">The CIA succeeded in cooperation with the canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; it helped them an extravagant Story to mask their true identity - they traveled with canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, the supposedly in the country filming locations for a Science-Fiction Film visited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Combination of Genres</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The experts of "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed Plan was also made by the cooperation of Hollywood required.</seg>
<seg id="16">So the camouflage became credible, articles appeared on this film project in journals, there were press conferences are held, and the fictitious manufacturing company had a real office.</seg>
<seg id="17">The details of this Operation have been long kept secret. The Film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, he is a more realistic political Thriller, but at the same time, a so-called. "Caper Movie", that is the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as, for example, the Film Ocean's Eleven.</seg>
<seg id="20">This change in the Film the Stimmungsebenen - on the one hand, the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence to be iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the Filmfassung the same situations, there are no major differences).</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and slightly exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="22">And then there are the scenes from the CIA Headquarters and other institutions, such as the men in suits at the conference table, on the Amtsfluren, on the phone...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ben Affleck is with this Film is a remarkable restart his career succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="24">From a dismissed actor is a respectable Director and as an actor, he is now no longer the goal of ironic comments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Argo is his third feature film after the crime is Not an easy job ("Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).</seg>
<seg id="26">At the same time, it is Afflecks first movie, not in his native Boston is the Director's plays.</seg>
<seg id="27">The feel for the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, this film Director from the Standard Hollywood took flight.</seg>
<seg id="28">Affleck proves this sense, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played".</seg>
<seg id="29">The best scenes of the movie playing in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that actually took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the Embassy is in its Clarity to be very impressive, and it provides nevertheless, the feeling of confusion and uncertainty that occurs when somewhere once the story moves.</seg>
<seg id="30">A similar effect can be achieved Affleck with his Team in fictional scenes (the wrong stage crew scared at a Bazaar in Tehran).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Too much action in too many places</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The Director had to face the fact that the story is actually not many in the cinematic sense exciting scenes.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the Few works he, however, quite successful, but he reality is sometimes a little nachhilft - what then is not always so elegant effect (the scenes of the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a phone call in America is averted, or even the car chase on the runway, seem a little contrived).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, by the need is caused, to a lot of action in too many places, the need to show.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their role as Hollywood-staff very charming, their figures, however, would more space earned, and they are in the Film is far from alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Afflecks Film loses a bit of traction. It is a Film you with some degree of interest and the design, construction, and to a Thriller from the 70's. Years reminiscent of Retro-style of truth.</seg>
<seg id="37">Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a reminder of a until today in some way living piece of history, and as proof of this, as covered but the ideas of the Almighty and all-knowing intelligence services are, however, he is sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="22">How do you solve this Problem?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As a simple citizen, I've used the guide a free trade remains, and this could be enforced.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Problem is the small-minded policy - if someone is right or to the left with a good proposal, is this deliberately rejected, and this keeps the population only.</seg>
<seg id="25">As an independent Parteiloser, I possess a much greater potential, support of all parties represented in Parliament to win.</seg>
<seg id="26">My advantage is that I no stereotyped thinking and Parteidogmen of each party can take, what our country is the Best.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do you see yourself as a human being in politics is rather right or left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people get me more left to see.</seg>
<seg id="29">For me, this is Right-to-left Thinking, but it is completely unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="30">For me it is important that we move forward.</seg>
<seg id="31">I'm not about whether someone to the left or to the right of the stock belongs to; I would like to connect people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Always I support the public every good solution, even when this is the KSČM or from the ODS comes, and also, I will myself against bad ideas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">It displeases you, if someone you as populists referred to.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, confirm that you want, not what you have just said?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">If you are in a company, a business plan to set up, then you have also an ideal goal and a Vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">And this, you want to approach.</seg>
<seg id="37">You can do this for my sake as populism call, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world already, or they were of key experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But without support in Parliament, leaving you with only keywords.</seg>
<seg id="39">And so they come into politics in the long term is not far away.</seg>
<seg id="40">Or do you think it's you, if you just long enough to talk to the people, will succeed in, for example, the material and criminal liability to enforce it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">I have no other option.</seg>
<seg id="42">Politicians, journalists and the Public to convince and to try them on our side to bring these objectives to enforce.</seg>
<seg id="43">As President, it would be no Problem for me, the Chairman of the parliamentary live on television to ask the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors by law to anchor.</seg>
<seg id="44">And the target would then may say, why you refuse.</seg>
<seg id="45">A strong personality, the grievances indicates that can put pressure on the political scene exercise.</seg>
<seg id="46">Take the direct election of the President, the credit to the public pressure was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">I say quite clearly that I am an Amateur; I am not a genius, nor an Intellectual.</seg>
<seg id="48">I try allies for my views and visions.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the policy, I have only just started and try, for my program the support of the majority.</seg>
<seg id="50">I try to keep things to judge for themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I go to six years in the private sector back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">That sounds a little, as if Okamura the Czech Republic should save.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">I'm not a Savior.</seg>
<seg id="53">I know that I alone nothing reach; so I have with several well-known personalities talked about, if you do not also for the Senate election.</seg>
<seg id="54">For example I have with Radim Jančura spoken, however, due to heavy workload, he refused.</seg>
<seg id="55">I also have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová supported the fraud in the trade of light heating oil revealed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">My candidacy, I began with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but for now, I'm not sure anymore.</seg>
<seg id="57">Sixty percent of eligible voters are not at all the elections have gone, and those that are gone, mostly representatives of the Establishment chosen.</seg>
<seg id="58">In the Senate, we are only two Independent.</seg>
<seg id="59">The people have such a Senatszusammensetzung that Changes is very difficult to be enforceable.</seg>
<seg id="60">Anyway I'm going for my visions to fight, for example, for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Think about starting your own party?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Furthermore, I have not thought of, because I have no time, the past of each potential Parteimitglieds to check, and also do not have the money have for it.</seg>
<seg id="63">I don't even have money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account are only 20.000 CZK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">You have no money?</seg>
<seg id="65">You speak of asset declarations, how would your from?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">My personal expense and I estimate that about 60 million. CZK.</seg>
<seg id="67">In Prague, I have a plot of land with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, with a further 8 million, an art collection, which is about 10 million value, as well as the Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, about one Million of value. And then I've got a couple of million on the account.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Aston Martin was the way a child's dream - James Bond liked me, always, as he drove the car galant to women and at the same time, fought Evil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">You will drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?</seg>
<seg id="70">They say that the Republic want to change, but your own money, you do not want to invest in it.</seg>
<seg id="71">This is not exactly convincing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">I have no 15 million for the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="73">Should I make debt?</seg>
<seg id="74">I have already 2.5 million in the campaign plugged in.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that I have no sponsors have, shows that my program is probably not very much interest.</seg>
<seg id="76">And I am not obliged, the campaign from its own resources to cover.</seg>
<seg id="77">The cost of the campaign are basically by my salary as a Senator covered.</seg>
<seg id="78">But from the Senatorengehalt alone, I could not live; so could I, for example, my son is not the English school Finance, the 30,000 per month costs.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I only wanted to earn money, I would go for nothing-election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">So stay continue as entrepreneur, in order to make a living?</seg>
<seg id="81">They said not that these activities back?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">But that has nothing to do with the amount of the salary.</seg>
<seg id="83">As promised, I have my activities partially reduced.</seg>
<seg id="84">For example, my Deputy in the spring of managing Director of the travel Agency.</seg>
<seg id="85">The people want me as a Samaritan see, the Republic of Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="86">But I have to live from something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">To which monthly income, they were used as an entrepreneur?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also continue to be so.</seg>
<seg id="89">As President, I would set my endeavors, however.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The MVRDV architects to prove that the real adventure is not only in the head - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently established Bücherberg - 2 photos</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">"I think the building is funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the road.</seg>
<seg id="3">And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large-scale enterprise, says: "But that is nice, it already, the house."</seg>
<seg id="4">But I wonder why we still have a library need.</seg>
<seg id="5">All have Internet, iPad, and E-Books.</seg>
<seg id="6">No man is still voluntary in one of these Old-Style libraries, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Spijkenisse, a barely besichtigungsbedürftige dormitory area of the city on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is odd to-head record.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 80,000 inhabitants, the municipality has the lowest Bildungsrate the whole of the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="9">To this stupid fact counteract, decided a few years ago, to General education and to contribute to the seven fictitious bridges on the Euro banknotes are shown, as pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen to build.</seg>
<seg id="10">The success of the educational campaign was limited.</seg>
<seg id="11">And so, gradually, the city fathers, that there is only one way would be, of the statistics to be Lord of: A library must!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Winy Maas from Rotterdam architects MVRDV, master of daredevil bar charts and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual Calmness, and appeared for the competition-Hearing anno 2003 with five books under her Arm and a Grin on his face.</seg>
<seg id="13">And while the Jury is still taken aback to be looked up and shrugged, put the naughty Maas his fine gifts according to the size of a pyramid, and ended his action was supported speech with the words: "love municipality!"</seg>
<seg id="14">So that's it, my suggestion for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Nine years later, is the 30-million-Euro mountain piled up.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts, which also includes underground Parking, supermarket, Post office and a few adjoining residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the beginning of November was the Bücherberg with the second prize for "Best Library of NL 2012" award.</seg>
<seg id="18">Furthermore, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 nomination.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">This is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte, which until now, not had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly town hall, behind the white facades, one would be inclined, a dairy factory, to suggest, to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.</seg>
<seg id="20">But above all, has Spijkenisse now over the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The long way to the book</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The first impression: Büchereldorado under Käseglocke.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although there is a Lift, right through the mountain, but the true space - and Lesefreuden open themselves to the ordinary Climb to the topography.</seg>
<seg id="24">The fully glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned Klinkerboden and the elegant street lamps speak clearly the language of a public square.</seg>
<seg id="25">The urban environment is perfect.</seg>
<seg id="26">You already keeps a lookout for a Park bench, a dog and a soccer-playing boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="27">And everywhere books, books, books.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, the most uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have the classic room configuration is placed on the head and the reading from the inside to the outside covered.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Interior of the Bücherbergs is cleverly used: In the centre there are offices, Internet, library, chess club, environment centre and HV unit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A special joy to the black bookshelves, the times, wall covering, time parapet, time Stiegengeländer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Look, feel and smell are alien.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even hard-nosed architects and civil engineers shaking of the unknown construction material of the head.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We wanted to here with the use of recycled materials in our work," says Joop Trouborst, project Manager at the borough of Spijkenisse, at the request of the Standard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And so we are in a friesländischen commercial farm one day on a suitable waste product from the agriculture encountered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Used for many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields millimeterdünnes nonwoven synthetic as Wurzelunterlage.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is cheap and efficient.</seg>
<seg id="38">The thin textile holds two seasons, and then it is ready for the trash.</seg>
<seg id="39">For the library was the fleece - for the first time in this amounts to four inches thick plates are pressed.</seg>
<seg id="40">Under heat and pressure, if the so-called Landbouwplastic (CLP) to a dark, homogeneous, resistant Material, that a bissl for new cars and a little after sports Shoe smells.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">After 105 steps you have reached the summit.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of the almost 500-metre-long wandering in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with the Dutch croquettes and potted Ficusbäumen rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="43">They provide for the atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in the Literaturgebirge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Donations for the new soul</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"You would not believe, but this house is in spite of a lot of glass showcase in terms of Ecology," says Trouborst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Heated and cooled with geothermal energy.</seg>
<seg id="47">Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz, the sun shines even on Sunny days only briefly into the Interior.</seg>
<seg id="48">The wide wood-glued rafter, the perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as shading and catch a majority of the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="49">The indoor climate is very pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Rest is done by automatic blinds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, dared are already on the way to the new library.</seg>
<seg id="52">Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.</seg>
<seg id="53">And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even as Spijkenisses "long overdue soul".</seg>
<seg id="54">The reason: For the opening of a few weeks ago, every resident invited to a book from his personal inventory to donate.</seg>
<seg id="55">It is intended for the time being, once the optical gaps in the not-yet-fully-stocked library currently 70,000 units - to be filled.</seg>
<seg id="56">The concept worked.</seg>
<seg id="57">The shelves are filled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.</seg>
<seg id="59">"I think, thanks to our invitation has now every inhabitant of a certain relationship to this new house.</seg>
<seg id="60">Everyone knows that his book is part of this building is.</seg>
<seg id="61">And if it's only for ornament.</seg>
<seg id="62">This is MVRDV those ultimate succeeded, in the jargon of establishing an Identity is called.</seg>
<seg id="63">Spijkenisse has history of literature written.</seg>
<seg id="64">So young and uneducated, you also may be.</seg>
<seg id="65">This is finally a starting point for identity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Szabo: "Germans have a larger role to play"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Germany has in the vote on the admission of the Palestine of the voice.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, poised Berlin on a narrow diplomatic degrees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Welle: in the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it is against the application for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations would agree.</seg>
<seg id="5">But then contained Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Stephen Szabo: Germany supports, what the Israelis in Gaza have done, not.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now Germany is due to its special relationship with Israel, however, to be careful.</seg>
<seg id="9">But at the same time, I think, that it is also not the American Position is supported.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without, however, is critical of Israel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstain, as it was a matter of a no-fly zone to be set up.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was finally a NATO-enforced.</seg>
<seg id="13">It falls Germany hard, on major international issues a clear Position to take?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Yes, that's true.</seg>
<seg id="15">The reason is that it is just his foreign policy surrounded and while away from a policy, so to speak, of the United States managed, to a German foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Complicating this is the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Germans found between the fronts against.</seg>
<seg id="18">You are expected by you that you have a more independent role to play, because they are not accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="19">I think you keys to their role approach, but you are on the way to a more ' normal ' foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="20">A foreign policy, such as France or the UK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">What does a ' normal ' foreign policy concretely from the German point of view?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">It shows the willingness of national interests, positions, to relate to, which are independent of those of the us or European partners.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that the German foreign policy of the economic policy is motivated, so of exports, and its relationship to specific regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="24">Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from that of the other great powers, and therefore, Germany has its own interests to protect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">These economic interests impact on the attitudes in the middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefore, it must be wary of the Public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, not from the head to come across.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is definitely a role.</seg>
<seg id="29">But I would not be too much weight to do, this is not entirely one-sided relationship.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it is definitely an important role in German Considerations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Germany has its relations with the United States corrupted by it in making important decisions of the voice contain, for example in the vote on Palestine?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">I think, in Europe and even in the USA there is great understanding for the German Position.</seg>
<seg id="33">Therefore, I do not think that this is such a dramatic break was, as in the Libyan question.</seg>
<seg id="34">Perhaps, therefore, Germany is even a certain respect for import.</seg>
<seg id="35">Because it indicates, however, that it as an international player to be taken seriously, and his interests have to be considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In Europe, there are different opinions on the Palestinian Initiative.</seg>
<seg id="37">The United States, by contrast, have clearly for a Veto pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European Nations?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Due to the American domestic politics have these differences will always exist.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that the Obama administration secretly probably pretty much understanding for the European Position.</seg>
<seg id="41">But due to the political Situation here, can the government Position publicly, of course, is not represented.</seg>
<seg id="42">I believe that the actual differences are not so great as they appear.</seg>
<seg id="43">If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so thrilled by Netanyahu's policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">It falls Germany hard, its close relations with Israel and the us on the one hand, and the Position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side to agree?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of course it would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy would be, which is not currently the case.</seg>
<seg id="47">So you can't be part of a broader line and must instead things from their own Position going forward.</seg>
<seg id="48">Do you precisely with the Euro.</seg>
<seg id="49">I think, in the future, Germany will play a leading role in Europe a European Position to push.</seg>
<seg id="50">This is of course not just for Germany, because of the relationship to Israel.</seg>
<seg id="51">That was always a delicate topic.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I believe that the German it is clear that a more independent role to play.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Looks Germany itself in the role as a major international player wants to Germany play a major role?</seg>
<seg id="54">Or falls Germany, the Leadership still hard?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and, for obvious reasons, it falls to the country is still struggling, a greater role to play.</seg>
<seg id="56">If we, for example, the Euro is to look at, because every Time when Germany play a greater role accepts a variety of anti-German feelings freely.</seg>
<seg id="57">This makes it the Germans were not easy.</seg>
<seg id="58">This is actually the old Problem: you don't want by hostile countries surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="59">Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult Position than the United States.</seg>
<seg id="60">It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Now, the influence of the USA in European politics continues to decline, the EU fills in the Moment of this vacuum but not, who remains as otherwise?</seg>
<seg id="62">The Germans will be easy to play a greater role.</seg>
<seg id="63">Even if you don't like, it you uncomfortable and you have a lot of unpopular power - c'est la vie!</seg>

<seg id="2">Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what is Armani Polo?</seg>
<seg id="4">This is based on a China officially registered name, however, nothing to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen has to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nevertheless, it enjoys as long protection, such as the actual namesake't complain.</seg>
<seg id="6">And even then, it is not clear whether they will get justice.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is for foreigners are always more difficult, their brands in China to protect", says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney with the law firm Taylor Wessing, on rights in the far East is specialized.</seg>
<seg id="8">Each week, lands a new case on my Desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The imitators enough to have seen a few extra letters, so that their brands are allowed to log.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada makes you Prada-Kny enter.</seg>
<seg id="11">German companies also in this way are legal copies, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark office in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 14. September 2010, let there be a Chinese company, the trademark Zegna DF Puma protect a name, which is also the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna served.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The fact that the Chinese world champion in the Copy, and in the infringed intellectual property, is well known.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the large cities, there are multi-storey Department stores, which are almost exclusively sell fakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Pattlochs cases, but are different: on behalf of his clients, he goes on the other hand, that Chinese companies by the trademark office officially received the right to a name, to use the already elsewhere is protected.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a Beifahrermarke.</seg>
<seg id="18">The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus, women are meant, which is rich men fishing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Chinese authorities are aware no one to blame</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"This is bad for business, you have to overcome it", calls Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The brand is diluted, the unique position disappears, the image is enormous."</seg>
<seg id="23">The financial losses and the costs of the proceedings of the affected sectors are in the millions, especially in the case of expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the market research company CLSA's China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third-largest market for luxury goods and the fastest-growing.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, deletions dubious entries in the register of marks are difficult to achieve and go into the money.</seg>
<seg id="26">Up to nine years is the method to last, with an uncertain outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pattloch reports of cases in which the court abwies, because of the long duration of the disputed Name to the "market reality".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">If the plaintiff bad luck, he must have the plagiarist even have to pay money, because he is its brand in China injured, says Pattloch.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Famous cases also concern the graphical elements.</seg>
<seg id="31">2009, Daimler has a dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister took over.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chinese may, therefore, is today an Emblem to use the Mercedes star is similar.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Volvo buyers Geely used originally a blue-and-white Logo, the BMW remembered; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashion brand Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction could.</seg>

<seg id="35">The Chinese authorities are aware of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="36">The trademark office CTMO in Beijing that it there in 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment of the rooms bottlenecks have given.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the past year was, however, one of the "emergency situation in the workflow returned to normal".</seg>
<seg id="38">So, the stock of raw, unprocessed opposition to 22 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="39">Almost 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, waiting in the office still 81.500 objections to completion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Address costs a lot</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">As so often in China the Figures are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the past year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, which is almost a third more than in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="44">This is a record and means that China, for the tenth Time in a row, the list of the registrations all over the world, giving the authority will notify with.</seg>
<seg id="45">This also applies to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million pieces.</seg>
<seg id="46">2011 would be 1.8 billion Yuan in fees had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="47">Simplified means that each application on average, 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Address costing many multiples, such as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.</seg>
<seg id="49">For more than seven years of fighting, the group against a Chinese plagiarist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Although the Germans could reach that his illegal manufacture of imitation auto parts was dug.</seg>
<seg id="51">But secured the imitators continue to the Chinese rights to the mark Freudenberg.</seg>
<seg id="52">You yourself have failed, because in Germany surname is not protected and could be said Hanno Wentzler, the Chairman of the Board of management of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="53">The trademark office CTMO dismissed the objection of the Munich because even back.</seg>
<seg id="54">In the next two instances got Freudenberg right, but the opposing party is fighting until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">You must be extremely careful</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Now is the matter before the Supreme court of justice.</seg>
<seg id="57">Wentzler is confident that the thing to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and it cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."</seg>
<seg id="59">The internal costs were almost impossible to quantify, the company archives have even one hundred years old files browse need to proof.</seg>
<seg id="60">Five years ago bot Freudenberg the other side, in vain, a "high six-figure amount in euros" for the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Because you can see how much the value is", says Wentzler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">The dangers in the far East, threatening even to Europe zurückzuschwappen.</seg>
<seg id="63">Then, if there's imitators, unprotected brands secure.</seg>
<seg id="64">So wanted a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, the term Freudenberg for shoes and leather log on.</seg>
<seg id="65">This area of business, the group has been abandoned long ago, yet he was able registration to turn away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.</seg>
<seg id="67">Both he and the attorney Pattloch rates German companies do business with China very careful.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is not rich, international trademark rights to leave, rather, should the foreigner "everything that is somehow worthy of protection, even in China, sign in", as Wentzler says.</seg>
<seg id="69">Otherwise, the much more expensive than the registry.</seg>
<seg id="70">In fact: If Freudenberg in the last act of his Markendramas subject, then you would have probably the opposite side of royalties for the own names, numbers, explains Wentzler.</seg>

<seg id="22">For almost ten years is exercised by the choir of the songs in this strange soft language and brings you now and then, back to where they originally came from: the South of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because 8 733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg away, in the Northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni by the loud voice of the German Choir depends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Forty percent are infected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">About 2000 people live there, some even in simple clay and straw huts, a majority of whom are children.</seg>
<seg id="26">More than 300 of them have no parents, because this is the HI-Virus in the dust.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Esitjeni shows up in the Small, how very Swaziland suffers from the highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.</seg>
<seg id="28">Circumcision of the male foreskin, the risk of transmission proven to reduce by half, by the population hardly accepted.</seg>
<seg id="29">More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency Virus, with mid-thirties to die is not uncommon.</seg>

<seg id="30">At a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, discovered by the choir of the village, above all, but saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, where it is not only parental care was lacking, but simply to everything: food, clothing, education.</seg>
<seg id="31">Without a school in a poor country, it was only right not a Chance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Initially, it was still the private commitment of Individual, for a few euros in the year a child to school to send him a warm meal a day.</seg>

<seg id="34">Facts about sexually transmitted infections</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?</seg>
<seg id="36">The bacterial STI include Syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.</seg>
<seg id="37">Common viral STI, HIV, Human Pappilomaviren, genital Herpes or Hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pubic lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen?</seg>
<seg id="40">Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily in men who have Sex with men.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Robert-Koch-Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all in Germany, reported Syphilis cases through sexual contact between men be transferred.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, cancer, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and Humane Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
<seg id="43">The spread of HIV is among heterosexual adults in this country are relatively low - nevertheless, Some 20 percent of the new HIV infections are attributable to this group.</seg>
<seg id="44">Among youngsters of chlamydia infections is much more likely than other population groups.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to European surveys cover three-quarters of all infections are young people between 15 and 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="46">In this country there are also the Human Pappilomaviren when young people are often before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">How has the number of infections developed?</seg>
<seg id="48">Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.</seg>
<seg id="49">The number of Syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch-Institute of 1697 diseases in the year 2001 on 3698 diseases in the year 2011, more than doubled.</seg>
<seg id="50">The number of new HIV infections have been declining since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="51">in 2011, there were about 2700 cases.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is about one-tenth less than the year before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">What are the signs of a sexually transmitted disease?</seg>
<seg id="54">Infectious diseases can ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during Urination, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal, as well as blisters or warts cause.</seg>
<seg id="55">Often they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">How can you protect yourself?</seg>
<seg id="57">Condoms can the risk of infection to reduce, but does not wholly protection.</seg>
<seg id="58">Because, in part, the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases also by smear infections and close physical contact to be passed on.</seg>
<seg id="59">Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequently changing sexual partners regular studies.</seg>
<seg id="60">Diagnosed early, most STI healed and long-term consequences can be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">Through sponsorships, donations, and last but not least, the fees, the choir in the whole of Germany into existence, comes a lot together.</seg>
<seg id="62">"In total, we have about 200 000 Euro after Esitjeni sent," says Annette Lennartz, the Chairman of the Association.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the village itself, managed Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and excellent woman, the funds from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="64">You also cares about the orphans find good, in one of the grandmothers about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The Gogos, how to get to the old women on Zulu calls them, are the Pillars of the village.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some of them have up to 14 orphans shelter, give them a roof over your head, and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day, just in time for school to appear.</seg>
<seg id="67">Anyone who has come into the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman, the same way the club is paid as the two cooks every day for more than 200 hungry kids cooking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">In addition, "Voices for Africa", a sewing school launched two Hühnerhäuser built and together with the American health organisation, PSI organized that many in the village of a HIV-Test.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is not a matter of course, because, obviously, the disease throughout the country, you are silent you most like to be dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A king with 14 wives</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">"Aids is a taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's to do with sexuality."</seg>
<seg id="72">Really strange in a country in which the king officially 14 wives holds.</seg>
<seg id="73">The last absolute Monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, king Mswati III., for his excessive Lifestyle known.</seg>
<seg id="74">Polygamy instead of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Among other things, it is this state-sanctioned way of life due to the HI-Virus in the past decades as quickly spread.</seg>
<seg id="76">But also the many migrant workers, the Virus through the country.</seg>
<seg id="77">Free condoms were, while it on every corner, " says Annette Lennartz, "but they are rarely used.</seg>
<seg id="78">The culture is different - flesh to flesh."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">As to cultural exchange something to promote, travels the Imbongi choir every two to three years jointly by the South African and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, Confidence, and black self-confidence, which many at the southern tip of the continent yet from the times of Apartheid know.</seg>
<seg id="80">A Bus full of White, the songs in a black language singing so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has also been some fierce border guards a few tears uncovered from.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">The journey will always after Esitjeni, where the singer of her godchildren visit.</seg>
<seg id="82">Also if you take the small village on the maps impossible to find, in the valley of the Ezulweni river, it is more than well known.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Goes after Esitjeni, there is light" say to the people there.</seg>
<seg id="84">And if you 8733 kilometers in a straight line to Heidelberg returns to the pounding of the singers in the rehearsal room at the Bergheimer Strasse, then you see it also as fixtures.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Our insight into space: The most important telescopes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The telescope should 1608 by Hans Lipperhey have been invented before Galileo Galilei it a year later to Sternenbeobachtung began.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes become larger and larger and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.</seg>
<seg id="54">The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.</seg>
<seg id="56">It makes looks into space over two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - alone in the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented in order to save costs.</seg>
<seg id="59">Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about eleven metres.</seg>
<seg id="60">The disadvantage of cheap construction: The telescope is in his elevation lashed, and so in his mobility is limited.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is in the angle of elevation fixed.</seg>
<seg id="62">Its special feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.</seg>
<seg id="63">This ranges, namely - despite a comparatively low mirror - the world's largest optical telescopes approach.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">With the help of a radiotelescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) listen to researchers All for alien signals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.</seg>
<seg id="66">In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), each computer owners to help, by computing power is available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.</seg>
<seg id="68">Here is the Very Large Telescope - his name.</seg>
<seg id="69">With its total of four Mirror can the telescope also the middle infrared spectrum lighting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope planned.</seg>
<seg id="71">His primary mirror should whopping 42 meters and almost 1000 mirror elements put together.</seg>
<seg id="72">With images, but at the earliest in 2018 is to be expected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Until 2007 were the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">They offer two mirror each with an average of ten meters.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, next to you with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF in the sky looks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope, with a mirror average of thirty meters.</seg>
<seg id="77">Here it is on an Illustration to marvel at.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">The most important impressions from the All, however, provides the Hubble space telescope.</seg>
<seg id="79">Since the 24. In April 1990, it provides pictures of the far-off worlds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Since March 2009, is looking for the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets - especially to those which are habitable.</seg>
<seg id="81">On 2. February 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn were determined.</seg>
<seg id="82">In the picture are the final launch preparations at the space telescope Kepler documented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the earliest in 2018, on Board a Ariane5 rocket into space shot.</seg>
<seg id="84">The primary mirror of the Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="85">One of the tasks of the telescope: It should be according to the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big Bang are looking for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">Scientists assume, that even at the South pole of the mercury ice exists.</seg>
<seg id="87">However, there are no reliable data, because the Messenger far closer to the North pole to the planet orbits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">Radar measurements have for decades been suggested that it is on the mercury ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="89">By the 2004 launched Messenger probe - the first, to the mercury orbits - the scientists have now certainty.</seg>

<seg id="16">For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours, because the road is only one lane.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fabled wealth of the country, its Oil in the Caspian sea owes, is here in the province has not yet arrived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the potential to be a tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Baku was in may with the Eurovision Song Festival, famous - and in the next year we have here is a Festival of the oldest people in the world", says Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">She is the Director of the Museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, documented, older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a Black-and-White photo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Here is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the age of 136 years ago, a child fathered</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But the controversial Star of the Museum is the shepherd He Müslümov, the 168-year-old should be.</seg>
<seg id="25">A birth certificate, however, there is not.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in the face of the oldest documented people, the 122 years old, appears Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in 1805 he was here in the Region, born in 1973, he died," explains Fatulayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The man was married three Times and was 23 had children, at the age of 136 years he still has a daughter who have witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Has He Müslümov so in his old age, at a couple of decades will be charged?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But Rembrandt Scholz, Researchers at the Max-Planck-Institute in Rostock, of the Aged in Central Asia belongs to.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Quite a lot of hochaltrige people, there are also some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia life is extremely lots of very old men".</seg>
<seg id="32">Because of the lack of documents is, however, no scientific evidence about the age, to lead, particularly since the civil registry were missing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Every day becherweise melted Butter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">But the fact is that the people of the Region around Lerik remarkably often, a biblical age.</seg>
<seg id="35">Currently, there are 20 persons older than 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="36">So why live here in the South are so many very old people?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.</seg>
<seg id="38">Curator Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is up to the diet of the table.</seg>
<seg id="39">But that of all the high calorie diet of the Talyschen to be so healthy, meat, bread, and especially dairy products, love and many of which are a daily glass of melted Butter drink, appears from the nutritional point of view is just not plausible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Or is it the original way of life, the people are young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.</seg>
<seg id="41">With its 97 years, it is for these Latitudes is still relatively young.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mirzayeva, the claims, 143 descendants, who lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.</seg>
<seg id="43">She is sitting on the ground with a butter churn, you tirelessly out - and ist rolling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both of which are long-grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also two young children jump around.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the kitchen to prepare the guests with tea, in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu lenses is served.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Rank and file, under her headscarf hides long, dark blonde braids, her son pride before us reveals.</seg>
<seg id="48">I have my hair is always washed with milk, so they went, I never made and kept their color.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Shampoo I've also never used", says Mirzayeva.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Monthly pension is enough to live</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">She has just eaten, what of your own yard, and was, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.</seg>
<seg id="52">My whole life I have not a single Time in the supermarket food purchased.</seg>
<seg id="53">Then, she tells her husband, who was in the army.</seg>
<seg id="54">At the worst it was in the period after the Second world war.</seg>
<seg id="55">But anything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">The Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.</seg>
<seg id="57">But the cult to the father of the Nation is driven to his country as a dictator ruled that knows no limits in Azerbaijan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Until 2003, he was in Power, and later was taken over by his son, Ilham, the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="59">After all, there is no Need of Azerbaijan Old.</seg>
<seg id="60">230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros), receives Mirzayeva of a monthly pension, for local circumstances, an amount that you can live very well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">And maybe has also Mirzayevas long grizzled son of law: "The Old enjoy in our culture, respect."</seg>
<seg id="62">You are living in the midst of the extended family, to be loved, cared for and are happy.</seg>
<seg id="63">If no reason is, as long as you can to stay alive</seg>

<seg id="1">Rakfisk from Norway: this Is the übelriechendste fish in the world?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe, but all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">Could the secret of the success of the country's something with the local appetite for quite smelly fish have to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Take a selection of over ripe cheeses.</seg>
<seg id="5">One place you in the midst of a pile of dirty, humid sportswear.</seg>
<seg id="6">And leave them there for a week.</seg>
<seg id="7">So about you nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk imagine, one of the great delicacies of Norway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo airport.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is snow, spectacular scenery and these persistent smell in the air that just will not go away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Rakfisk is with salt gritted trout, which - depending on how smelly his fish would like - up to a year in water is fermented.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">If in Norway the darkness of the Land and the weather becomes colder, currents Norwegians to a Festival here in Fagernes, the this, now, is really very impressive specialty is dedicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"You have to eat it raw, and rinse it with a glass of Aquavit down," says Havard Halvarsen, which is actually in the local fire station is working, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General of the Festival.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Around us people consume small Fischwürfel and take this large amounts of alcohol.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Mansche people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Spirit can smell displace.</seg>
<seg id="16">I taste some appetizers.</seg>
<seg id="17">If one is to avoid the Rakfisk in Nasennähe to bring, he is not bad - such as Sushi, which quite a long bus ride behind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no refrigeration, gave and fish in the autumn in airtight Salzwasserfässern was soaked.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the dead of Winter, he was then, after a long fermentation removed and will no doubt use of alcohol muted senses consumed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Even a Generation ago, saw thousands of Norwegians on the search for work, forced to leave their country and emigrated, mainly to the USA.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Today's population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not too long time ago, far richer was as Norway, streams of immigrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Rakfisk is as something Important regarded as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy.</seg>
<seg id="25">But actually it is here, Yes everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a Sandwich costs proud of 10 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Norway does not create it often in the world media, and most people don't seem to bother you.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Here hates you have it still, Different Breivik to call it by name - those racist right-wing extremists, the last year 77 men, women and children shot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Instead, one refers only to the "incident of 22. July".</seg>
<seg id="29">Norwegians do difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country to such a brutal murder is capable of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The main reason for the today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest Oil - and Gasindustrien the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"But Oil is not the only reason why it is so good to us," says Anna, our waitress, round tablet with Mature Rakfisk is distributed, and with her long blonde hair, and piercing blue eyes the Nordic Ideal is embodied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">We are a - how to say - prudent people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Your English is just like that of most people here spotless.</seg>
<seg id="34">We are not very pretentious, we don't like bragging.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Norway is using his oil wealth to be very carefully handled - a large part of the Branchenerträge is for the benefit of future generations in a special Fund invests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As in the years up to the world economic crisis all the money around threw that you do not possessed, held Norway his purse tightly closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"As long as, in Winter we go skiing and in summer Hiking can go, we are happy," says Anna.</seg>
<seg id="38">"And, of course, Rakfisk food", adds them with light-hearted Laughter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">I stand in the snow and put me on another court - by Rakfisk I have enough.</seg>
<seg id="40">So a moose Burger is definitely something else. The succulent flesh next to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">But in the evening it is time again for the Stinkefisch on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several venues, a Rakfisk Dinner organize for the guests for the best - or perhaps the Geruchssinne the most challenging - fish can vote.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a Live-TV-circuit to a Fly-clad host, the plates with Rakfisk is surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="44">The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Juergen?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"Here are our points, Havard".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">You clapping and laughing.</seg>
<seg id="48">A man falls out of his chair, possibly from the Aquavit overwhelmed.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He faces a complex task.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons has Mexico economically well-to prove, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, in the last six years we have 60,000 lives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"My government is strongly committed to ensuring that violence is to reduce," said Pena Nieto the beginning of this week in the Oval Office, the US-American President, Barack Obama.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">I'm going to have a new security strategy suggest that we can achieve this goal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Before he with the US President on an equal footing, it was Pena Nieto, Governor of his home state of Mexico to act.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this densely populated large part of the country, the capital city that surrounds it, are the opinions about the new head of state is divided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A direct man</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">In the remote town of Valle del Bravo one remembers, for example, to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Residents of the resort write to him, the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="16">To the city, on one of the highways go, Pena Nieto had built and a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads represent, as it once was.</seg>
<seg id="17">Plaque with his name also hang out outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive, interactive Museum for climate change.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"We expect him to be real and lasting changes", his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, as a Congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI works.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In particular, what is the security and the economy is concerned, we hope to have an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After 81 years in Power was the PRI in 2000, Vicente Fox replaced.</seg>
<seg id="21">Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside of the Präsidentenpalasts of Los Pinos great expectations Enrique Pena Nieto.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accusations of the Opposition, the new President, it lacks in substance, he dislikes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">He was a very direct man, very committed and have big plans for the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was a great statesman, especially, but he was also someone who can listen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">But on the other side of the heads of state do not share many people have this view of their former Governor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater.</seg>
<seg id="27">The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico city itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And the problems in the community are of critical urban nature.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the beginning of this year the military power on to in the neighborhoods operating to fight drug gangs, and violence against women is a particularly acute Problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">On a patch of wasteland near a large landfill were alone in the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women left behind.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto were in the state of Mexico over 1,000 women murdered - a statistic that even in the city of Ciudad Juarez exceeds that for their violence and the murder of innocent women is notorious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that it is the Problem of the Frauenmorde during his term of office, at least not adequately addressed.</seg>
<seg id="33">But in the worst case have his government their eyes to the issue closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In a concrete construction, typical for the run-down quarter, fights Irinea Buendia with tears, and when she told me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows.</seg>
<seg id="35">The official Version of events, according committed Mariana 2010 suicide.</seg>
<seg id="36">But her family believes, that of your significant other was murdered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.</seg>
<seg id="38">There were signs that she was beaten, and the rigor Mortis had already been used.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">While her mother was her story, looks down from the wall a picture of Mariana down on us. It is next to a cross attached to a single word: justice.</seg>
<seg id="40">But exactly this, so the family, I have to get out of her until now denied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The authorities have treated me as if I was a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.</seg>
<seg id="42">You want to get your judgment simply accepted and the mouth holds.</seg>
<seg id="43">"But this is not possible, when there are so many flaws and omissions were," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">If President Pena Nieto, on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde receives, accepts, he is also a great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="45">Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been in the last six years of violent crime affected, and the new President has promised during his term of office, especially around this Problem to worry about.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">"I hope that as President he is, how he was Governor," said the PRI Congressman Olvera, in the Valle del Bravo.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">My Mexican-American identity crisis.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Many people are due to the lack of opportunities forced to leave Mexico</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Mexicans tend to be immigrants to blame - you call them hard times in the memory, he says</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Navarrette is of the view that Mexican Americans caught between two worlds are</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On a recent trip to Mexico city I had only just crossed the hall and went to the passport check arrived, as perplexity at me wide-made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of what I should go.</seg>
<seg id="8">I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up and became my whole life, "Mexicans".</seg>
<seg id="9">An ethnic abbreviation, just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians".</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, I decided to "Mexican-American".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But this was Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="12">And in the home of my grandfather's, there was no need for abbreviations, or hyphens.</seg>
<seg id="13">I was just Americans.</seg>
<seg id="14">I speak Spanish, at least well enough to keep me in this language at both Ends of an interview to claim.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent, I will also not let go.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">I thought about that Moment of this week, as the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto the White house visited with President Obama to meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">On the Agenda were all those topics that you would expect, when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and Commerce.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Pena Nieto was also very interested in the growth of the Mexican economy to speak of. It is one of the reasons that Mexicans today with the same high level of probability in Mexico to stay, rather than emigrate to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">He would like to engage with the United States and Canada ally and a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Pena Nieto vowed to take the war against Mexico, the drug cartels continue, even if he has no details to be called.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Most Americans are wasting probably never be a single thought to the fact that the United States in 1848 in Mexico for the pictures and the leadership of the country under the force of the gun to compel them more than half of its territory to leave.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for Mexicans, in centuries, and not in minutes think, are the memories of this event is not to be overlooked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">So, as soon as a U.S. government official also only mildest criticism of Mexico exercises, you can hear it in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country's complaints about how the Americans, the sovereignty of their neighbouring country beset.</seg>
<seg id="26">And the children of Montezuma's go on the warpath.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico, in truth, in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lust, resentment to speak?</seg>
<seg id="29">There are more than enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the country offers a lot of chances, and others, for which it does not do this.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio life, is that at one point in our family tree a Person - maybe a parent or grandparent - no Chance in Mexico offered and got in the direction of the North emigrated.</seg>
<seg id="32">And in most cases, this Person is a profile dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">We are the descendants of these people, and our Loyalty is to you.</seg>
<seg id="34">Not Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="35">And although, perhaps, we now live the American dream, good schools and good Jobs have received, we must never lose sight of it the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our identity is sometimes may blurry, but what about our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="37">This is clearly the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">In addition, we are aware that we have many members of the Mexican ruling class not like.</seg>
<seg id="39">This is based on reciprocity.</seg>
<seg id="40">They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.</seg>
<seg id="41">Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="42">In your opinion, is our existence is a Symbol of failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">If our families are not in Mexico failed, they would not have gone.</seg>
<seg id="44">And then we would not now behind the Seidenvorhang trapped see - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">My wife, in Guadalajara and was born as a child legally in the United States, immigrated, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions, because Mexicans have a clearer idea on who you are, and Mexican Americans take them this evil.</seg>
<seg id="46">While U.S. citizen, it sees itself as part of the two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">However, many Mexican Americans that I know of have the feeling that neither the one nor the other country.</seg>
<seg id="48">We love the Mexican Band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.</seg>
<seg id="49">You can enjoy the Best of both worlds, but in none of them rooted.</seg>
<seg id="50">In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans.</seg>
<seg id="51">And in the United States, we Mexicans seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">As I have during my journey to learn, there's something that this relationship is even more complex: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the Bildungsbürgertums want your Connections to the Diaspora.</seg>
<seg id="53">You want to Mexican Americans than temporary "Ambassador" for Mexico, its interests in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="54">We want our American colleagues tell about how great a visit to this country and to put pressure on the political leadership to exercise their ties to Mexico to intensify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">Now.</seg>
<seg id="56">That will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="57">Too many hurt feelings.</seg>
<seg id="58">And given the unjust distribution of income, the rampant corruption and the Drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.</seg>
<seg id="59">I'm afraid, because you have to go through this alone, Amigos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">This is fair.</seg>
<seg id="61">If at least some of the Mexicans are not ready yet, the United States for dealing with Mexico, one and a half centuries to forgive, you must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for that cherish, such as their family members until not so long ago were treated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Hmmm.</seg>
<seg id="63">Perhaps we are "Mexican", as I thought.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old battles, new middle East</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be as unexpected cornerstone for peace prove</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="4">The recent bloody events seem to have such a hope to nip in the Bud.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the midst of the usual finger-pointing, numerous buildings reduced to rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first Time of rockets from Gaza, near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy city of Jerusalem taken.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, even though the Israelis and the Palestinians in their historical conflict caught seem, is changing the middle East around you.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Arab spring has a new, uncertain Situation created, and whether you want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="8">Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate finally come to an end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">A war that neither lost nor won</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">At first glance it seems to optimism in the face of the current location is everything other than appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if the on 21. November agreed cease-fire stops, the week's fighting, the Hardened on both sides strengthened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The leader of the Hamas, the Islamist movement that since 2007, the Gaza strip, controlled by, say, the Israelis pushed back, although its grouping of large losses recorded had.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although several Hamas leader killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza strip in one of the desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet cooped up, it is Israel until now did not manage to destroy Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Actually wins the Hamas in the West Bank to that of the rival, the moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah controlled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">And the Hamas leaders could arrive at the conclusion that the time is on your side.</seg>
<seg id="17">So, as Islamists in the Arab world are gaining influence, the Hamas powerful and rich friends on their side.</seg>
<seg id="18">Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional Power, once considered one of Israel's closest Muslim ally was, for the Hamas party taken - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic States of the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic Crescent forms - from Lebanon in the North, where the militant group Hezbollah has the Power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren embossing before the Stürzung Bashar Assad could stand up to Jordan, where Hamas-allied to the king threaten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim brotherhood, under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - which is by far the most populous and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has the balance of the Region changed in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hosni Mubarak, the secular Despot, Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years reigned, had only a little time for Hamas left.</seg>
<seg id="22">In contrast to this, the brotherhood with Hamas to any of their leader more of Volksansichten dependent.</seg>
<seg id="23">In future diplomatic negotiations could Hamas as an actor prove itself from Israel and the United States is not expelled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Israeli hard-liners, on the other hand, an opposite conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="25">Militarily speaking, the Hamas is no longer a threat.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Israeli anti-missile defense system, "Iron Dome", prove themselves, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="27">At least for a while Israel is a peaceful sleep.</seg>
<seg id="28">In diplomatic ways, the United States is holding steadfast to their Position. Many European countries have the Hamas for the latest escalation of violence; instead held responsible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Israel, it is in recent years fared well, in particular, under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, of the peace process, in large part ignored.</seg>
<seg id="30">Though the rockets from the Gaza strip since 2004 about 30 Israelis have been killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers stayed - not least thanks to the barriers in the West Bank and in the body of an eventual Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements, for contravention of international law were explained, however, always to be further developed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party in the run-up to the elections on 22. January under Avigdor Lieberman, with a still kämpferischeren group allied.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why this deceitful Palestinians coddle them and give them a state of their own forces?</seg>
<seg id="33">If you are actually in control of the West Bank, you would then not exactly like their counterparts in the Gaza strip also firing missiles?</seg>
<seg id="34">No, it is better for you behind the wall to hold at Bay and to punish, you should dare, the heads up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Maybe the hard-liners can enforce. But the Arab spring could give you a stroke by the bill.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even if the Islamists, who is now in Egypt and in other countries of the Power seats, little for Israel left, first on the difficulties in their own country focus.</seg>
<seg id="37">The defense budget of Israel is greater than its four Arab neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="38">A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments are hardly in the repair of your business to help.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pragmatic President Mursi with Barack Obama teamed to a cease-fire to reach, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new Era symbolize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Also, Israelis should long-term thinking.</seg>
<seg id="41">While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratization taking, Palestinians continue their right of national self-stripped - a powder keg, which is no doubt one day in the Israeli-occupied territories to explode, just as this week, a Bus in Tel Aviv exploded.</seg>
<seg id="42">The suppression undermines already now the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this Situation will only worsen.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bloody missions to defeat Hamas in the Gaza strip over the years increasingly their diplomatic toll.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">Both sides need a push from the outside</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The correct answer is that, of the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper is represented: Two States, in which Israel to enhance security areas to resign.</seg>
<seg id="46">For the near future is small hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence to the enforcement of this solution is given.</seg>
<seg id="47">Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar, the supply of weapons into the Gaza strip to stop and is better positioned than ever before to the Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.</seg>
<seg id="48">Outsiders Arab Nations should also Hamas and Fatah to an agreement to move.</seg>
<seg id="49">This would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the upcoming request for UN observer status.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Obama must do its part to contribute to Israel to negotiate to move.</seg>
<seg id="51">During his first term, he failed the presentation of his own peace plan.</seg>
<seg id="52">Far away in the white house, it seems as if he is just a participation averse.</seg>
<seg id="53">But, this is unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.</seg>
<seg id="54">The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>

<seg id="1">Australian law for uniform cigarette packaging shall enter into force</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs for all tobacco brands are the same</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The world's first laws for uniform cigarettes and Tabakverpackungen in Australia are in force. This brand logos and colors by neutral, olive lid replaced in addition, with dramatic images are printed, which diseased parts of the body, and by cigarette smoke ill infants and children show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Of the different health warnings and images, set apart, is starting this Saturday, the only difference between the packs in the brand name, which is identical, small letters are printed.</seg>
<seg id="5">So does Australia, the world's strictest regulations for Tabakverpackungen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The Australian Federal government wants to young people from Smoking stop by the glamorous image of tobacco use is eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Here, the government of studies that have shown that people with 26 has not started to smoke, with 99%probability, then no more will begin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"You can already among children of young age, to see that they understand the message, the tobacco companies with their brand image, to promote try", said health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies, for example, have shown that children are the crown of a logo with the idea of a Princess associate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Although Australia is one of the lowest Smoking rates continue in the world and the Changes only slightly on the profits of multinational corporations will have an impact, consider other countries already have similar steps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Tabaklobby fought hard against the laws.</seg>
<seg id="11">So it was with the laws would Schwarzmarkthandel favors what to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes do.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The laws are to serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chinese and Indonesian forgers will be much greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia to offer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Others, however, say that the laws of your business boost.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and Silikondeckeln to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, two months ago, at the top Australian court with their challenge to the laws failed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Zico have up to 6,000 units in Großhandelsgeschäfte sold and waiting for new stocks.</seg>
<seg id="17">For us, this is a good deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">According to experts, is the hook in the popularity of social media with just the section of the population, to which the Plan addresses.</seg>
<seg id="19">A number of Australian laws tobacco companies from the TV advertising is banned, you are prohibited, as Sportsponsoren act and the most dealers are forced cigarettes in shops will no longer be interpreted. Now is the tobacco advertising in the Internet changed.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Australian government has Internet advertising by local companies and pages prohibited, but has no influence on the international pages.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Who tobacco markets, and only a small area left has to make its products to apply to the Internet is not around," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On social media sites like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook has Freeman, an increase in reports to trademarks identified by "normal people" were written.</seg>
<seg id="23">One must ask the question: Is this just a private individual, the so great pleasure in Marlboro-cigarettes finds that even a Video - or has a Marketing Agency to do so?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than on Marketing focus, with the new laws to deal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">She's even gone so far as to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay to the new rules challenge - those countries complain to the world trade organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries-major trade with Australia operates.</seg>
<seg id="26">A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Plibersek, according to the government talks with other countries, the similar Verpackungsgesetze consider.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Canada in 2001 was the first country, the photographic warnings prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now these were more than 40 countries expanded, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tougher laws in the UK, new Zealand, South Africa, and India is being considered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Many Australian smokers show up defiantly.</seg>
<seg id="32">The images are not influenced me.</seg>
<seg id="33">I simply ignore them.</seg>
<seg id="34">"It simply takes a Butt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes, a photo with a Mundtumor is printed.</seg>
<seg id="35">To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.</seg>
</p>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In an ever-electrified the world, it is nice sometimes to be bored</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This Thanksgiving, I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems that failed and we are on a different plane had to wait.</seg>
<seg id="3">So I had enough time to get me a couple of thoughts about boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">I don't want to lie.</seg>
<seg id="5">A half-day at the airport on a flight to wait, is pretty annoying, even if the books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free Shopping) are available.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But more and more academics and Kindesentwicklungsexperten lead to boredom as something Positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">If it is after you, it is for us and our children - okay, occasionally get bored.</seg>
<seg id="8">So the brain is forced to engage in interesting thoughts to lose, potentially resulting in the creativity.</seg>
<seg id="9">And because most of us nowadays almost all the time on one or the other screen rigid, come to us the advantages of the boredom of not more benefit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We should boredom so with open arms to welcome?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="12">And no.</seg>
<seg id="13">I'll be back again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, the increasing leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="15">But Peter Toohey, a Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) that it is not seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"In fact, the boredom of a very long story," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">The walls of Pompey is decorated with a Latin Graffiti, boredom, to the first century back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And then there is the question of how we boredom actually define.</seg>
<seg id="19">John D. Eastwood, an associate Professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, according to the Problem consists in the fact that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">After a long reading of literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people came Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, "a satisfactory activity to want, but not to be able to" define.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Boredom is different from apathy, consequently, to the effect that the Person is not employed but would like to be.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The key lesson of boredom, he says, is a "disorder of the Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that the time slowly passes by".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Boredom can almost sound like Depression.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two States could relate to, to see the bored people the Problem in your environment or the world, while those who are depressed the Problem in see themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Sometimes, we believe that us is boring, even if we only have difficulties to concentrate.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", in English: "The idle mind: The Definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science" was published, assign Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on a previous Experiment, the participants a Band to listen to, to which a Person is a Magazinartikel read.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room, nothing to do with the content had to do. Others heard it on low volume, so it is hardly noticeable, while the third group this sounds at all not heard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The people, the hardly audible television heard, said, more boredom than the other two groups to feel - you had problems, focus, and could for no reason, and wrote their difficulties of boredom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If you try to be a difficult or strenuous task focus, the disorder of attention lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate Professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">If you are a monotonous activity "as the search for faulty products on a Fabrikförderband, music can distract your attention and help, not to be bored to feel".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In fact, he says, we now know that flounders about and Scribbling, often as a sign of boredom interpreted, even to fight against by persons physically attentive to stay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln may, to learn more and more to retain information than those for sitting still be forced," said Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">All of us will eventually get bored of my delayed flight, a boomed speaker, a particularly tedious Film.</seg>
<seg id="35">But some people get bored more easily than others.</seg>
<seg id="36">These differences to measure, developed by researchers in the 1980s, a "scale Langeweileanfälligkeit".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">On the scale, in statements such as "Lots of things I need to do repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Using such scales, researchers have found that boys more often boring than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, what is the need for more and a wider variety of external stimuli.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">But, in General, Teenagers are a pretty abgespannter pile.</seg>
<seg id="40">In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an Experiment in which he almost 400 Teenagers and their parents seven to eight Times a day with a Pager contacted.</seg>
<seg id="41">He found out that 32% of the Adolescents in school and when you Do the homework were bored, while 23% said bored to be, if you were not at school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">However, only 3% of the parents stated that bored to feel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages regarding the boredom has risen or fallen.</seg>
<seg id="44">He was sure, however, that "the youth as a particularly boring perceived", mainly because of the children and Teenagers not have much influence on their Alltagsablauf.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">So back to my original question is: Is boredom healthy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to extreme physical risks to take and the gambling or drugs expire, in order to alleviate studies have shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">On the other hand, examine many philosophers and writers of the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich on the subject for more than two decades researching.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">"With the boredom wants the brain will tell you that you have something else to do," said Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at the University of New York.</seg>
<seg id="49">But the brain doesn't always know what you do best.</seg>
<seg id="50">When bored, and this energy is used to playing the guitar and cooking, you will be happy.</seg>
<seg id="51">But television can in the short-term for happiness, worry, this evaporate, but in the long again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Who his bored child, so an iPad enough, it can thus be bored dissuade. It has not, however, learned how to entertain yourself or control, says Professor Fenske.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one Situation to the other."</seg>
<seg id="54">The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas, more self-control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">I don't think we boredom celebrate.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also, we should not be too critical.</seg>
<seg id="57">Instead, it should be our aim, and we are off to the constant activity and Technologieberieselung feel at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Professor Eastwood agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">"It sounds as if we are frequently to be boring. But boredom is the nagging, unceasing desire to do something Useful," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">He believes that the people of truth only looking for a way to switch off and relax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">"In an environment In which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to be engaged, if the noise once silenced."</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">In Colorado, there are no clear guideline for the new Marihuanagesetz</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The 19-year-old Community College Student and a footballer Anthony Orozco is in the South-East of Colorado for an Offence before a court in this state will soon be legal: The possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a whistle, he smoked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Orozco, according to he and some friends at a Septembertag with the car in Lamar near the border of Kansas on the road, when they were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the police officers marijuana in the car had found, was Orozco for the possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia pre - peccadilloes, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars are provided and received a court date.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"We are treated as Criminals", so Orozco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">But he is also one?</seg>
<seg id="7">In the uncertain weeks after the conclusion of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use to legalize the answer depends, in hundreds of minor drug offences less from the law, as the location.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Hundreds of offences and to marijuana turn, here and in the state of Washington, the similar measures are approved, has already dropped.</seg>
<seg id="9">The police keep track of adults over 21 years of age, no longer for possession of small dimensions. This is permitted by law, as soon as the new laws in the next few weeks to enter into force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced existing Marihuanadelikte pursue quote still people in court.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, voices of several cities, from the suburbs of Denver's up to the Western Mountains to the new, state-licensed Marihuanageschäfte at the opening in their communities to prevent it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">"This Situation is evolving so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, East of Denver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">And regulators in the state of Washington scratching at a loss on the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licence system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a period to 1. December 2013 eyes.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Washington, it is felt that Colorado is in any case the majority of the States in advance, what the regulation of marijuana. There was the drug only for medical purposes and then to the personal use of legalized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore good for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Inspectorate for spirits in the state of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Smith also that there is no place or System can do more, as in the sense of a rough guide to serve.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have no real precedent, and we can follow," he adds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The Washington law, called I-502, occurs at the 6. December in force, and as such is also the end point of a grey area, in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the ownership was legalized.</seg>
<seg id="20">And unpleasant Praxisfragen need at this time to be clarified, for example, such as the state requirement of a "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of Cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 meters to schools, Parks, playgrounds, childcare facilities to be agreed upon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Nowhere is it harder to be a site for a licensed Cannabisgeschäft to find than in urban areas, especially in the Metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">On 21. November sent Chief Oates its employees in Aurora an E-Mail, in which he stated that the public Prosecutor would be smaller Marihuanadelikte for persons over 21 years of age no longer pursue, and that the police "from now on" no criminal charges for these Offenses aspire to become.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban standards for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana would prevail and drug traffickers continue to pursue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In Weld County in the North of Colorado represents district attorney Ken Buck a stricter view.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the vote, he gave his authority would cases of Marihuanabesitz continue to pursue, mainly to consumers for the withdrawal to move.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently have to 119 persons for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana to answer before court, although many also for other offences were charged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">"Our authority has the duty to violations to keep track of which were carrying to the offences concerned", let Buck in a statement announced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters of the marijuana Initiative refused, ambivalent.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults for the possession of smaller amounts of not longer.</seg>
<seg id="30">District attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided, however, not all of the outstanding Besitzverfahren to drop.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">"I don't think that I have time to waste, enforce the law, until it changes," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Although 55% of the voters in Colorado, the measure is supported, was, from the outset, clearly, that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of the government and the legal system to agree.</seg>
<seg id="33">And the contradictory reactions in the entire state promoted among local officials a deep dichotomy in terms of the big green Experiment-a-days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">In Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it were a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for Marihuanadelikte before the court standing accused represents and on the spot, as a spokesman for the national organization for the Reform of Marihuanagesetzen acts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">"You have such a large part of your life is spent, people are prosecuted, that the legalization still can't accept", he believes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As the first States, which have smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol treat, Colorado, and Washington as a national Musterfälle for the legalization of drugs traded.</seg>
<seg id="37">While advocates and government officials to an era legal sale prepare wait for you at the same time also nervous on the instructions of the Federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the Federal level will continue as a criminal Offence wants to treat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Advocates of the Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the Ministry of justice to yield.</seg>
<seg id="39">Despite several controversial arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States for the most part, is permitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Kevin A. Sabet, former policy adviser to the Obama government is of the view that detectives although probably no doors, to smaller amounts, the seizure of drugs, but probably Balk, under the new legislation, legal, state-regulated marijuana shops to tolerate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Several cities in Colorado wait not even sure that the Federal authorities to act.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even before the election day approved some local government authorities moratoriums on new medical marijuana shops, although these only in about a year could open.</seg>
<seg id="43">Last week decided to Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, probably next week will be adopted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">"We don't want to be in a Position advised, when we have someone license, and then at the Federal level is a big issue," said Bob Nicholson, member of the city Council.</seg>
<seg id="45">Our community is against this amendment voted.</seg>
<seg id="46">We align ourselves with what the community has decided, for which the state has decided.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Petronella Wyatt: I was in Oxford, bullied, because I Tory am</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only University students of today will be for your views attacked</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">It was always been my biggest dream, a place at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both my father and my older brother had those at University, I was once the largest Wissenstempel the world stopped for a modern Greek Symposium, the major pillars of the civilization - free Thinking and tolerance promoted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">However, within two weeks after my move-in Worscester College at the end of the eighties - it was there that I was going to study history, I had regained my suitcases is Packed, and so the first scandal of my life brought about.</seg>
<seg id="6">My father burst into tears.</seg>
<seg id="7">My friends were confused.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the Evening Standard said it, I would have gone, because I have a Problem with that would have had that fellow students in the neighbouring room had Sex.</seg>
<seg id="9">The author of A N Wilson said mischievously, I would have left the University, because I was forced, from a damaged cups to drink.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The truth, however, was less amusing.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.</seg>
<seg id="13">Not because of my unusual Name, or because I'm from a private school had come.</seg>
<seg id="14">You had me for only one reason-harassment - a reason that in this alleged cradle of enlightenment to be so closed-minded and cruel seemed to: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important Advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supporter of the Conservative party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Why do I mention this just now?</seg>
<seg id="16">Now, the current reportedly suffers from a new Generation of students of the moderate Right under similar persecution.</seg>
<seg id="17">The organized and increasing hatred on Tory students in Oxford now has such dimensions developed, that a group of them last week, the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz demanded, the Homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities to benefit from.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are, because of their political views, "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable".</seg>
<seg id="19">You are claiming a place in the Gleichberechtigungskomitee your College, to ensure that their opinions freely expressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Has been aggravated their Situation by a recently broadcast documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright, and on the Right", the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.</seg>
<seg id="21">In it was shown, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the conservative student Association of the University of Oxford, in a Rolls-Royce and drove with silver suit and silberbesetztem walking stick for showing off.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">At other universities say conservative students, they are called "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".</seg>
<seg id="23">The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the conservative student Union of the University of Nottingham, was in a Sunday paper said: "There is a growing Linkstendenz at universities.</seg>
<seg id="24">The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us ever to have met".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Samuel Roberts, 21 and a student of history, in Corpus Christi, of the request for greater protection initiated, is of the view that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated President of the conservative students ' Union of Oxford says, you have JCR members of a growing rejection of students of the moderate Right is observed.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members," she says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.</seg>
<seg id="28">As incredibly shy 18-Year-old was I in September 1986 arrived.</seg>
<seg id="29">The hatred on the Conservative party had reached its peak.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the previous year, the University had voted in favour of it, Margaret Thatcher, a former graduate student because of cuts in higher education no honorary title loan.</seg>
<seg id="31">The atmosphere would have been even Stalinists can scare.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In the first days of fresher's week, when the new students and the Tutors to get to know, I got a taste of the future events.</seg>
<seg id="33">I made the experience, that the Tutors, the mockery of the Tory students not only tolerated, but even with joy participated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Political issues such as the Bergarbeiterstreik, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the Apartheid Regime in South Africa found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="35">On my first of these events, I should, French texts from the 18. Century to translate to English. On what then should come, I was not taken to have been.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">"Miss Wyatt," said the Tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "to translate, please, the first paragraph".</seg>
<seg id="37">I stumbled across this.</seg>
<seg id="38">Pitt was a small man, with a face from the cake batter, and pretty spiteful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">"Refuse Thatcher followers to learn French, or are you just stupid?", he asked me.</seg>
<seg id="40">The other students giggled.</seg>
<seg id="41">In my eyes wallten tears.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I suggest that you in your leisure time, a couple of French lessons take - so, when they are not with their social activities are busy"growled me Pitt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">I returned with his head hanging in my room.</seg>
<seg id="44">This evening I sat in the College alone at dinner, when someone lightly on the shoulder and typed in.</seg>
<seg id="45">It was a Englischstudent from the second year of the name of James, a member of the conservative student Association presented.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I know who you are," he said kindly.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unfortunately, it is as it is.</seg>
<seg id="48">Anyone who is suspected of Tory to be harassed.</seg>
<seg id="49">For me it is bad enough, but you know that your father Margaret Thatcher close, so is it for you to be worse.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the Tory-freshmen give, supporters of the Labour party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In a local Pub, I tried later, me to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="52">I insisted that I do not in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher an opinion was.</seg>
<seg id="53">This Trick should not prove to be successful.</seg>
<seg id="54">A first-year students in philosophy, politics and Economics, which, ironically, as a conservative applicable Eton College had visited, said to me: "You are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins".</seg>
<seg id="55">You're dirty.</seg>
<seg id="56">Other students shared his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="57">I was kinky and dirty.</seg>
<seg id="58">"How Tories have Sex?", asked me one.</seg>
<seg id="59">The beat each other, or?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">I felt myself as a homosexual in front of the more liberal legislation of the United States must have felt.</seg>
<seg id="61">Would I ever succeed at the University of Oxford to lead a normal life?</seg>
<seg id="62">I would like-Minded people only after dark?</seg>
<seg id="63">Should I of the Labour party to turn to, and my natural inclinations must repress?</seg>
<seg id="64">The three years in front of me were expanded before my mind's eye to a purgatory of Ostracism and Isolation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The only Tutor, who is openly as Tory to recognize, was Norman Stone, Professor of contemporary history, which has its seat in my College had.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was not only hated, a Conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy advice and for you to Talk to had written.</seg>
<seg id="67">He was rarely there.</seg>
<seg id="68">He hated the place, found him provincial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic Geschichtsperspektive.</seg>
<seg id="69">in 1997, he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara in Turkey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">"You're not happy here," he said to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">I began, between Oxford and my parents ' house to commute and found refuge with supportive friends and family members in the city.</seg>
<seg id="72">My father told me that I Oxford hated, and why I did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">He seemed incredulous.</seg>
<seg id="74">During his time in the forties were all political views are accepted.</seg>
<seg id="75">"But it is the best place in the world," he said meekly.</seg>
<seg id="76">Something you would never do, not in my city of dreaming spires.</seg>
<seg id="77">Even my Communist friends put always impeccable manners of the day.</seg>
<seg id="78">His moist eyes clouded.</seg>
<seg id="79">Give it a Chance.</seg>
<seg id="80">I'm sure you teases you.</seg>
<seg id="81">It would break my heart when you went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.</seg>
<seg id="83">One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had the pressure caved in, and his Convictions to renounce.</seg>
<seg id="84">During a seminar the following week, with a further Geschichtstutor seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="85">Although I secretly shame zerging, I admitted that my parents have a "brainwashing" were tested, and called it "old fool".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">The relief lasted only briefly.</seg>
<seg id="87">It was my father who is the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford-career suggested.</seg>
<seg id="88">At that time he wrote per week, two columns in the Murdoch press.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">My door was locked.</seg>
<seg id="90">I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave my pursuers.</seg>
<seg id="91">As they went, I Packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.</seg>
<seg id="92">I never returned.</seg>

<seg id="13">Possible that many of these ideas were creative, they led, but not necessarily to success.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, we thought: Why don't we make something as creative as possible in order to address this Problem, as such. As a Rap to compose?</seg>

<seg id="40">This means that for our Cash Flow much better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">He is, however, that the new standards developers clearer guidance, which previously obstacles put in the way, if you have too many small units in a project to build.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Too much Stress</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Singapore is a city-state.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was the examination results confirmed: HIV-positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the Moment in which he is the diagnosis is received, the doctor without noticeable success "mitigate tried".</seg>
<seg id="4">He hid it in front of his family.</seg>
<seg id="5">He decided alone to his illness to take care of and started to inform about it; and this, with such use, that he was in his 43. Birthday celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he after several Fights in 1994.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 90s was hard to imagine, as there are many doubt, a few treatment options, and more Stigmata were.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time, avoided even the Director of a clinic of the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it's a dead end."</seg>
<seg id="9">At that time AIDS was synonymous with death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Today, it is possible that this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, still many people in the hospital, none of their disease knowledge, and where the Virus is already harm and your immune system is exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">31 years after the Appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e., after the Occurrence of the first reported cases, "means the great success it is today, that the Survival of a patient, the treatment takes time, and the Survival of the General population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that this Information is in April of this year from a reputable scientific publication have been supported.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the year 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the year of Survival and the quality of life of the degree of impairment of the immune system of the persons at the beginning of the treatment stake, and that the greater the chance they have not drug addicts: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Simply put, the meaning of the above, that, who at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of being HIV-positive, in this sense, "easily 75 years old can be, as long as he is under control," said this professional.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">To this progress classified correctly, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today, an average of 76 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Even if the mortality rate in the past few years, significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in the year 2011 (the annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), it is nevertheless true that since the advent of the AIDS 60 percent of the national database collected patients have died.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alone in the state of Jalisco died in the year 2011 255 people, and until the month of may of this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured, that since 2005 universal access to the antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">- Why die so still people in it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">- In my opinion, is not the Problem of access to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.</seg>
<seg id="21">At least in the past 12 years, we have had no supply problems with drugs. The Problem is, that the people in far advanced state to come, because your Infektionszustand not know, i.e. in the very late stages of the disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an accompanying infection. To the global mortality influence, are to earlier diagnoses required, which is why all persons, where this is required, massive detection tests, must be provided."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">This proposal agree with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state Committee for AIDS prevention in the state of Jalisco), and also the patients as Fabrizio to its Test at a private laboratory to perform for him, and this for the simple reason, because it is a friend of him had made, in spite of his young age already in the AIDS Phase was, and even the Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous Tumor) had, which is one of the usual complications.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Everything is different when you know that you AIDS have.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some think that they are going to die, and want to hear nothing.</seg>
<seg id="26">"If I must die, rather then three Times burst", as you say in my case.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Change was to towards improvement, I eat well, exercise, and take the medicines.</seg>
<seg id="28">Today, to know his parents, that he had cancer.</seg>
<seg id="29">I live a normal life, like any other.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I work, I do a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the health of the other Person", is one of Fabrizio, which agreed to its intimate Details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony those to animate, today, in the framework of the world AIDS day to be afraid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You should do the Test, if you are in the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV-positive are, the better, and if the diagnosis already know, you should learn how to be like all the people responsible life.</seg>
<seg id="32">His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Condoms behind the counter</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Between the programmes and the simple citizen, there are large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, a Journalist from Guadalajara, the matter of HIV has been accepted.</seg>
<seg id="35">And the most Important is the prevention.</seg>
<seg id="36">At the certain places "was the distribution of condoms actually increased; previously they were individually released, now give us packages with one hundred pieces, what is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.</seg>
<seg id="37">To the people at risk for new infections include the young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">"Why do you need it?" is a common Spottfrage of social workers, Orientierungspersonal in schools, employees in pharmacies and the health care system, the young people do not want to be exposed to, assured the correspondent.</seg>
<seg id="39">He suggested this inefficient distribution to re-Orient; the condoms should not only behind the counter, but rather in output devices in a public toilet facilities, which are often of young people to be visited.</seg>
<seg id="40">It should not encourage promiscuity.</seg>
<seg id="41">It should not give them the beer and Motel be paid, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez on the question and replied, whether under his administration condoms will be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Sexuality looks not so; it is Best that condoms those to bring them closer to that already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Key data of the Jalisco</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There are 13,435 thousand cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).</seg>

<seg id="1">Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Globetrotter of basketball, Hector "Hetin" Reyes was the Korbsport for more than 60 years and has traveled all over the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Before it by a stroke in 2008, wheelchair bound, was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, whether it be as a player with the lower classes, players of the first national League, a representative and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketballverbands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"Throughout my life I have me in Basketball many hats set up, even several at the same time, as I am President of the BSN, chief Executive of the national team and President of the Association in the 90s was," recalled Reyes, during a visit by Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he is with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years, resides.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Basketball was my life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Reyes exaggerates with this statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The walls of his house are almost all photos and memories of his long career decorated and testify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Bayamón in the heart</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The most emotional memories are those who believe in his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as a player until 1982 remember where he has his 15-year anniversary as co-managing Director or managing Director of the club was celebrated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"Those were the best years of my, I most enjoyed, because I'm part of eight Championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, it was as managing Director, co-managing Director or Trainer to be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were a lot of fulfilling years, including five Championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="13">And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut album by Jerome Mincy BSN.</seg>
<seg id="14">From then took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who is a very good Manager was," says Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">I still do that to me genes Bartow, as a Trainer and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was employed, said: "I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.</seg>
<seg id="16">Do You want him?"</seg>
<seg id="17">And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico ever had.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bartow recommended after the Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, naturalised and let one of our best pitcher was.</seg>
<seg id="19">I remember how he said that, if Mincy a championship for Bayamon allows had Gausse for a more would be taken care of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance out, because in 1988 he already at the top of the Union state.</seg>
<seg id="21">At this time he moved it in front of, its enforcement, and the Mincy in the national team to enjoy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I remember, when we for the first Time when vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States won.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then came the world Cup in 1990, when the fourth place is occupied, what actually Bronze would have meant to be, if not this canadian referee would have been in the us for the last turn, for the second Time to repeat left, said Reyes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">This group was the world Cup in 1990, the best national team, which you've ever seen?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is one of the Best, as well as those at the 2004 Olympics against the " Dream Team", won.</seg>
<seg id="26">My favorite is the team of the pan-American games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won Gold and the Team of the USA a fight offered, as at that time, as you may have against us in the world Cup Bronze won.</seg>
<seg id="27">In that team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, the 1990 due to a knee injury, could not be there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A team, perhaps in terms of personalities was not the Best, but we won a gold medal and the us great joy, those of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="29">With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events on the pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won contrary to forecast the gold medal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">This was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.</seg>
<seg id="32">His Numbers on the level of the international tournaments are impressive.</seg>
<seg id="33">No one in Puerto Rico on this level as dominant as Piculín.</seg>
<seg id="34">And this, without his career in the different leagues to take into account, in which he has played.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Who was the best trainers from Puerto Rico?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">This is a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="37">We had a couple of good Trainer, such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">What do you think is the Best thing you in the Federation have reached?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">I was part of the most successful Era, the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in a season included.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">What remains for you to do?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">There are things I would have introduced such. Example, the regionalisation of the lower categories.</seg>
<seg id="43">The guys in Ponce z. B. only in their field of play and only in the national Playoffs to the teams from different corners of the island meet.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today, the children have many unnecessary travel and games.</seg>
<seg id="45">At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.</seg>
<seg id="46">I'm proud of that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">What are You doing today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">I love to listen to music, see Videos from the music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.</seg>
<seg id="49">And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who is always at my side.</seg>
