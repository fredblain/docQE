Old engagements, the new Near East
The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could prove as unexpected cornerstones for the peace
Can there ever be continuous peace between Arabs and Jews in the Near East?
The newest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual accusations countless buildings were put in debris and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of it civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza are hit in the proximity of the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem imprisoned in their historical conflict, the Near East changes around it.
Arab spring created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or non Palestinians and Israelis is part of these confusions become.
Perhaps this will lead only to more bloodsheds.
But there are reasons to the acceptance that the deadly deadlock could find finally their end.
A war, which is lost nor won neither
At first sight optimism seems in view of the current situation everything else as appropriate.
Even if on 21 November the agreed upon armistice continues, this-week fights the hardsimmered on both sides strengthened.
The leaders of the Hamas, which Islamist movement, which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, from itself to state the Israelis to have pushed back although its grouping had to register large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitant of the Gaza Strip in one the desolatest and closely populating Estonian corners of the planet are crammed in, Israel did not succeed in up to now destroying the Hamas.
The Hamas in the West Jordan territory actually gains, which is controlled by the rivaling, moderate Palestinian group of Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come in the end that they have the time on their side.
Thus, as Islamists in the Arab world at influence won, the Hamas could pull powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, one like-those-strong-ends, regional power, which was considered once as of Israel of closest Muslim allying, for Hamas Partei seized - exactly like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that around Israel an Islamist half-moon forms - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly more Islamist coinage before falling Bashar Assads could stand up to Jordan, where Hamas allying threatens the king.
And in particular the ascent of the Muslim Brotherhood under president Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - which with distance inhabitant-strongest and most important Arab country - at the southern flank of Israel the balance of the region changed effectively.
Hosni Mubarak, the laicist despot, which governed Egypt up to its fall 2011 30 years long, had only little time for the Hamas remaining.
In contrast to it those depends more strongly on people opinions brother shank with the Hamas related by marriage and their leaders.
With future diplomatic negotiations the Hamas could prove as a participant, who cannot be out-pushed even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners however let an opposite conclusion pull.
Militarily seen the Hamas is no more danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, “Iron of cathedrals”, could themselves work satisfactorily and many of the Hamas rockets was destroyed.
At least one while long will be able to sleep Israel more calmly.
In diplomatic regard the United States hold unshakeably to their position. Many European countries made the Hamas responsible for the newest force escalations.
Israel was issued it in last years well, in particular under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who ignored the peace process to large parts.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country remained relatively free by suicide bombers - not least owing to the check plants, which in-run into the West Jordan territory and thus into the main part of a any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which were explained for contrary to international law, however to be developed always further.
Netanyahu stands well there. Its Likud party allied itself before the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with a still more aggressive group.
Why also do these deceitful Palestinians mollycoddle and them their own state left?
If they had actually control of the West Jordan territory, wouldn't they then fire exactly like their fellow combatants in the Gaza Strip also rockets?
No, it is better to hold and punish it behind the wall in chess, should it dare to lift the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able themselves to implement. But Arab spring could make a line for them by the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who sit now in Egypt and in other countries at power, have few for Israel remaining, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in the own country.
The defense budget of Israel is together larger than its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments during the repair of its economy.
That pragmatic president Mursi with Barack Obama together-did, in order to reach an armistice, perhaps a promiseful indication could be - and symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Also Israelis should think more on a long-term basis.
While the remaining Arab world undertakes timid steps toward democratization, Palestinians are robbed further of their right of self-determination - a powder keg, which one day in the Israeli occupied territories will certainly explode, exactly like this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The suppression undermines already the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will be only intensified.
Bloody missions to the repelling of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand their diplomatic tribute over the years increasingly.
Both sides need an impact from the outside
The correct answer is that one, those by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the remaining world and by this newspaper is represented: Two states, at which Israel retires for security purposes areas.
- For the near future small - hope consists of the fact that the armistice grants outsiders more influence for the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must stop now together with Turkey and Qatar the weapon supplies in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever before, in order to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on basis of the borders of 1967, supplemental by exchange of territory and a common Jerusalem.
Outstanding Arab nations should likewise induce the Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
Thus more would be done for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN-observer status.
Also Obama must contribute its part to move Israel to negotiations.
During its first term of office it missed the conception of its own peace plan.
Remotely in the white house it seems far, as if it would be just as averse from a participation.
But that is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have a substantial interest in stable the Near East.
And in addition a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians belongs.
