“Valentino draws elegance of celebrity forwards”
On the occasion of the exhibition “Valentino - master of the Couture”, which this week in London was opened, speaks ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customer of the Italian mode doer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of the accomodation of an exhibition over Valentino Garavani.
This recognized the designer with the opening of “Valentino - masters of the Couture”, a magnificent retrospective, for which more than 130 dresses of the haute couture were arranged, which were created by its “Maison” in the last 50 years.
“I love this palace”, say he with its unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a history, whose only protagonist “IL is signore” Garavani, which could not have been written however without its distinguished clientele.
Valentino always already felt fascination for the stuffy and far world of the aristocracy.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will have to be seen still by 3 March, there is a variety at private letters and photo with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, begun from the princess Salimah Aga Khan, over the princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England up to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino points these personal memories as trophies of its social ascent of the modest mode doer in the city Voghera in north Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
With the aristocracy falls in love to be, does not have to be not from disadvantage.
“At least they do not withdraw their dumps on your wonderful carpet, like it some beautiful famousnesses from the pop music do”, say baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In and the 70's 60's the two lived in the alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
“We all made us happy, if we were invited into its house into Gstaad”, explain the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, closely friendly with forgotten beauties like e.g. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino always already preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And it is a star nevertheless.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the mode doer.
Many years ago we went to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna into Rome to him home with dinner.
We were approximately 20 persons, among them also Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
By each detail of its apartment, the decoration, by the meal and at the music and felt one recognized its influence.
“All invitations felt importantly and loved”, remember the “Top model”, which began their career at the week of the haute couture 1995 in Paris.
“He never comes from the mode, because its designs of works of art are” say them finally.
Fashion show of the origin
The life of Garavani is not history of obsessedness, rather from mutual affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 meter long gangway, which suggests an exchange of roles: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the gangway, in order to admire a fantastic “audience”, which carries masterpieces of Valentino, as for example the dress, which selected Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes, which Monica Vitti carried in “La Notte”, or a coat from wool and leather, to which belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
In this audience from mode dolls names radiate as from Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the mode doer, 2006
Many of these customers say, which is first Valentino like the first love, “unforgettably”.
I can remember still perfectly.
It was trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat type “Gillette” and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift of it”, says Naty Abascal, one the Musen of the designer.
“I pull it to all different because of its large love for the women and because he emphasizes our beauty, forwards”, the ex-duchess of Feria adds.
I like the colors, which he uses, very much; they have much light and to underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion-prominent with the mode Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time, when she carried a Valentino.
When I lived as teenager in Italy, I dreamed to finally have the age and the opportunity one of its evening gowns to carry…
End of the 90's was added it then finally.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a celebration in the lock of my cousin, the prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped upper section with a decollete, which makes honour for its name.
“It was a truely become dream”, says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino does not depend on the mode, its obsession is timeless”, describes this Italian aristocrat, which lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening gowns of the mode doer “with absolute care”, “because a dress not only a dress is, but also the associated memories”.
The “king” the mode
The large final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for their wedding with Pablo de Grecia in the year 1995.
Four months work and 25 “Ragazze” (like the mode doer called its sewers) were necessary, in order this elfenbeinfarbene silk dress with beads, twelve different embroideries and four and one-half meters are enough for tail to make.
According to the lady journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the technical literature, was this dress a milestone in the haute couture end the 20. Century, “the return to the customers of the highest society”.
For many years with “savoir être” of the elite clouded, is Valentino now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre the kinds et the Lettres, excellently with the Legion of Honour, cumulates to Garavani so many honours, like everyone of the husbands of its customers.
“Always its Raffinement, its peace, its maintained and perfect exterior was noticeable to me”, admits D'Arenberg.
I saw it the last mark one month ago with a gala dinner in the museum de Orsay.
It sat at the table of countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
“It was immaculate; the time does not leave traces at it”.
And this says a princess…
