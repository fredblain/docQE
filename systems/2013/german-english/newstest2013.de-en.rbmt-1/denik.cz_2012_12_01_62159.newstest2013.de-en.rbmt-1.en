Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think of the fact that in less than one month the end of the world is taking place?
That is one of those disaster messages, on which we start humans so gladly.
With our volumes The TAP TAP make we rather about the fact hilariously and say themselves that we are the only volume of the world, which can collect sufficient positive energy, in order to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you in addition a singular project with three concerts realize against the end of the world.
Can you present the project to our readers more near?
This concerns a country-wide benefit meeting, which we plan already two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is prognosticated for 21 December around 11:10 clock in the morning.
On the day before it, i.e. on 20 December, take place starting from 21:00 clock at the same time three of concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is to be in approximately at the time, at which on the Pacific island Kiribati, which lies in a time zone by 12 hours before us, to which Maya calendar ends.
From whom does this idea come?
Originally of me, afterwards we decorated probably the idea common with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
We would like to collect not only sufficiently positive energy, in order to prevent the end of the world, but we would like to think also together with the public about in which condition we transfer this world once to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar we also a singular collection of shoes, T-shirts, and key supporters against the end of the world, developed bags with whose purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people can likewise support us.
The volume The TAP TAP has together with other artists in addition also the so-called hymn against the end of the world with the title “end of the world falls out” taken up.
Already today is the hymn on YouTube much likes. Will it ring out also on the charity concerts?
Of course, completely in the end, provided that everything folds and the end of the world does not take place…
The hymn is to be sung by all artists on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition the hymns become together televised live in a direct circuit of the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, which plays also the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with…
How did you come to co-operation with both?
We cooperate even with further personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is connected with the fact that we realize many benefit meetings and concerts…
We strive to merge these people intensively into our projects.
It has itself shown that most are interested in a co-operation with us, and joke to it to have.
Which purpose do proceeds of the concerts benefit against the end of the world?
For the facility of the barrier-free education center Studeo, on which we work already six years as well as the association TAP in the Jedlička institute.
The pupils of the Jedlička institute are cared for regularly by lectors, who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the pupils themselves do not have the means, in order to visit the lectors, we would like to help them in this way.
In contexts of the completion of the Jedlička institute its own building is to develop, into which we draw then with this project.
With each concert several groups and artist arise.
According to which criteria did you select these?
We wanted to arrange a program, which addresses all generations including children.
In Prague for example China ski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý arises.
You experience all further on the Internet site www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “big events” planned also for the future?
In May we arise for the first time with the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year would like we also gladly in the Czech house in New York to arise, and I personally - if we already in the USA are - would connect this also gladly with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans are not straight small, so far you already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow arose.
The TAP TAP is however a group, which consists of humans with handicaps.
How do you master these journeys logistically and organizational?
It is not so bad, as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the baggage compartment. In addition we must naturally carry along many instrument suit-cases and other luggage…
Nevertheless it folded ČSA and British Airways without problems, was always very well preparatory for us so far always that I was sometimes partly already surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we recently were, there were no problems.
By your foreign travel you have a comparison, how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, as one with handicapped humans go around there etc.
How did you experience these things so far?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and further cities, in which everything works better than with us, we were straight in Russia witnesses its that in the east still everything is in its beginnings.
Opposite Prague Moscow is absolutely not handicapped accessible. There it is still unusual, if someone is in the wheelchair alone in the city centre on the way.
It is not even natural there that one lets in a wheelchair user for example in the elevator.
Fortunately develop also there associations, which try, to refer to the problems of humans with handicaps.
And in which regard we must catch up that opposite far developed countries?
There are still many things, in which we hang afterwards…
In addition it is to be however still marked that an improvement of the situation also always depends on the effort of the concerning.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely usually that also humans with severe disabilities move independently in the public area, into the museum goes, toilets to use can etc.
Is however not straight usual that a larger group of handicapped humans takes part actively there in the social happening, in it are we with the volumes The TAP TAP the west a little ahead!
Respect in the public and accessibility is a thing, but only if from our rows meaning sportsman, artist, actor, politician or attorneys come, the things will really begin to change.
So far these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The TAP TAP is at present very popular. Decrease if we however a few years: What motivated you in the year 1998 to create a volume?
At that time I began as a responsible person in the Jedlička institute, where I met many young people, which were interested to be occupied with somewhat intensive.
And there I musicians am and saxophone play among other things, I together with a colleague an music AG created.
Well, and with the time that, like our moderator, is Láďa Angelovič, to say maintains, somewhat out of control advisablely (laughs).
Became does those admit volume however only in the last years, or errs I?
It is correct that co-operation with well-known singers helped us; in addition we also began to recruit actively for us.
It became conscious to us that, if one carries something out and this outward not to be seen is those does not exist own achievement in certain sense.
Owing to the European Union-aid money we can afford besides good lectors, high-quality devices and etc.
Was it your goal of bringing it with The TAP TAP so far?
From the outset I felt the potential that one can turn on the things differently.
In the show Business today often copies the other one.
That is logical in its way, since all new one with caution is regarded and accepted only after longer time.
There are only few really singular things, and I dare to state that TAP TAP belongs to it.
The first impression, which the spectator has usually, is naturally compassion; that is only natural…
But this compassion is absolutely redundant, because humans with handicaps are not lonely and abandoned natures, which we would have to regret.
There is humans, who can an full life live and develop, if they have the means necessary for it.
I say always that if somewhat succeeds to humans with handicaps, this not only for it a progress am, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, how one of many people hears?
If one liked to make somewhat good, one may a certain discipline in many things no compromises be received and must also call in.
This is in my opinion however completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic conceptions, and if they determine then that they have twice the week sample, preparatory phases to complete must and much time on concert tours spend, then the enthusiasm expires with many fast.
Thus it functions however everywhere, in each volume, which wants to work seriously and reach something.
At present The TAP TAP has twenty members.
How did many of it participate from the outset, i.e. since 1998?
More only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent that.
Who has the will and which is desire at going through, with us always welcome.
