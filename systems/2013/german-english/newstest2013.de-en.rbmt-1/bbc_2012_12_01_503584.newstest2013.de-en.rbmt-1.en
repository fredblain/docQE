Of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto stands before difficult start
While of Mexico prepares future president Enrique Pena Nieto for its assumption of office, Will Grant analyzes forthcoming challenges and the feelings of his people mixed by the BBC it.
Up-to-date traffic is completely particularly bad in Mexico City.
Even on better days this is a always clogged city, but on Monday a ring from steel was established, which closes off several important traffic routes into the capital and on the roads for chaos provides.
The goal was it however not to disturb commuters on the way to the work to prevent but demonstrators from it the parliament to reach.
On Saturday will of Mexico new president Enrique Pena Nieto president-bind to receive and the guidance of the nation to take over.
It stands before a complex task.
Under the separating government Felipe Calderons could himself prove Mexico economically well, but the country is in the grasp of a drug war, which cost 60,000 human lives in the last six years already.
“My government engages itself strongly to reduce the force”, explained Pena Nieto earlier this week in the oval Office US-American president Barack Obama.
I will suggest a new safety strategy, with which we can achieve this goal.
Before it went with the US president on eye level, Pena Nieto was active as a governor of its mother country Mexico.
In this closely settled, extensive part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the opinions are divided over the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town Valle del Bravo one remembers for example gladly him.
Inhabitants of the resort attribute the development of the tourism and the structure of the infrastructure to him.
In order to reach the city, one can drive on one of the motorways, the Pena Nieto build let and the one large improvement opposite the fragile, bumpy roads represent, which there were here once.
Plaques with its name hang also outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum to the climate change.
“We expect of him genuine and continuous changes”, so its friend and political allied Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, which as a congressional representative for the party Pena Nietos, which works PRI.
In particular, which concerns security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change, which needs our country so urgently.
After 81 years at power the PRI was replaced in the year 2000 from Vicente Fox.
The congressional representative Olvera admits that the party places large expectations after 12 years outside of the presidential palace of lot Pinos at Enrique Pena Nieto.
The reproaches of the opposition, to the new president be missing it at substance, reject it.
It is very committed a very direct man, and has large plans for the country.
He is a outstanding statesman, above all is he in addition, someone, that can listen.
But on the other side of the state many humans do not divide this opinion over their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also admits as Ciudad Neza, could not the contrast to the paved roads of Valle del Bravo be not larger.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and represents in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the community are from crucially urban nature.
Beginning of this year was switched on the military, in order to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and force against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a fallow land in the proximity of a large garbage depot alone in the last two years the corpses of dutzender murdered women were left to marks.
While the term of office of governor Pena Nieto became in the state Mexico over 1.000 women murdered - a statistics, which exceeds even those the city Ciudad Juarez, which for their force and the murders at innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos are the view that it is at least inappropriate concerned the problem of the woman murders during its term of office.
But in the worst case its government locked its eyes before the problem.
In a building of concrete, typically for the run down quarter, Irinea Buendia with the tears fights, when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events according to Mariana committed 2010 suicide.
But their family believes that it was murdered by her life companion.
“As I with it at home arrived, seemed it, as if its body had been washed”, remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was struck, and the corpse rigidity had already begun.
While its mother tell her story, a picture of Mariana on us looks down from the wall. It is attached beside a cross, which carries a single word: Justice.
But exactly this, so the family, one refused it up to now.
The authorities treated me, as if I am a babbler, troublemaker, Nörglerin.
They would like that one accepted its judgement simply and holds the mouth.
“However that is not possible, if there were, say so many formal defects and omissions” it.
If president Pena Nieto president-binds on Saturday receives, it takes thereby also a large responsibility.
Tens of thousands Mexican families were pulled in the last six years by violent crimes in, and the new president promised particularly to worry during its term of office about this problem.
“I hope, as a president am he like that, as he as a governor was”, say the PRI congressional representative Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But before it the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza at most are afraid exactly.
