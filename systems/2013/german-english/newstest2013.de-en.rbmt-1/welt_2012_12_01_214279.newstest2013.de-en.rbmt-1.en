The word “human right” is missing in the condition
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rivaling demonstrations in Cairo reveal deep splitting of the country.
The future condition with the sharia as basis is violently disputed.
The Egyptian president did not save with pathos.
We must create the transition.
“And that it succeeds, it lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God”, said it in public television.
Its speech was addressed to the whole people, above all however probably secular one at Christian Copt, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and.
Because they all, so far hopelessly fell out in a muddle-headed opposition, have fear.
Fear of a theocracy at the Nile of grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
It has, then Mohammed Mursi said nearly excusing, the authority of the constitutional court temporarily circumcisedly and its authority extended, “by the revolution to save”.
But which the 61-year old wants to really save engineer, who carries a doctor title of the American university of Southern California, over it itself the Egyptians are, are not whole itself the world in the clear one.
Is to be deprived of power the judicial power?
The 234 articles, which were pushed through there by the Islamist dominated 100-member condition-giving meeting in a night, 15-hour Parforceritt, are actual partial worrisome ones.
As in earlier conditions also it is called the jurisdiction in the draft, bases on the “principles of Islamic right”.
But which is called “principles”?
That was and is interpretation thing and it stands to fear that the Islamists will use the spongelike formulation and the legal clearance exerted by it for a stricter design of the sharia.
That suggests at least a newly in addition-led article: In all the sharia affairs concerned must the Al-Ashar-university advises to be pulled, the most important Islamic institution of the country with large charisma into the entire Sunni Islam.
That does not have, but it can mean that the ministry supervises the legislation, which would entail de facto incapacitating the judicial power.
Much in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation thing
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction is to remain further maintained.
These courts served rule during Mubaraks for the suppression of oppositionals.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11.000 civilians in military detention.
The state is also, then it in the draft, “the true nature of the Egyptian family” is located protects “and their moral and their values promotes”.
That is legally so in a diffuse way formulated that national institutions with the help of this article even could control contents of film art and literature.
In the plain language that means nothing else as censorship.
No article by the way fixes expressly the equality of men and women.
For another forbids insulting or slandering the prophet Mohammed and its envoys.
Which however an offense is and is like it to be punished, remains unclear.
Just as dubiously the formulation seems, which is “offense of humans” forbidden.
Is a caricature of the president there already enough or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation thing, as so much in the draft, which is present Mursi to the signature and according to him “very soon” for popular vote will be presented to the Egyptians.
“The revolution returned”
The opposition is formed for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands met in unusual unity on Friday evening at the Tahrir place in Cairo and praised to bring the Charter to case before it can step into force.
“The revolution returned and we will triumph”, said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place finisher of the presidential elections.
Nobel peace prize carrier and ex-boss of the international atomic energy authority Mohamed El-Baradei explained, the draft constitution belonged “on the garbage mountain of history”.
Via news headlines service Twitter he accused the supporters Mursis to want to lead a “putsch against the democracy”.
“If he the referendum proclaims, we to his palace will go and him fall”, said the oppositional Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers are atoned yet”, did not quote the Egyptian media the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not to want to supervise the referendum whereby it would become invalid.
“The Koran is our condition”
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood blew for its part for counter demonstration, as a precaution however not at the Tahrir place, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile bank before the Kairoer university.
Many masked women and supporter of the Salafisten participated in it and called: “The people demands the use of God law.”
They demanded from Mursi: “Clean the country!” and protested: “The Koran is our condition.”
A fight for the sovereignty over the highly symbolic Tahrir place, at which everything took its beginning, would probably have caused conditions like civil war.
Mursis supporters did not want to risk that completely obviously.
The Muslim Brotherhood explained, both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents loud and clearly would have expressed themselves.
Now the time is to let the people at the ballot box decide into which direction the country is to go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered as safe.
“The word of human rights does not even come forwards”
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious over this forced condition process, which would have actually by February to go and all social forces to merge be supposed.
The 48-year old human right lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when they sat under Mubarak in the prison or were located in court.
Because it would not divide their world view, but because for it human rights are indivisible.
But it was lambasted, condemned, arrested.
“And now the word of human rights is located in the new condition”, does not even deplore it in the discussion with the “world on Sunday”.
Mursi expansion of power on all three force in the state let the lawyer resign.
These measures are striking offences against democratic rules and Egypt into a new dictatorship will lead.
“Instead of the civil society to strengthen, set the president it de facto repealed”, deplore Saeda.
But without civilian-social organizations a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels alone left, also from the international community, which regards the ideological direction fight at the Nile with a mixture from curiosity and tension.
That could avenge itself.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: “You gebährt a monster, it any longer to control can.”
