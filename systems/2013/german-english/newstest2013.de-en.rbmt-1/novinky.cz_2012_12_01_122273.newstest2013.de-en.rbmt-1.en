“The people want that I save the republic, but I am only an amateur”, maintain Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how one comes on the idea to stand as a candidate for the office of the president?
It does not concern to me to be senator or president.
If in our country everything would function without problems, I would not stand as a candidate anywhere.
But I cannot regard no more also, how the republic is pillaged for 20 years, as thieves run around freely, while humans the taxes and the pensionable age are increased.
I did not have ambitions to become politicians.
If I see however something, to change what does not please me, then I try a solution to suggest, in order this.
And there I over 40 am independent and non-party already, and in addition to stand as a candidate have I no other possibility of affecting the things than for the office of a senator or the president.
Into the senate you created it and on the way into the castle made yourselves then alike.
Don't you turn thereby your voters the back?
I said myself the whole time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the result of the senatorial elections.
Later I specified and said that I will stand as a candidate for the office of the president, if I am selected to the senator.
My goal is however not the function. The function is an instrument, with which I mean visions realize can.
But I need as much as possible influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty does not consist however only of the fact that we grumble as a people in the tavern and before the television, but everyone annihilate, which wants to change something.
In addition come the media, which want to rob the honour, and which the freedom of the word with the freedom confound to lie.
Over me it was for example maintained that I would captivate journalists or that I was an advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
We speak about your visions.
You took up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive fortune explanations over 20 million crowns.
In addition you must change for law.
When you do not have president in this regard authority, and only the senate can bring in as a whole parliamentary bills.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When simple citizen has I for the fact used that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the smallmental policy - if someone from right or from left with a good proposal comes, these is intentionally rejected, and the population only stops.
As independent non-party have I a by far larger potential to win support at all parties represented in the parliament.
My advantage consists of the fact that I can take myself that without pigeonhole thinkings and party dogmas of each party, which for our country the best is.
Do you see yourselves as humans in the policy rather on the right of or left?
From Czech view it seems to me that the people see me rather left.
For me this right left thinking is however completely unimportant.
For me it is important that we get ahead.
It does not concern to me whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I would like to connect humans.
Always I support publicly each good solution, even if this of the KSČM or of the ODS comes, and likewise I against bad ideas will turn.
It displeases you, if someone calls you populist.
But you do not confirm that thereby, which you said straight?
If you set up a Business plan in a company, then you have also an ideal goal and a vision.
And you would like to approach this.
One can call this on my account populism, but all proposals, of which I spoke, function in the world already, or they were discussed by important experts.
But without support in the parliament only key words remain for you.
And thus you come in the policy on a long-term basis not far.
Or do you mean that you, if you talk only for a long time enough with the people will succeed, to implement for example the material and criminal liability?
I do not have other possibility.
Politician to convince and try journalists and the public to bring it on our side in order to implement these goals.
As a president it would not be for me a problem to request the chairmen of the parliament parties live on TV in addition the material and criminal liability for politician, an official, to anchor judges and state lawyers legally.
And the responding would have to then say if necessary, why them this to reject.
A strong personality, that refers to drawbacks, can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct choice of the president, who was a earnings of the public pressure.
I say completely clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try, allied for my opinions and visions to find.
With the policy I began just and try to find for my program the support of the majority.
I always try to judge the things themselves; and if it does not fold, then I decrease in six years again into the private sector.
That sounds little, as if Okamura Czech Republic should save.
I am not a rescuer.
I know that I reach alone nothing; therefore I spoke with several well-known personalities about whether they would like to stand as a candidate not also for the senate.
I spoke e.g. with Radim Jančura, which rejected however because of overwork.
In addition I supported the investigative lady journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud with the trade with light fuel oil.
My candidacy began myself I with the condition that humans are deeply dissatisfied, but am no longer safe I now.
At all to the elections did not go to sixty percent of the voters, and those, which went, selected usually representatives of the establishment.
In the senate we are only two independent ones thereby.
The people selected such a senate composition that changes will be only very with difficulty achievable.
Nevertheless I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district captains.
Do you think about the establishment of their own party?
About it I did not think yet, because I do not have time to examine the past of each potential party member and also not at all the money for it has.
I do not have yet times money for the president campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
They do not have money?
They speak of fortune explanations, how their would look?
I estimate my private possession on approximately 60 millions CZK.
In Prague I have a property with a value of 25 million, a apartment for approximately 10 million, a further for 8 million, an art collection, which are worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million. And then I have still a few millions on the account.
Aston Martin was by the way a child dream - James Bond always pleased me, how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and fought at the same time against the bad.
They do not drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and to have money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the republic, but you would not like to invest your own money in it.
That is not convincing straight.
I do not have a 15 million for the campaign.
Am I to make debts?
I put already 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have sponsors, shows that my program arouses probably not all too much interest.
And I am not obligated to deny the campaign from own means.
The costs of the campaign are covered strictly speaking by my content as a senator.
But of the senator content alone I could not live; so I e.g. my son would not know the English school financiers, whom costs 30,000 per month.
If I wanted to make only money, I would not stand as a candidate for nothing at all.
Do you remain thus active as entrepreneurs further, in order to have your getting along?
Didn't you say that you will go back these activities?
But is not connected with the height of the content.
As promised, has I mean activities partly gone back.
Thus my deputy becomes e.g. in the spring a managing director of the travel agency.
The people want to see me as Samaritan, who saves the republic.
But I must live nevertheless also on something.
To which monthly income were you accustomed as entrepreneurs?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also further like that.
As a president will I mean enterprises however completely to stop.
