Singapore needs babies for the rescue of the economy
The singaporeans lay the blame for it that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the costs of the real estate and children's education.
“The population of Singapore must grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you am my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civil duty and create we lives!
It appears unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless - or straight therefore - they became at the beginning of this year in Singapore a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local of sayings like e.g. “Pushing will one “bao” (loaf) into the furnace, in order to make itself over the low birth rate in Singapore hilariously.
The advertising company BBH, which turned the video, protects hope that the advertising spots in hilarious way reached, on the problem to make attentive.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of the music to bring the people to it its “national obligation” fulfills.
This is somewhat only for the Internet, therefore we had to arrange it hilariously and funny.
This concerns the largest problem in this country.
With reproducing we are the worst ones of the world, therefore we that it concerns a topic, noticed around which we to worry had.
We e.g. knew that the government had tried much, like the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed Dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, they did not lead however compellingly to success.
Therefore we thought: Why don't we make somewhat as creative as possible to how e.g. compose in order to concern this problem, a RAP?
1.2 children
Who does not take this topic easily, is the government of Singapore.
Each year spends it 1,300 US Dollar on political measures, in order to suggest the citizens to get more children.
A package of the government for married couples and parents granted up to 15,000 dollar per child, extends the maternity leave and distributes fiscal advantages.
But everything had so far little success.
Singapore is enriches, high-technological city state in the southeast of Asia, which admits also for the conservatism of its governments and its strict social controls is.
In accordance with its national population authority the birth rate is at present about 1,2 children per woman.
The last mark, when this rate over 2 amounted to - which admits actual also as replacement rate was in the year 1976.
Thus why don't the singaporeans any more children get?
Tan Wei Ming, directress for before and family policy of the national population authority, says that this improves training” and “larger career opportunities” on “to be led back is.
“This made humans to marry and a family form except substantially for more options possible regarding purposes in life to have and priorities set”, explains it.
These changes in the social conditions contributed to the higher number at singles and at delaying the marriage and births, whose result is the decrease of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile an immigration policy, which aims at a drastic rise of immigrations, in order to work against the decrease of the population, led to resentment with the local population.
In Singapore there are web pages, where hardly covered xenophobia flowers against many new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese, who are criticized for the fact that they keep the wages low and do not integrate themselves.
The rise of immigration is regarded also as one of the reasons for the fact that the government party in Singapore obtained last year their worst election result since independence.
Since the elections an attempt was undertaken to correct the problem with higher contributions and deliveries for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the well-known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the tax revenues, which has health costs and the immigration policy, the example Singapore shows also unexpected consequences.
The government tries to reach that so many small apartments are not built.
So it has already also effects on the housing market.
The authority for urban development began to check the number at small apartments which admit as “shoe boxes” are and in certain areas of the city be built may.
These apartments have a floor space of 46 square meters and to show a large sales impact.
However the concern exists that they can promote the lifestyle the singles, and that they deter the building firms to build large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its “shoe boxes” can be sold very many faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are around days and even weeks faster sell off than the larger housing units.
This leads to the fact that they are very much better for our cash flow.
It admits however that the new standards give clearer orientations, to which before obstacles were put into the way to the developers, if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to a rise of the national birth rate, the discussions with the singaporeans, which are in the financial quarter work, to infer that they will not have large effect.
“The people are stressed strongly, the apartments and also the education are expensive, why it is postponed by many” says a young manager.
The children can get others.
“For me it is important, over my own money and time to order” says another, approximately twenty years old man.
Men and women would start their career, the stress and the costs of the property and the education as reasons for the fact that they cannot have children.
Therefore the singaporeans have the final say, if it concerns, children to get - there the government can do still so much.
