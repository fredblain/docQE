Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal weapon market
Portion of legal weapons of criminal offences extremely small
The Russian ministry of the Interior plans an aggravation of the weapon law for private owners of weapon.
With it the authorities react to the recent events: Injured with shootings on weddings as well as seven dead with the rampage the Muscovite of the lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police wants to forbid carrying non-deadly weapons in the public and the age for the possession of firearms of 18 to 21 years to raise.
The chairman of the Duma committee for security and corruption fight, Irina Jarowaja, supported the proposal and promised that the changes at the weapon law are submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not all are content with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by “attraction of the screws”.
In the Internet an open letter was published, whose author - representatives of different weapon federations - of the authorities demands to take from “senseless aggravations” distance.
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very small, expressed the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the ministry of the Interior 142 crimes with use of the registered weapons in the process of six months in 2012 were committed, while for the same period altogether 1.168 thousand crimes were registered.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that an aggravation of the law for private owners of weapon will not hold criminal ones from it, to avail itself on the black market.
At present one can find according to in Moscow each possible weapon for little money to the authors.
Meanwhile the ministry of the Interior stresses that the spreading of illegal weapons under control is.
Supplier: from the factories to the officers
The weapons arrive over several channels at the black market.
There are five such forward channels, tell former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who was active ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the general staff.

The first channel is the army and/or the military, i.e. weapons, which were stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen both by the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern themselves”, say Baranez.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, which are stolen from vigilantes by criminal ones.
Baranez describes that for this weapons count, which were stolen both from the weapon chambers of the police and directly by employees of the law enforcement agencies.
Further illegaly sold weapons originate from military weapon camps.
With many military camps it came frequently to explosions.
“There are proofs that it concerned with some cases arson, to hush up around the absence from weapons to”, say the former military personnel.
Also the weapon manufacturers make a contribution to the black market in accordance with Baranez.
“Nowadays there are innumerable private war plants, those the international competition does not withstand and therefore the weapons under the hand on the black market, approximately in Moscow, does not dissipate”, reports the expert.
A further channel of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There there is a its own, production sometimes relating to crafts as well as a mafia, smuggling organized”, describes the former military personnel.
From where do the weapons come?
Experts computed, each of the five channels at the supply of the black market with illegal weapons has which portion approximately.
In the year 2011 a report was written by the center for analyses of problems and national administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the ministry of the Interior and the federal service for national statistics, kriminologische literature and publicly accessible data on portals about weapons.
The predominant part of the illegal weapons comes the investigators according to from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the “debt of responsible persons, those in their work with weapons to do arrived”, are called it in the report.
The data according to the researcher 17% of the weapons originate from conflict areas, 14% decrease on thefts with weapon production, and 5% originate from illegal excavations.
A merchandiser of a weapon shop, which does not want to be mentioned by name, insures that for a long time nobody buys weapons, which are found with illegal excavations more, since they became outdated.
According to it is more frequent that resellers procure themselves the supplies in a weapon camp.
Over a wo1 a weapon, for example a pistol of the type TT, is bought.
The weapon is issued and handed over by the fence.
“There the reseller brings the weapon into the city and sells her for 900 euros per piece with two magazines”, tells he
“The police knows naturally about all and leads therefore, if it cannot keep the plan for uncovering of crimes, periodically control purchases with resellers through, who offer, add illegal weapons” the merchandiser.
“As in the luxury shop”
Buyers and salespersen find most frequently over acquaintance to each other.
I had regarded web pages and blogs, became attentive as someone on me and me suggested to the station “Begowaja” coming, where a person would wait for me, who would bring me to a certain place, where we could negotiate then the price.
I experienced the price for the weapon only there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
“Around a weapon to procure, I need an acquaintance, who has contacts”, tells the merchandiser. “I have so an acquaintance, but I do not trust him”.
There are resellers on the markets, but there one must go and arrange oneself with a code as “from Iwan Iwanowitsch, who lets align that the daughter lost a tooth”.
I come at present even to some impact rings over an acquaintance, who I trust.
It supplies the impact rings to me with likewise only, because he knows that I do not blow the whistle him.
Beginners look for weapons on different ways.
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez in the middle of the 1990er tried as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article to this topic.
The patterns did not change according to it.
He got a photo album, in which “all possible one” was shown.
“I felt as in the luxury shop”, remember the military personnel.
The buyer gets the cat in the bag according to Baranez not, but can everything out try.
I as a potential customer buy not simply only, but drive with the salesperson into the forest, and there we set up a target.
“I can shoot then there, and if I am convinced of it that the weapon has a good shot, negotiate we with one another”, describe the expert the action.
Buy from the sofa
Internet search engines point search results to web pages and groups in “Vkontakte”, where weapons are offered “for different purposes”.
Neither any papers are needed nor give it personal meetings.
“You need only the suitable sum money”, are called it in the advert on the web page “combat pistol or rifle buy”.
There user your orders gives up and places inquiries.
Also to persons under age one sells?
“Natural without license”, asks user “Iwan” (literal quotation).
“Purchase a TT. Moscow”, reads the laconic inquiry of “Fedorenkow”.
The federal security agency switched recently innumerable illusory web pages, and buyers, who want to acquire weapons, go to the service in droves into the net.
The people come like hungry fish with feeding and land then in Siberia and may coal dig

I heard of the following pattern: The web page is normally abroad registered, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible persons accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money over a cash-point dispenser.
“As answer it receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon”, reports the press spokesman of the nonprofit organization “Pravo well oryzhie” Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that one can go out in the end also empty and come behind the bars, if one places an inquiry on a web page.
