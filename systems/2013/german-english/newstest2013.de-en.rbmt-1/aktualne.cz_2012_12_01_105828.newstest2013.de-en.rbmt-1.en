NKÚ boss: Control of the black system fails to the policy by being to blame for
Czech Republic ordered in connection with public contracts over good control instances and adequate laws, drops back however into their application.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz this says the vice-president of the highest board of control (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it must be used correctly - and this is in my opinion with us not the case”, commentates Kala the current situation.
To a similar result apparently also common control comes by Czech and German examiners.
As negative practical example he states the attitude of prime minister Petr Ne čas to the so-called “black system”.
Recently did the prime minister say is the fact that the ODS would not trouble the entrepreneurs with controls - thus now forbidden or permitted the system?
“A law must have its validity nevertheless, and if is somewhat legally forbidden, then nevertheless simply the government chairman cannot come, and in its activity” Kala obstruct, determine the board of control, whose obligation is just control of the adherence to the law.
At the meeting of the committee of control of the chamber of deputies you spoke about a common Czech-German project, within whose framework the laws of both countries were compared with one another concerning public contracts.
About what did it go there concretely?
It concerns thereby a parallel examination, with which we began before approximately two years.
Simplified said, it concerns that the European legislation specifies, how public contracts are to be handled. Whereupon the legislation of the individual nations construct. And finally there is still actual practical application.
We compared all of this with one another, and although the examination is not yet final, we could notice extremely interesting differences. Generally said, the laws are with us some more “more strictly and perfectly”, actual application however are better perhaps even in Germany in some parameters.
Thus it is confirmed that it is not enough to set up new and more exact rules again and again. One must be concerned also with the actual application of the right.
To what extent you can the project be an assistance? What results for you from this project?
Straight such a common control could contribute to the fact that we stop constantly endeavoring us around a perfecting of the laws and the lowering and counterbalancing from thresholds to if this positively does not affect itself apparently particularly.
Economy means to acquire a thing at a reasonable price (which not always the lowest price is) and to exclude illegitimate enrichment or criminal actions.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps is it even like that we load the system in this way only with excessive “paper stuff”, and those, which look for gaps in the system, it substantially more simply have to use the system as if the thresholds remained higher.
They speak about the problems during the practical conversion of the Czech assignment law.
How does the control system in Germany function?
Does it give here a similar authority as our NKÚ, or does function the system differently?
Which concerns the authorities, then the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Audit Office, which is just as developed as with us and likewise a council has, who is only somewhat differently educated. In principle both authorities work however similarly.
Also the authority is comparable to a certain measure, whereby Germany is however a Federal State, i.e. that there is these Court of Auditors also in the individual Federal states - in it the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may control only Federal Funds, what corresponds to our national means.
Public means, which are administered with us by the districts and communities, are subject there to control of the state audit offices.
What does the German legislation concern, is simpler than ours?
Generally I would compare this only reluctantly without concrete information. Nontheless Germany is in a way often called model, whereby one cannot however certainly say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because of the fact that the examiners are better there?
That certainly not, but as said: I do not like such comparisons particularly gladly.
For this it is to be still marked that also those countries, which are for us a model have to fight likewise with problems.
Otherwise wouldn't they admit yes nothing from a co-operation with our authority?
What the Czech legislation concerns, which meaning had the amendment of the assignment law for your authority, feels you already any effects?
Considering its that this novella is only short time into force, it does not affect itself it with our examinations so far.
Since our controls later take place, one must count here on a certain delay.
Effects we feel so far rather in the preparatory phase of future controls - in such a way we introduced the new controller “recognition of risks of the inefficiency” and checked and analyzed with this nearly 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will naturally affect ourselves, since the thresholds change, the conditions for certain kinds by advertisements were modified among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or the system with further bureaucracy are loaded?
I think that this law determines a step into the right direction is and hopes that this acceptance is confirmed.
However the problem can occur that the rules become “stricter” and no more not to be kept to be able.
Already under the previous rules an examination the submitted persons are in relation to the carrier (for example, in case of an operational program of the regional policy, the regional advice) to that effect accountable that each disregard of the assignment law of an injury of the household discipline equals.
Is it then however meaningful to make the law still stricter?
In my opinion not in this way.
The system must exclude those, which want to attack and abuse the system, and not those to punish, which committed a formal defect, which does not affect actual decision making.
Such a system sets only the bureaucracy under still larger pressure.
Where here is the way out?
We say first of all, which way is not goal-prominent.
The prime minister said recently the fact that the ODS would not trouble the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called “black system” - which is called that exactly?
Is the black system now forbidden or permitted?
A law must have its validity nevertheless, and if is somewhat legally forbidden, then nevertheless simply the government chairman cannot come, and obstruct the board of control, whose obligation is just control of the adherence to the law, in his activity.
He can say: “We amend the law and permit the thing”, but it cannot say that we do in such a way, as if nothing would be.
The assignment law contains relatively strict rules over the formal execution of certain procedures - and that is also correct for the protection of the public competition.
On the other side it is tragic in addition, if the bidder with the best offer is excluded alone due to formal defects.
The law will be perfect never, but it must be used correctly - and that is what is missing with us in my opinion.
