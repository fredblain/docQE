Daily drink butter - and 168 years become old
In the south of Azerbaijan many humans reach Biblically a great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A tracing in the country, in which 97-year old are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan many humans reach Biblically a great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A tracing in the country, in which 97-year old are still comparatively young.
The trip by the Talysch mountains is to be called wild and romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the winding road, past at closely wooded hills, rapid rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one could mean, one would be in the Black Forest.
But that is here the deepest south of Azerbaijan, which is border to Iran only few kilometers remotely.
Here the Caucasian ethnic group Taly lives, from which much does not admit is, except that it perfectly Persian as well as Aserisch speaks and is very long-lived.
Last stop is Lerik.
The small small town shows off also to massively guessed/advised architecture from Soviet times, which does not want so at all to fit into the pictorial mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, are too cumbersome start from of Azerbaijan capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers one needs eight hours, because the road is only single-lane one.
The incredible wealth, which the country owes to its oil in the Caspian sea, did not arrive here in the province yet.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced of the fact that Lerik has things for tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May with the euro vision song festival - and in the next year to have we here a festival of oldest humans of the world”, says Fatulayeva.
She is a directress of the museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the résumé of approximately eight dozen, those documented Taly from the area older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
That is my grandfather, he here became 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years still another child witnessed
But disputed star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Șirali Müslümov, which is to have become 168 years old.
A birth certificate does not give it however.
And in view of oldest documented humans, who became 122 years old, Müslümovs age appears nevertheless extremely doubtful.
“1805 it was born in the region, 1973 died here it”, describes Fatulayeva.
The man was three times married and 23 children had, at the age of 136 years is he still another daughter to have witnessed.
Did Șirali Müslümov charge itself thus regarding its age around a few decades?
In addition, rem Brandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of the aged ones in Central Asia.
“Remarkable many hochaltrige humans gives it also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan”, says Scholz, “also in Sardinien lives extremely many very old men”.
Because of missing documents however no scientific proof is to be led across the age, particularly since person condition registers were missing.
Each day becherweise melted butter
Fact is however that humans of the region approximately achieve a Biblical age around Lerik remarkably frequently.
At present it gives 20 persons, who are older than 100 years.
Why thus here do so many aged ones live in the south?
The aserische travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains with the special genes Taly.
Museum directress Fatulayeva against it believes that it is because of the nutrition.
But that calculated the calorie-rich food Taly should be so healthy, the meat, bread and above all milk products love and of those many daily a glass melted butter to drink, do not appear also straight from nourish-scientific view plausibly.
Or is it the original way of life, which keeps humans young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement nearby the city Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years it is still comparatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, which states, to have 143 descendants lives that in a simple timber building, is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It sits on the ground with a butter barrel, which and rolls her untiringly.
Eight humans live here under a roof, under it one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are for a long time grandparents.
Also two infants jump around.
In the kitchen one prepares tea, which is served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu glass ones for the guests.
Mirzayevas white teeth stand perfectly in line up and to member, under their headscarf hide them long, light brown plaits, which their son reveals proudly before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, then they never went out me and kept their color.
“I used, say shampoo also never” Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to the life
She ate in each case that, which came from its own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life long I did not buy only once in the supermarket food.
Then it tells of its man, who was in the army.
It was worst in the time after the Second World War.
But everything became better, than the “loved father” Heydar Aliyew took over the rudder.
Propaganda sounds strangely from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven around the father figure of the nation, its country like a dictator governed, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was at power, later took over its son Ilham the rudder.
There is nevertheless no emergency among of Azerbaijan old persons.
, Mirzayeva receives 230 Manat (for instance the same sum in euros) monthly as pension, for local conditions an amount, on which one can live well.
And perhaps also Mirzayevas is right for a long time turned grey son: “The old persons enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved, cared and are happy.
If that is not a reason to remain as for a long time as possible alive
