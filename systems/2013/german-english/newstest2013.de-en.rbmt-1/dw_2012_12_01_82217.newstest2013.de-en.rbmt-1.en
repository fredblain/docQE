Szabo: “Germans must play larger role”
Germany contained in the vote over the admission of Palestine of the voice.
According to Stephen Szabo, Experte for US-European relations, balances Berlin thereby on a narrow diplomatic degree.
German wave: Beginning of the week had first signaled Germany that it would be correct against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then however Berlin contained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza, not.
Now Germany must be however careful due to its special relationship with Israel.
But I believe at the same time that it does not support also the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - opposite Israel to be without however too critical.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011 Germany likewise contained of the voice, when it concerned to furnish a no-fly zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Does it fall Germany heavily to refer with important international topics a clear position?
Yes, which is correct.
That is because of the fact that it changes straight its foreign policy over away from a policy, which became as it were from the USA gemanaged to a German foreign policy.
Aggravatingly it is added that the Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are thus between the fronts.
One expected of them that they play a more independent role, to it is however not accustomed it.
I believe, her still approach themselves to her role, but they are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Great Britain.
What means a “normal” foreign policy concretely from German view?
It shows the readiness to refer with national interests also positions those is independent from those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, thus from the exports and its relations to certain regions, about Russia, China or the Near East.
Of Germany economic interests are to a certain degree different than those the other large would like and therefore must Germany its interests to protect.
Did these economic interests have influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand Germany has large sales markets in the Near East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore it must be careful, the public, in addition, the elite not to push in the Arab countries before the head.
That plays in any case a role.
But I would want to attach also not too much weight to that, that am no completely one-sided relationship.
But it plays in any case an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany damage its relations with the USA, by containing with important decisions of the voice, with the vote over Palestine?
I believe, in Europe and even in the USA prevail large understanding for the German position.
Therefore I do not believe that this was a so dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany thereby will get into practice even a certain respect.
Because it signals nevertheless that as international players it is seriously taken and its interests to be considered to have.
There are different opinions in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.
The USA against it expressed themselves clearly for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?
Due to the American home policy these differences always existed.
I believe that the government among Obama has secretly probably a good deal understanding for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can not represent this position publicly naturally.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not at all so large, as they always appear.
If you regard the relations between Obama and Premierminister Netanjahu, then Obama is not at all like that enthusiastically from Netanyahu's politics.
Does it fall Germany heavily, its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one to agree and the position of the most important partners in the European Union on the other side?
I believe, exactly make it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be naturally a little more simply for the Germans, if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, what at present not the case is.
Thus they cannot to be part of a broader line and have instead things from their own position to advance.
They make that straight with the euro.
I believe, in the future Germany a prominent role will take over, to Europe to a European position to urge.
That is naturally not simply for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always already a sensitive topic.
But I believe that the Germans it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany want to take over at all a leading role?
Or does Germany the guiding role fall still heavily?
Germany is not accustomed yet to it, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, falls it the country still heavily, a larger role to play.
If we look at ourselves for example the euro crisis, there each mark, if Germany accepts a larger role, becomes most diverse anti-German feelings freely.
That does not make it simple for the Germans.
That is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is so seen in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be sensitive to most diverse neighbours and opinions and that is not simple.
Now does the influence of the USA in the European policy decrease continuously, the European Union fills for the moment this vacuum however not, who remains there otherwise?
The Germans will have to play simply a larger role.
Even if it does not please them, it them is unpleasant and it makes still many more unpopular - la vie c'est!
