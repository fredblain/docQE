The public prosecutor's office tried Friday to state that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - accused for the largest exposure of confidential information of US-American history - several opportunities missed to weight about the mistreatment suffered allegedly by it in military detention.
With a cross questioning Mannings during a before-judicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden fine that documents it did not exhibit to weekly visits, which had made prison officials during Mannings of nine-month term of imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia any complaints over his treatment.
One day before the cross questioning, which was held due to a request of the defense for the rejection of the accusation - Manning had been already sufficiently punished by the hard term of imprisonment - had Manning stated, it would have the suicide in the prison considered.
The secret service analyst of the US-army, which in June 2010 one arrested, is accused, during its office hours in Iraq thousand confidential documents to have stolen.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks in the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday fine with Manning went through the forms, which had filled out officials after their meetings with Manning during its detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had served a sentence prison conditions intensified by July 2010 until April 2011 under.
The officials placed Manning Fragen and would label its answers.
When fine asked it on Friday to the forms, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as “excellent” and the treatment by the facility altogether as “very professionally”.
The forms, so fine, did not contain complaints over mistreatment, although the officials had asked Manning directly to his treatment.
Manning answered, he had expressed his doubts verbally and had discussed and had indicated the officials these with him to be concerned as these. They were not logged however.
“You would label (after meeting of the doubts) “no problems”, and the meant not necessarily that I said nothing at all”, so Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, asked Manning also, why it did not weight about its treatment, when he met in January 2011 with a committee, that should examine from him some months before on a form mentioned suicidal ideation.
Manning answered, its intention during this meeting had consisted of letting its observation status downgrade for the “prevention of injuries”.
The military stated, it had it this restrictive status - which stands a stage under the suicide endangerment - to its and the protection of others assigned.
“I wanted to convince employees of the fact that I well was, and the observation status for the prevention of injuries gets rid of (...) around a from my point of view higher quality of life to reach to be able”, said Manning.
Manning stated at Thursday to its arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held approximately two months, before he was moved in July 2010 into the prison of naval base Quantico in Virginia.
He said, in Kuwait he had considered the suicide and had become once unconscious due to the heat.
Does not know to be allowed, what with it or in the outside world happens, is loading.
“My world diminished on Camp Arafjon, on this cage”, said Manning on Thursday.
I thought, I in this cage would die.
When it was moved after Quantico, Manning had spent the majority of its days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
One permitted it only one mattress, a cover, flip-flop, clothes and its eyeglasses.
Manning said, he had tried to remain in motion because on day it was forbidden to sleep or only lie down.
Always it had to sleep with light, which penetrated from the outside into its cell.
If it turned at night and guards could not see its face any longer, one had waked it up, so that he turns back again.
In January 2011 Mannings lawyer raised formally objection against the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011 Manning was moved into the military prison from away Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday the judge asked Manning likewise to an accusation, which it had raised in its statement on Thursday - in such a way he had one night naked in his cell in Quantico to sleep and with a morning counting naked before guards and other prisoners to be located have.
Manning had stated, he had never had the opportunity during this counting coat itself with his cover.
For the questioning on Friday Manning indicated, he had concluded from an instruction of his guard that he the cover, with which he could himself have covered, fall let should. It admitted however that nobody had requested it in addition.
On Thursday Manning had stated that he was forced at the previous night to sleep naked. It would have tried before to show an official that it does not represent a danger for itself.
Manning said to the official, he could not have used the federation of its pants or his flip-flops, in order to injure itself, however done this.
At this night, then Manning stated, its pants, flip-flops and eyeglasses from its cell was removed.
Its lawyers hope that the judge its detention experiences will drastically reduce at least to consider and his detention measure, should it with his negotiation before the military court be condemned. This is set for beginning of next year.
The defense indicated that Manning will admit itself of smaller offences for guilty, while other charges, which than are too extremely regarded, are to be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is set for this weekend. A justification of the prison conditions is expected by the public prosecutor's office.
The Pentagon remains with its position that in accordance with Manning the regulations one held, which kept prisoners for all under highest safety precautions in Quantico are valid.
Among the charges against Manning rank the promotion of the enemy, illegitimate publication of secretofficial information in the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
If it is found in all charges for guilty, a lifelong detention threatens him.
