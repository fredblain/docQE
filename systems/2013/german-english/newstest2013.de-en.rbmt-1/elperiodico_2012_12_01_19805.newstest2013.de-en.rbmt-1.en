Privacy
In accordance with the dictionary it concerns thereby the characteristic privately or “that range of the private life, where one has requirement on protection from each kind of interference”.
What is private for someone under 16 years?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and the social networks?
Does he understand the dangers, to which he exposes himself, if he admits situations makes, which he would not divide in the material life in the Internet?
El Periódico interviewed five young people at the age between 10 and 15 years, which are frequent in the net on the way.
In four of the cases they linked the term with “somewhat very own” on personal level and “on the password and the user”, if they used it on the social networks.
“My deepest secrets I would not announce in a post office” say the 10 years old Jorge with the attempt, the meaning of “privately” in web pages such as Facebook, Twitter, to explain Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where it has for two years accounts.
“Those are very confidential secrets, my mother may them, but not, he confirms the whole world”.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from plays.
I drive myself out also my time with acquaintance.
“I would not divide a photo, which is not from me, or of someone, that the fool makes” says he.
The boy is itself over it in the clear one that it is wrong, obscene photos, to write of naked ones, to publish from crimes to or insulting or comments by force.
Jorge insures to know 35 friends whom it has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are used.
Among them also the mother, that has the password to one of the accounts.
I registered at Twitter, in order to express me and write interesting Tweets.
“I white, whether someone answers me, I do not load it only highly” add it.
“The social networks are entertaining, I can fast with relatives in the distance or with friends speak” indicate he.
Asked it answers that he would never accept an invitation of unknown quantities.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to it, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year old José lies differently.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My space and Ask. In Ask it admits not to know 20 of the persons whom it added its friend list.
“Not, because we have somewhat in common, for example music” frightens me, indicates it.
According to the boy nobody made suggestions for it or asked it for its address or telephone number.
“If someone me pressed or her of me required, I remove him simply from my user account” admit he.
José announced itself to Ask, after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
Experiences are not unknown to the boy, which one knows today as Cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was extorted in a social network.
They threatened it and required money.
“It never experienced, who it was”, insures it.
According to José the victim did not close the user account.
“It made it only private.”
Afterwards it describes a set of steps, in order to configure a user account surely.
In contrast to Jorge this boy would upload photos from acquaintance in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, which I would do, if it is me unsympathetic or I want to wipe it one out.
“However I know that this Cyberbullying is” explains he.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, Lehrerin for English with university conclusion in education and learning, means that around the children and young people to orient, be understood it must that it is purpose of the social networks, to inform.
“The Internet developed as medium for the search for information; with the appearance of these sides the rules changed however”, say them.
Porras describes that the university graduate Marc Prensky, Inhaber of a master title in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work formed “digitally native and immigrant” these terms to the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital native are they, the children and young people, which grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants, who are to teach them, where we still learn nevertheless” say it.
It explained that it concerns a complex topic, “because we of them require that they have a defined criterion over it, what may be spread, published or said, and this at an age, where the ripe one for it is not sufficient.”
“You should be also discriminating, if it is them at the most important one, like to be, thousands friends to have, without over the consequences to think”, add it.
According to the specialist the most effective way is to teach the children and young people what privacy is, them questions to place, which it brings to thinking.
“To you to say, her are it not to do, functioned not”, do not say he.
Porras calls afterwards some possibilities: There are things, which you would not tell to a stranger. Why do you make it then in the Internet?
Or: Would it please you, if one publishes a photo of you, how that, which you published from a friend?
Do you know, what the others publish over you?
Did you ask the other persons before for permission, if you labeled photos of celebrations?
And still another question: Do all have to know, what you do in each moment?
A further point is to give to understand them that they must act on-line, as they do it to off-lines.
There is the same rules.
“Someone outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must be valid for the social networks”, explains it.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, basic school teacher and educational advisor, commentates that it indispensably that parents the guidelines of the social networks read carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid bases, in order to talk with their children about the meaning of opening one user account in the Internet.
“For example the age, or which one may divide or publish” explains he.
According to Guardia the children to the lesson “you must are not with strangers to speak” to be reminded.
