“Trademark protection” in China: If Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-well-known mark, Polo Ralph Lauren likewise.
What however is Armani Polo?
Behind it hides itself a designation completely officially registered in China, which has to do however nothing with the origin enterprises.
It enjoys so long protection nevertheless, as the actual name givers do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they get right.
“It will for foreigners ever more with difficulty to protect their marks in China”, says Thomas Pattloch, Anwalt in the chancellery Taylor Wessing, who is specialized in patent right injuries in the Far East.
Each week lands a new case on my desk.
Already a few additional letter is enough to the imitators, so that they may announce their marks.
Thus will from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada lets one Prada Kny register.
Also German enterprises are in this way legally copied, for instance manufacturer of sports equipment Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a folder with entries of the office for mark in Peking.
On 14 September 2010 there a Chinese enterprise let the registered trade mark Zegna DF Puma protect, an art name, which availed itself also with the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in the injured one of mental property is well-known.
In the large cities there are more-floor department stores, which sell almost exclusively falsifications.
Stalemate hole cases however are different: On behalf its mandators it proceeds against the fact that Chinese enterprises receive the right from the office for mark completely officially to use a designation which is already elsewhere protected.
The Chinese call “fear for Mingpai”, a front seat passenger mark.
The word orients itself on “fears for DAK SCN”.
Thereby women are meant who fish themselves rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of a debt
“Is business-damaging that, one must it fight”, demands stalemate hole.
“The mark is watered, the all attitude disappears, the image damage is enormous.”
The financial losses and the legal costs of the industries concerned go into the millions, particularly with expensive presentation products.
According to the market study company CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year the third biggest market for luxury items and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the register of trademarks are difficult to reach and go into the money.
Up to nine the procedure can drag on years, with uncertain exit.
Stalemate hole reports of cases, in which the court rejected complaints, because after the long duration the complained of name had become the “market reality”.
If the plaintiff has pitch, he must pay to the plagiarist even money, because he injured its mark in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes here the law of the jungle prevails.
Famous cases concern also graphic elements.
2009 lost Daimler a law case with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, that enterprise, which recently the Germans concrete pump farmer finery master took over.
The Chinese may use therefore to today a emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo, which reminded of BMW; the controversy was conciliation, Geely had to change it.
The mode manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of a debt.
The office for mark CTMO in Peking admits that it gave 2010 there because of too small personal and space equipment of bottlenecks.
Last year one returned however from the “emergency situation in the workflow to normality”.
Thus the existence of rough opposition procedures sank by 22 percent.
One locked nearly 57,000 of such cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still 81,500 objections wait nevertheless for completion in the office.
On the other hand to concern much costs
Like so often in China the numbers are impressing.
Last year were received with the CTMO more as 1.4 million requests for trademark protection, nearly a third more than 2010.
That is a record and means that China would start the list of the new applications in all world one behind the other for the tenth time, communicates the authority.
That is valid also for the existence of all valid brand names, altogether 5.5 million pieces.
2011 was taken 1.8 billion Yuan at fees.
Simplified that means that each registration on average costs 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand to concern a multiple costs, as the case of the German exempt private company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the company fights against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans could reach that its illegal production of imitated motor vehicle parts was dug.
But the imitator secured itself further the Chinese rights at the mark Freudenberg.
One has missed, since in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical specialities in Munich.
The office for mark CTMO also rejected the objection of the Munich.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got quite, but the litigants continue to fight until today.
One must watch out infernally
Now the affair before highest Gerichtshof is pending.
Wentzler is confident to bring the thing to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But it says also: “The procedure is extremely complex and costs us much time, money and nerves.”
The internal costs let themselves hardly number, had the company archives even one hundred years old documents to examine, in order to furnish proofs.
Before five years Freudenberg offered in vain a “high six-digit amount of euro” to the opposite side for the settlement.
“To it one sees, like much us that is worth”, says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten to back-slosh even to Europe.
If Imitatoren secure themselves unprotected marks there.
So a Chinese manufacturer wanted to announce the name Freudenberg for shoes and leathers in Germany.
This trading area gave up the company for a long time, nevertheless could turn it the registration away.
“One must watch out infernally”, says Wentzler.
Both it and the lawyer stalemate hole guess/advise German enterprises to be very careful with business with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark laws on the contrary the foreigners of “everything that somehow worth of protection is, should also in China announce”, as Wentzler says.
Otherwise that can become many more expensive than the registration.
Indeed: If Freudenberg in the last act of its mark drama is subject, then one would have to probably pay the opposite side royalties for the own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed in the questionable segment from the market.
