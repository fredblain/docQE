Rakfisk from Norway: Is the most ill-smelling fish of the world?
The five million inhabitant of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the success secret of the country have to do something with the local appetite on rather evil-smelling fish?
One takes a selection of overripe cheese places.
One places it in the midst of a heap of dirty, damp sport clothes.
And leave it there one week.
So approximately one must imagine the nose-numbing smell of Rakfisk, one of large delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small city Fagernes, about three hours remotely from Oslo.
There is here snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, to which simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt covered trout, which - dependent on how stinking one gladly would have its fish - up to one year in water is fermented.
If into Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather becomes colder, Norwegians flow here to a celebration into Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, really very captivating speciality.
“One eats it roughly and rinses it then with a glass of Aquavit down”, says Havard Halvarsen, which actually works in the local fire station, but when so-called “Rakfisk general” organizes also the festival.
Over people small fish cubes consume and take us around in addition large quantities of alcohol to itself.
“Man people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk”, say Havard.
The Spirituose can displace the smell.
I cost some bits.
If one avoids it to bring the Rakfisk in nose proximity he is not badly - about like Sushi, which has a quite long bus travel behind itself.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different one, by far poorer Norwegian epoch, than there were and fish in the autumn in hermetic seawater barrels were soaked still no cooling possibilities.
In the deepest winter it was taken out then after long fermentation and - certainly with the aid of alcohol absorbed senses - consumes.
Still before a generation thousands Norwegians saw themselves in the search for work in a forced manner to leave their country and emigrated mainly into the USA.
Today the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted from a flourishing job market, high wages and a comprehensive health service.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who before not yet all too long time by far enrich was as Norway, flow immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, although strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It belongs to the more expensive courts, which one can buy here.
But here yes everything is actually expensive - a small glass beer or sand-yielded costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not create it often into the world press, and that does not seem to disturb most people.
Here one hates it still to call differently Breivik with the name - that racist right-wing extremist, who shot last year of 77 men, women and children.
Instead one refers only to the “incident from 22 July”.
Norwegians have trouble to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in their pacific country.
For the today's wealth of Norway the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries of the world is mainresponsible since the early 1970's.
“However oil is not the only reason, why we so well are, say” Anna, our waitress, who embodies round tray with ripe Rakfisk distributed and with their long blond hair and that stinging blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are in as say one - prudent people.
Their English is here immaculate exactly like that of most humans.
We are not very swankily, we like no bragging.
Norway dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the branch yields is invested for the well-being of future generations in special funds.
When in the years up to the world economic crisis all threw with money around itself, which they did not possess at all, Norway kept its purse firmly locked.
“We in the winter ski to drive so long and in the summer walking go can, are happy we”, say Anna.
“And naturally Rakfisk eat”, add them with unencumbered laughter.
I am located in the snow and place myself for another court on of Rakfisk have I enough.
Such a moose Burger is in any case something else. The juicy meat mundet me.
But on evening again the stinking fish stands on the menu.
The hotel, logiere, is one of several places of event, which a Rakfisk Dinner organizes, with which, in which I, guests for the best - or perhaps the senses of smell at the strongest provocative - fish vote can.
There is a live TV circuit to one with fly dressed show master, which is surrounded with Rakfisk by plates.
The spectacle resembles the euro vision the song Contest.
“Which score have you there above in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?”
“Here our points are, Havard”.
One applauds and laughs.
A man falls overwhelmed by its chair, possibly from the Aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict vapor of the whole fish nevertheless.
