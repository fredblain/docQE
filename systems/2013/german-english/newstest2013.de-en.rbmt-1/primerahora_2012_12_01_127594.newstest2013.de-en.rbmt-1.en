Beginning the course, which studies the “end of the world”
The students apocalyptic topics e.g. examine each week like the nuclear war, zombie, virus and germs and the global heating up.
Each term, if the religion professor decided to hold a course over the end of the world he knew that he had an irresistible fishhook: the end “counting backwards” the Maya calendar is enough on 21 December, from which many humans believed that it means the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea, which should expect him into following both months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some “Deudarmaggedon” it called as well as an increasing conflict under participation of Israel, which place, from which the Christian theoreticians believe that the Apocalypse begins.
“I do not have noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste term, it ever gave” said to Charmé this week the student at the University of Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes, what happened today in the world, as if we would be distant thirty days from it, would be this a really good period.
And it reminds of the fact that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And it is not an only professor, this term, which should actually be the latter in history, courses over the “end of the world” offers.
In Temple sitting professor Barry Vacker gives the course to “media, culture and the end of the world.”
The students apocalyptic topics e.g. examine each week like the nuclear war, zombie, virus and germs and the global heating up.
“Analyze we, why these ideas spread, said with the time” it, as well as the way, as hypothetical scenarios are offered, which lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material arrives into the hands of terrorists, for example a war could break out.
The students of films with apocalyptic contents analyzed and examined this month, how they let themselves compare in the comparison with the real life.
“I tried to inform the students about it what possible, probably, convincing and impossible is”, said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor for Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a team, educated a sitting professor for history of art and anthropology in order to offer a course with the simple designation “the end of the world”.
“We do not take up 2012, so that we the option to always keep to be able to hold the course again if the world does not go down, said” Restall.
Despite the “forthcoming fall” the students must study, provide projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State the final examination the eve of the Apocalypse is accomplished, why the students do not have other opportunity, than continuing working “up to the night, where the world goes allegedly in the end”, said to Restall.
The courses were much like.
“To two hours there were no more places” said rest universe about its course for students with high average, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before beginning of term we received emails from students, who asked whether still places were free.
The students for their part insure that the course ranks among the most interesting ones.
“It is to be seen fascinatingly, what said the people to do, around itself to comfort”, to Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year old student in Rutgers Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religion mentality is actually only one question of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing for the sick explained all apocalyptic films to have seen.
“Never I heard something of an instruction, where this is informed”, indicated it.
I enjoy it.
But none of the asked students - and less still another professor - explained, to the last date the 21. To believe December.
“Our first project treated the prediction of the Mayas, and in certain way we discredit it”, said Julie Zeglen, Student in the last year in Temple, 21 years old and from west Chester.
The Mayas never forecast the end of the world; it concerns only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
It marks however that in the western society a apocalyptic fear exists, which leads back several centuries, when the people reacted to changes in their environment with the forecast of the end of the world.
The Internet increased these speculations.
“Other place one think the people not in such a way”, say it.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor of the University of La Salle, which informs this year on the Philippines, answers fast to the question whether he would know a course there over the “end of the world”.
“The Philippines take part not in the end the world”, wrote it as suggestion on an exception of a higher instance.
We have a pardon of the Pope.
Rest universe pointed out that about the years many days of the last court it was spoken and said that if on 21 December nothing happens, “the people immediately to a new date thinks” or of it philosophized that 21 December the beginning of a seven-year-old was period, according to which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they would like to go to celebrations over “the end of the world”.
“Perhaps I call a few friends, thus we together to laugh can”, said Samira Ford, a 20-year old student for communications.
