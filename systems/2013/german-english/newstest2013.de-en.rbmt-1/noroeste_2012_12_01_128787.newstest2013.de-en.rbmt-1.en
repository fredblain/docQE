After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a judgement, which does not recognize the restructuring of the commitments of the group of Vitro, which were reached by means of a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent for each national enterprise with addresses in the neighboring country is created, which has payment problems.
One could say thus that the procedures for surviving the enterprises, which permit the Mexican laws in the country the star do not have and Stripes in the contradiction to international agreements validity.
In practice on 15 June the acknowledgment of the judgement which was issued leads by the judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas to the fact that the Mexican enterprises are helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However the resolution opens door and gate for the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, in order to call because of three inconsistencies the highest Court of Justice of the United States.
While the judge of the thing points out that the creditors must be subject to the law of bankruptcy of the United States, says the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit with seat in new Orleans first that it concerns with the main trial the commercial bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first item would mean that the international cooperation in procedures does not admit with inability to pay of enterprises with landspreading profile is.
For this purpose the model law of the United Nations for the standardization of the international trade law was actually created, whereby the American Law institutes was used as mediator.
Secondly the judgement determines that without the voices of the societies after acknowledgment of the commitments in the bankrupt's estate, which the branches of Vitro with their parent company had the necessary majority for the restructuring of the commitments would not have been reached.
However this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
Vitro is not actual the first case, with which this pattern became certified.
There is a half dozen of examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose commitments under enterprises of the group were confirmed by the Instituto federal one de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut for commercial bankruptcy).
It is in addition correct that after departure of the voices of the branches the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained with the courts of the United States against Vitro i.e. the vulture funds like e.g. Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, majority would not have reached.
The vote would have gone out 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not considered by the court of appeal.
On the other hand there is Vitro debt for its difficult situation starting from 2008 in the context of the large economic crisis in the United States, which gave impacts to the country.
For this reason the family inserts González Sada before the same court of appeal contradiction, so that the vote takes place in the plenum, i.e. from all judges, because only three of it co-ordinated.
One does not allow to that, the cerium CIO rare objection is inserted, which demands the examination of the procedure by a higher instance, in this case by the highest Gerichtshof of the United States.
The serious at this case is that the court let a document aside, which was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), where the procedure accomplished by Vitro is described in the context of the law over commercial bankruptcy, and where is pointed out that it had adhered strict to the agreements signed by both countries, in order to correspond to chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
In addition it is pointed out that the country was subjected to the principles of the commission of the United Nations for the international trade, i.e. the fixed rules for the cases of transnational inability to pay, which guarantees the equality of debtor and creditors.
Zweibandige Karambole: an impact for Vitro and for the country.
