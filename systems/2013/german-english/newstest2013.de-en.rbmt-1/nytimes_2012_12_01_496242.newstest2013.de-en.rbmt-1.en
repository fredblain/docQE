In a constantly electrified world it is beautiful to be also times bored
This Thanksgiving spent I unexpectedly five hours in the airport, when our airplane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flier.
I had thus enough time, in order to make for me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not want to lie.
A half day at the airport for a flight to wait, is rather nerve-racking -, if books, magazines and iPhones (and naturally taxfree shopping) are available.
But more and more university graduates and child development experts would start boredom as something positive.
If it goes according to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be occasionally bored.
Thus the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting trains of thought which possibly promotes creativity.
And because most of us nearly constantly stare to other screen nowadays at or, the advantages of the boredom do not benefit us.
Should we welcome the boredom thus with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
Whereupon I return again.
Like many humans also I always assumed boredom is a relatively current phenomenon, which developed with increasing spare time.
But Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and Roman history at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of “boron cathedral: A Lively History” (Yale University press, 2011) does not see that in such a way.
“Actual has the boredom a very long history”, says it.
The house walls of Pompeii makes a fuss latin graffiti over boredom, which decreases to the first century.
And then is there still the question, as we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of the psychology at the University of York in Ontario, according to Canada consists the problem of the fact that boredom in various kinds defined and was discussed.
To long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of approximately 100 persons professor Eastwood and its colleagues came at the conclusion that itself boredom does not let this define as the experience to want to exercise “a satisfying activity however to be able”.
Boredom differs from apathy therefore in such a way that the person is not busy, this however to be would like.
With apathy however give it no urge to do something.
The key experience of the boredom, he says, exists in a “disturbance of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes only slowly”.
Boredom can sound thereby nearly in such a way like depression.
But professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions could stand in connection, sees bored persons the problem in its environment or the world, while depressive persons see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that us is boring, even if we have only difficulties to concentrate us.
In its study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining boron cathedral in term OF Attention” - to German about: “The dormant understanding: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention”, which appeared in September in the technical periodical “Perspectives on Psychological Science”, wise professor Eastwood and its colleagues on an earlier experiment, with which participants listened to a volume, on which a person a magazine article read out.
Some groups heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, which did not have to do anything with contents. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
The persons, who heard the hardly audible television, indicated, to feel more boredom than the two other groups - they did not have problems to concentrate could for this a reason find and attributed their difficulties of the boredom.
If one tries to concentrate on a difficult or arduous task the disturbance of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor for neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If one can divert however a monotonous activity exercised - “as the search for incorrect products on a factory conveyor, music and help, bored not to feel”.
Actually, then he says, knows we now that Herumzappeln and scratching interpret, often as an indication of boredom, these to even fight can, as persons remain physically more attentive.
“Studies showed that children, who may herumhampeln learn more and keep more information than those, which are forced to sitting still”, so professor Fenske.
Us all becomes sometime boring once - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, a particularly fatiguing film.
But some persons bore themselves more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a “scale into the 1980er years to boredom susceptibility”.
On the scale statements are like “many things, which I must do, repeat themselves and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything”.
Researchers found assistance out of such scales that boy becomes more frequently boring than girl, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the University of west Florida - in particular, which concerns the need according to more and a wide variety of external attractions.
But generally teenagers are a rather bracing heap.
In the year 1991 Reed Larson, professor for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment, accomplished with which it contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times on the day with a Pager.
It found out that 32% of the growing up were bored at school and when settling the homework, whereas 23% indicated to be bored if they at school were not.
But only 3% of parents indicated to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he knows not whether the percentage shares rose or sank regarding the boredom.
It is however sure itself that “the youth is felt as particularly boring”, mainly, because children and teenagers do not have large influence on their expiration of everyday life.
Back thus to my origin question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, because in extreme cases it does not lead to it that humans take on extreme physical risks and to gambling or drugs purge, in order it to alleviate - studies showed that.
On the other hand many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is professor Vodanovich, who investigates the topic for more than two decades.
“With the boredom the brain wants to say to one that one should do something else”, so Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not know always, what one should do straight best.
If one is boring and one uses this energy, in order to play and cook guitar, one becomes happy.
But television can provide at short notice for luck feelings, these evaporates on a long-term basis however again.
Who hands thus an iPad to its bored child, it can divert thereby of the boredom. It did not learn however to converse or control, says professor Fenske.
And it adds: “Self-check is passed from a situation to the other one”.
The child does not only learn to converse but receives also within other ranges more self-check.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Also we should not see it too critically.
Instead our goal should consist of probably-feeling us also off the constant activity and technology irrigation.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds, as if would have to be more frequently boring us. But boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire, to do something meaningful”, says it.
He believes that humans in truth look only for a way to switch off and relax.
“In an environment, in which we are constantly over-stimulated, it falls heavily, to be occupied, if the noise grew silent.”
