The most difficult occupation of the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and their health, if they carry 70 Kilos sulfur over the steep, stony ways.
There are humans, for whom their work is hell, and others work word by word in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers, who earn themselves their life, by getting sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Java.
In addition it must rise each day down to the ground of its crater, where sulfurous gas in the contact with air, the leaking out the earth, solidifies itself.
After it knocked out large sulfur stones, which can weigh altogether up to 70 Kilos, it transports them in two bamboo baskets on its shoulders over the sloping paths from stone.
There is only 250 meters up to the point of the volcano, which rises into a height from 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent in the turtle speed, whereby them the balance to keep and carefully must set their steps, so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that each step can cost their life, as this happened to a French tourist, who fell years ago at the steep rock slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 eurocent for each Kilo sulfur, which they reduce.
Arrived above, they clear the way between the tourists, them like circus apes photograph themselves and run with that fatiguing heavy baskets of three kilometers up to the balance, which set up a mine company a little further down on a height of 1850 meters
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which uses the occurrences in the volcano and (never better said) its workers, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocent) since 1960 for each Kilo sulfur.
It sells then for 10,000 rupees each (83 eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in the everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
“There we normally 70 kg carry, receive we for each way approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)”, explain to us Anto, which makes under normal conditions three distances on the day.
For each distance it needs three hours, according to which he is completely creative, in the end the day has got together it however then 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
Which like miserable wages for such an almost inhuman effort looks, is however the three-way of what he would earn with the farm work.
“Daily wages of the mine workers here, where with the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid on the day and the average monthly income amounts to two million rupees (167 euros), are very high”, describe the carrier, which worked before as a bricklayer on the tourist island Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with its family to Banyuwangi, a village in the proximity, and from a reason, which is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: “I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduisten, and I brought them after Java, around them to the Islam to convert”.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and its eyes is attractive because of the poisonous gases.
The 27-year old Anto sets its life at the Kawah Ijen for three years on the play, whose sulfur already left the first traces with it, although it covers its face with a mask and special eyeglasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and its eyes is attractive because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price, which he must pay for reaching his dream.
“I will work here still two years, because I open a shop or”, promises he would like to learn Spanish or French in one more than only acceptable English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but young man punished by the life could work as a tourist leader, waiter or on the receipt of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a carrying donkey.
It divides a dirty cabin with other carriers and rises each morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur leaks out also at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the darkness shines bluish.
The shade provocatively, he rises in the light of a small head lamp at his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
Approximately 400 carriers load themselves at the crater ground the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders.
Despite its large profits the mine company did not mechanize the sulfur dismantling, in order to save costs, and supplies with to the carriers, which work on own bill and are paid after weight, no equipment.
They receive also no portion of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) to addition per camera, which the guards of this nature park as well as the admission fee at a value of 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) require of the tourists, who come to photographing the volcano and the human carrying donkeys.
“This work is for the animals and not for humans” protests to Madrusin, a born, 42 years old carrier, which works three decades since leaving the school on the Kawah Ijen.
It is able to carry as far as 110 kg and insured that he continues, “so long it goes”, because he needs the money for the education of his three children at the age between 10 and 18 years.
I will go not into pension, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and it itches the eyes if the wind suddenly turns and gets jammed the mine workers in the thick columns, which ascend from the crater, the men are so hard that nobody complains about serious diseases… naturally except the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders, which deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on its back Unainik is with its 53 years only more able to carry 50 kg.
Break each day it and its companions 15 tons sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers distance.
“I will go not into pension, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life” explains Unainik, whereby it opens its mouth far, in which some teeth is missing.
From its five children the oldest one works with its 30 years also as sulfur carrier.
The time passes, but the miserableness stops generation on generation in one of the hardest occupations of the world: that, which works as human load donkeys on the Kawah Ijen.
