“PSG is not the FC Barcelona!”
In this season you accepted a new extent with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it by a personal insight, in addition, by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players came.
I make progress daily at its side.
The technical personnel gave me likewise much.
These elements would stimulus me daily to improve my play level.
And with a play is still simpler this.
In the football everything goes very fast.
But I do not break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparing training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my play time with Saint Etienne I made always gradual progress.
They make themselves thus the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti…
The new acquisitions of this summer are accustomed to deliver plays very high levels.
They know also that each training unit is decisive.
This leads to the fact that a player must to be offered as I, the forehead and its best wants to give.
By the way Carlo Ancelotti gives me much regarding my playing position.
It is supported by co-trainers such as Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the correct person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti flößt all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1 there is no comparable person at present, and he ranks among the best coaches of Europe.
It looks on a rich experience back and many titles with respected associations won.
It had contact with large players.
I think that he will win into of Paris further titles.
In January I held an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had recovered straight from an injury series.
The confidence, which it set into me, is likewise an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took the place of the front runner to us.
We lie in wait however in the ambush.
One of our most important goals is the champions League: we qualified ourselves in this way for the round of the last sixteen.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to come as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However we will have our Wörtchen put in a word against very good European crews.
First we want to become first of our group before postage, so that we can deliver the replay of the eighth final as home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
It has already the budget for it…
In order to become a large European association, must of Paris title win and a name on a long-term basis make itself.
This is today not the case.
Financially the PSG gives itself the means, so that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it be a large failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 how this was in the last season the case?
This would be natural a large disappointment.
This year is it to us really because of the heart to cream off this title.
In the last season we were close to.
In May we were disappointed, since we were strong enough, in order to carry the victory off.
We terminated the season with a very strong achievement.
We locked with 79 points.
Normally one should be with 79 points masters…
But another crew, that one of Montpellier, obtained a still better season.
I believe that this year is the correct.
Even if the large crews struggle such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have things to win him.
Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG?
Considering its that and which is players, whom we have, it normally that much of us is expected.
We accept that perfectly.
If we win however with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and one still finds something, what one can accuse us, with security the something is frustrating.
One asks oneself, what the people still expect.
We could never win each weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a play concept.
A crew develops itself with the time.
In the champions League we proved strength.
Regard Manchester town center, an association since two of the seasons do not create yourselves, qualify for the round of the last sixteen too, and which transacted likewise enormous expenditures!
Regarding the invested sums one believed you to the play break with 15 points lead!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship was neglected.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, “were geboostet” by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue is exciting 1.
I hope that we will be in the month May the smiling winner and us to say that we finally won it despite all difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely on the achievements on Zlatan Ibrahimovic dependent.
All the better that one speaks of a “Zlatan dependence”.
That is, that Ibrahimovic is high performance and many gates shoots.
Therefore he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he played, it led before eyes that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the crew we respect both the player and the person.
He respects likewise the persons, who surround him.
Which it carried out, is really unusual.
This spurs the others to improve their play level.
Thiago Silva, who is world-wide one of the best defenders, makes it for all different possible likewise to make progress.
How did you experience the European championships 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was to me because of the heart to participate in this European championship.
Unfortunately my injury prevented me to drive something play time out.
I saw there things, from which I came out strengthened.
Today I succeed in realising good plays in the national team.
This was since my baptism with the “Bleus” my hope.
From what occurred in Ukraine, we drew our teachings, and today we must put an exemplary behavior to the day.
Which opinion do you have to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the point of the “Bleus”?
It achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the WM.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to the victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to employ a comparison.
Blanc had achieved its goal, by having qualified us for the European championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the “Bleus” to Brazil.
On 16 October the standoff forced in Spain (1 places: 1) a prelude play?
This play gave us confidence.
Everyone used itself for all different.
Before this meeting in Spain I did not experience ever a comparable play in my career.
