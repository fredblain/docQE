Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project “Petersburger avant-garde”, which is dedicated to city dwellers, who form the avant-garde of the art and culture.
On the exquisite list already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburger art scene landed, their success beyond the borders of the city go and those acknowledgment into Europe to often find, without in the rest from Russia admit to be.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, who in red dressed bearded one, which one finds times with the Russian museum, times with the summer garden, times with scene meetings or on vernissages.
Where the pictures are always issued by Kirill Miller also, they attract large human being masses.
Kirill Miller is one the typical Petersburger social action-philosophical artist, who creates new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburger avant-garde end of the 80's and/or at the beginning of the 90's.
He is also a man of the city and does magic by his presence on the road its fellow citizens a smile in the face and ensures with them for good mood.
Recently it snatched a turning organ and became the Petersburger turning organ player, there it for this difficult role regarding its artist existence, its philosophy and its image finally ready felt.
- Kirill, why you are actually always in red and not for example in yellow or turquoise in the city on the way?
I selected the color red as fashion designer, which argues with the optics and the image.
In this world red is the compromise between artists, image advisors and society.
In the society everything that deviates something from the grey standard, calls aggressions and bad behavior out.
I want to come however by my provocations with humans into the discussion.
Everyone of my past provocations was an invitation to the discussion.
- When you knew that you must become painters?
- With an exhibition in the cultural palace Newskij, with which my work was issued.
I understood that I must go this way.
Then the time of the old free went, however not officially recognized painters at that time in the end, and new and free painters as I were incomprehensible.
I got used to myself with the painters of the new generation, thus with the representatives of the “Gazonewschina”; from this “Puschkinskaja 10” developed, and then was for a start conclusion.
Me it pulls to the theatre, to mode, to the music, actually to everything, except the literature.
- And all the united itself in your kind hospital… - It was important to me to be located in the center of the Petersburger culture where the best creative artists should meet.
In the year 1995 I occupied an area in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there there was an musical-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburger Boheme up to the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remembers also, how cord with its project “Ucho Van Goga” came there.
Cord and its friends sang simple songs to the Play-back, wore close tricots and to them belonged also the composer Igor Wdowin announced today.
When the group began to play live “Leningrad” became from it.
Traditional costume mountain moderated many programs before the time of “Halli Galli”.
We gave them traditional costume mountain, and it began its large career, but it learned the bases with us.
Also the gallery “D 137” or the club “Griboedov” has its origin in the kind hospital.
There our employees and regular customers went.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture some more meant.
In the year 2000 there was a survey in the press, with which it the honor “personalities of our city” concerned.
I won in the category “artist of the year”, and thus I had arrived at the high point.
It is not easy to work in recent times according to old rules; I am humans of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In the today's time it is simple to become famous but culture and popularity are not the same: One can be famous, without making thereby a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are genuine beads and bring clearly the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts on the expression.
I will have an exhibition with the topic “the Russian museum as clowns”.
Clowns are timeless.
In former times I was social action, but it hurts now and prepares fear to be like that.
In a clown smeared that everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesqueness, and I have grotesque ideas.
We save for example the world, by prescribing that everyone has to disguise itself completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients themselves at the exterior and not at the inside of humans.
But perhaps one may to humans not the hand give, but should him in the face spit.
The deception disappears by disguising.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban turning organ player. - A cultural city should have so a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can be beautiful also commercial art?
- Nowadays commercial art must be carefully, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of the cultures.
In former times humans formed large groups: The Bohemiens loved and the simple people the other one.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please all.
I am not a one hundred-dollar note, which pleases everyone.
Now you must consider yourself, you will please whom.
Now each cult star has approximately 100 supporters.
- Come to the appearances of Stas Michailow however several thousands!
- To him abandoned women come, there play the sexual-social sphere a role.
From cultural reasons 300 persons and 10 not thousand come, therefore there is fewer managements, money, and everything perishes.
I have supporters, and who am most important one, not to destroy it not too would amount to and the reached.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which hung with a collecting tank even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I began with pictures, which come normally only in the end the career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It means: mental culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has at all no culture, that is somewhat completely different one.
I am humans of the past culture and buildup with artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money, in order to be able to paint.
That is the culture, which I endorse.
- Kirill, which is missing to Petersburg?
- Property cultural expert.
One says: Servant of the culture.
But everyone of them cannot be concerned with culture.
With the genuine tsars was it different, because the tsars did not understand perhaps much of culture, but they understood that correct experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are at present good advisors.
In Petersburg we have which, which could be experts, but the way is blocked to them, since it requires hochrangigerer experts, who correctly evaluate the first and for them the way free.
Now only the own taste counts.
The same is valid for the Erarta, however with the difference that they say honestly that they accept not all contemporary art and some painters must look for each other therefore different museums.
- Which is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is more culture and an appropriate fertile soil much.
On our stones art can grow up only with difficulty.
We need a cultural fertile soil, because for example we have meanwhile more writer than readers, and that is not correct nevertheless.
In Europe there are many curious humans, who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us are those much less.
Art must be again modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from subsidies of the city Saint Petersburg
