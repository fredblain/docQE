In the USA nearly Food and supermarket persons employed strike
Each fourth US-American young person sits sometime behind the cash of Mc Donald's
In the past days it came everywhere in the USA to substantial protests against low wages into branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular nearly Food chains like Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still nobody can predict whether the protests will continue to swell still or whether them already soon again air goes out.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing oriented nonprofit organizations.
Apart from the increase of the modest wages of simple Walmart and nearly Food persons employed the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of creating trade unions.
So far this industry of the economy is hardly into a union organized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began past week after Thanksgiving, at the so-called Black Friday, at which in the USA sellouts took place, which attracted millions of customers, which led occasionally to melees.
On this day some Walmart employees, from whom there is world-wide 2.2 million, laid down their work and closed by strike together with trade unions and link activists branches of the chain, whose target audience persons of low and middle income are.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers over hunting rifles and car batteries up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The commodity in the Walmart branches is more favorable on average between 8 and 27% than in large supermarkets.
Therefore many buy the slightly paid Walmart persons employed only on the own job.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest enterprises in the USA.
According to critics Walmart can sell the commodity so favorably often only, because the employees are badly paid.
The latters complain also about heavy conditions of work, for example missing fork-lift trucks or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests in “Black Friday” demanded wage increases and expressed their annoyance over the fact that the contribution for the health insurance in-house of 30 to 100 dollar had risen in the month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns 9.5 US Dollar the hour, can not afford this increase, said her.
Researchers from the California university in Berkeley prove that, if the enterprise increases the average wage to 12 dollars the hour it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
Those are approx. 1.1% more than it now for wages donate.
If Walmart would surround the wage increases completely on the customers, each purchase cost her in the future only to 46 cent more.
Per year would be for it compared with today additional costs of only 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart state contently that it came only into nine Federal States to protests and no losses gave these to the enterprise.
Black Friday took the next day in the evening into its loading from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight, and in this period Walmart sold approximately 5000 articles per second.
Altogether the Walmart cashes at “Black Friday” implemented nearly 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the enterprise, Dan Fogelman, maintained post office in an interview on the web page the left-wing oriented hoof catching tone that altogether “less than five” Walmart employees laid down the work and the protest action “a further PR-trick” of the trade union, which organized the protests had only been.
“Free cash!”
The protests continued to go this week into New York, where their goal however not Walmart branches (in this progressive city desired and therefore nonexistent are not), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants were.
McDonald's says, which sells enterprises billion portions, and nevertheless one does not grant you no sick days, and it paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member New Yorker town councillor
At present the minimum wage is in accordance with federal and New Yorker legislation about 7.25 dollar the hour.
In nearly Food restaurants the minimum wage is gradually raised, however not too strongly, and their simple employees in New York 8.90 US Dollar on the average get the hour.
Less than it nobody earns in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get along in New York with so little money is incomprehensible me.
There was once a time, in which nearly after the school at McDonald's behind the bar, however the young people lived a quarter of all US-American young people still with their parents.
Hardly one saw therein the main source of income or planned to remain longer there.
Now with interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly meet me humans, who deplore themselves that sometimes they must get along with this wages and nourish even their children.
On the other hand there is a comment, whose author marks, in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal it is irresponsible to get children if one does not know, how one is to nourish her.
The participants of the protests, which began in the morning on Thursday at 6.30 o'clock before McDonald's in the 40th Street and in Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks receive a minimum wage from nearly Food restaurants from 15 US Dollar the hour, which corresponds to more than a duplication of the current minimum wage.
They demanded further the formation of trade unions in the nearly Food industry.
The US-American law forbids it to the management standing to this goal in the way and warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand the management does not make it simple for them.
In addition, the establishment of trade unions in the nearly Food industry is difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high labor turnover.
Dissatisfied one
There were loud protests on this day also before many other nearly Food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon before McDonald's at the Times Square, with which some spoke local democrat, among them town councilman Jumaane Williams, which said: “McDonald's says, it sells billion portions, and nevertheless one does not grant you sick days, and it for your honest work are not paid!”
The demonstrators were supported also by other prominent New Yorker democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should support together the nearly Food employees, so that they can receive fair wages and achieve the economic prosperity each New Yorker one earned!”.
According to New York Times this was the largest action of their kind in the history of the US-American nearly Food industry.
However only some hundred humans were locally, by whom by far not all are busy in the nearly Food industry, in which in New York tens of thousands work.
Still it is not to be foreseen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
