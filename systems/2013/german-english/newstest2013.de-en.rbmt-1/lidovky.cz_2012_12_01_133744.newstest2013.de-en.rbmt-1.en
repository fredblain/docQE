The film Argo: If it stands most badly, Hollywood call
In November 1979 a mobilization of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the US-American message in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as a hostage.
For their release they demanded the distribution of the fallen shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution into the USA, which had protected the patronage over decades over its regime.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford it to throw the shah over board since this would have damaged the confidence of her allied ones in other countries substantial.
It was not simultaneous in the situation, in Iran, where the revolution flowed into the installation of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages to implement.
It was a heavy impact for the call of the United States, and the following fiasco with the attempt by force of the freeing of hostages made only worse all.
The imprisoned taken diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations had been obtained by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused at home a wave of the solidarity as well as anti-Iranian tendencies.
The debacle in Iran contributed substantially to the defeat Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan with the presidential elections in the year 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, which gave a small partial victory to the USA.
Directly before occupation to six message employees the escape succeeded to the message.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
It succeeded to the CIA in co-operation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; extravagant story helped them for covering their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports camouflaged as members of a film staff, that visited turning places for a science fiction film allegedly in the country.
Combination that of category
Of the expert for “Exfiltration”, Tony Mendez, developed plan made also co-operation Hollywoods necessary.
So that the camouflage became reliable, articles appeared over this film project in technical periodicals, it press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a material office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film relies on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination several film category.
On the one side it is simultaneous in addition, a so-called “Caper Movie”, i.e. the history of a successful piece of Hussar as for example a realistic political thriller, the film Ocean's Eleven.
Thus the tendency levels off change themselves on the one side the documentary scenes from Tehran in the film (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographies are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other side the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and easily exaggerated from there.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA center and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office corridors, at the telephone…
Ben Affleck succeeded to its career with this film a remarkable restart.
From a smiled at actor respectable director became, and also as actors it is now no more the goal of ironical notes.
Argo is not its third feature after the crime film children's game (Gone baby of Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).
It is simultaneous Afflecks first film, which does not play in the native Boston of the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place belonged thereby to the characteristics which took the previous films off of this director from the standard Hollywoods.
Affleck proves this feeling however also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada becomes “played”.
The best scenes of the film play in the roads and show the reconstruction of events, which really took place - the entrance sequence of the storming of the message is in its clarity very impressing, and mediated thereby nevertheless the feeling of confusion and the unpredictability, which enters, if history moves somewhere.
A similar effect obtains Affleck with its team also with fictitious scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action at too many places
The director had to argue also with the fact that history does not offer actually many scenes stretching in the cinematic sense.
With the few he however quite successfully works, whereby sometimes he helps the reality somewhat - which does not work then always so elegantly (the scenes, in which the threatening crisis on the airport is turned away in Tehran from a telephone call in America, or also the pursuit on the runway, work somewhat affectedly).
The weakness of Argo is its all too broad dispersion, which is due to the necessity to have to show too much at action at too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in her roles as Hollywood employees, their figures however more area would have earned, and thus they are not located in the film by far alone.
Afflecks film loses thereby something at traction power. It is a film, which one pursues with certain interest and the organization and to a thriller from the 70. Years reminding Retro style to appreciate knows.
It wakes enthusiasm however only heavily.
As memory of up to today in certain way alive piece of history and as proof its, as covered nevertheless the conceptions of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, it is however sufficient.
