Australian laws for uniform cigarette packing come into force
Health warnings and gotten sick parts of the body on neutral green packings, which are alike for all tobacco marks
Those world-wide first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packing stepped in Australia. With it mark logos and colors are replaced olive green covers, which are printed on with drastic pictures beyond that by neutral, which suffer parts of the body and by cigarette smoke of gotten sick babies and children show.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures once the only difference between the packings exists in the label names starting from coming Saturday, which are printed in identical, small writing.
Thus Australia introduces the world-wide strictest regulations for tobacco packing.
The Australian Federal Government wants to divert young people of smoking, as the glamorous picture of the tobacco consumption is eliminated.
The government of studies goes out, which showed that humans, who did not begin with 26 yet to smoke with 99%-iger probability will not no more begin also thereafter.
“One can see with children of recent age that they understand the message, which tobacco companies with their mark picture try to apply”, so Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies, which showed for example that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia exhibits one of the smallest smoker ratios of the world and the changes will affect only slightly the profits of the multinational companies, other countries consider already similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
Thus it was called, with the laws the black market trade was favoured, which leads to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
“The laws become serious, unintentional consequences lead”, say Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer by far larger quantities of these products on the roads of Australia.
Others however say that the laws set their business in motion.
Sandra Ha von Zico import Pty Ltd., a small exempt private company, marks that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers for the cover of the intolerable packing enormously rose, since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, failed Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago because of the highest Australian Court of Justice with their contestation of the laws.
Zico sold up to 6.000 units to wholesale firms and waits for new existence.
For us that is a good business.
According to experts the hook lies in the popularity of social media at exactly the subpopulation, to which the plan addresses itself.
A number of Australian laws forbade tobacco companies from the TV-advertisement banished, it to them to appear as sport sponsors and most resellers forced not to lay cigarettes out in business longer. Now the tobacco advertisement is changed in the Internet.
The Australian government forbade, possesses Internet advertisement by local enterprises and sides however no influence on international sides.
“Who does not have tobacco marketed and only a small range remaining, in order to apply its products, comes around the Internet around”, says Becky Freeman, Forscherin in the health service at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman determined a rise at empiric reports to marks, which were written by “completely normal people”.
One must place oneself the question: Is that bare a private person, who finds so large favour at Marlboro cigarettes that she takes up for it even a video - or has a marketing agency thereby to do?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry concentrates instead of on marketing to argue with the new laws.
It went even so far, Ukraine, paying Honduras and the Dominican republic in order to contest the new regulations - those countries weight at the world trade organization about unfair commercial restrictions, although none of the countries operates larger trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for center 2013.
According to Plibersek the government discussions with other countries led, which consider similar packing laws.
Canada was 2001 the first country, which prescribed photographic warnings.
Meanwhile these were expanded on more than 40 countries, among them Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers appear stubbornly.
The pictures do not affect me.
I ignore it simply.
“One takes oneself simply a dump and puts the box away”, says Victor El Hage with the purchase of a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly said there is only one reason, why I would stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, Betreiber of the tobacco trade “King OF the pack” in the city center of Sydney, says, the uniform packing made a filling up more difficult of its shelves.
“Early one I used one hour, in order to sort a supply, now need I four”, say Yu.
“The government should have forbidden cigarettes simply completely - then we would have said okay, that were it, we make close”, add he obviously furious.
