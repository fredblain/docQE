A condition with the crowbar in Egypt
This concerns a new poker game of president Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever split regarding the bill of rights, which grants it temporarily the unrestricted authority, it decided to set everything on a map.
For the surprise of all it announced on Wednesday that the condition-giving meeting will adopt its final version on the next day.
Straight ago of one week the head of state had granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work to this plenum.
Egypt relies now for nearly two years on a provisional, several times amended text, which weakens and to a legal disorder leads institutional stability.
This new initiative provided only for a still stronger splitting of the country.
For his opponents the president in its “autocratic delirium” remains, by breaking further “its word” and “the right with feet steps”.
On sides of its proponents one insures that it is a way to terminate the institutional and political crisis as fast as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
Within 14 days a referendum should be held.
To explain a very short period, which forces the brothers to do without their project the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest raves generally speaking country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American newsreel time seems to be convinced of the fact Mohammed Mursi that the Egyptians will vote in a well-meaning manner.
Particularly one places to the Egyptian people with this falling back to a vote an ultimatum over-hurried: “Either you tune for my draft or I keep the unrestricted authority”, the latters should after acceptance of the condition an end take allegedly.
85 to a large extent Islamist members of this condition-giving meeting adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals did not follow the request.
Shortly before the bill of rights November they turned in the middle of away, since they the opinion are that they were not able to emphasize their aspects.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or the civil society acted equally.
For the reaching of the quorum yesterday morning in great haste 11 persons, were added deputy members.
Some are close to the Muslim brothers much.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly unanimously discharged.
The commentators found it by the way entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day came… in time for the prayer to the expression, there some members of the committee of the opinion were that the pendulum clock of the condition-giving meeting did not go exactly.
The text, which was still adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention on itself, remains finally identical to that one for the condition of 1971 and means that “the principles of the sharia are the main source of the right”.
The salafistischen parties, for which the establishment of the Islamic right is an important demand, had to replace hope, “the principles” by “the rules”, which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists the fact that this article was not changed, is a proof for their good will and for their respect opposite the other members of the Egyptian society.
“The liberals, who regard this only as propaganda impact, answer hypocrisy”.
Because according to them the islamisation of the condition is made by other articles.
They have particularly article 220 in the eye, which awards an advisory function to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular regarding the examination of the conformity with the laws of the sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier is disturbing this, since “the persons, who are requested to a statement, were not selected and no democratic legitimacy possess.
One can see herein the first signs of a theocracy”.
In addition the fears of the liberals are fed by the fact that the next rector of this university might be by far less moderate than the current.
“At present no concrete religious commitment is to be recognized.
With this condition we remain in the context of the civil state.
Most lawyers, who worked on this text, are not Ulema, but university graduates, which were trained partially in the French system”, appease Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctorate over the Egyptian Verfassungstransition.
It grants however, “that regarding the article 220 an ambiguity be present can, since the used terms are taken to the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the “Fiqh” [Islamic jurisdiction, note D. Talk.].
And in the future the question could be raised, to what extent civil court judges are competent, on it to decide.”
Apart from its religious aspect the text adopted yesterday is criticized strongly due to the extensive powers, which it grants to the president of the republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are clearly reduced compared to the former regime.
A further point at issue: the powers of the army.
In conformity with the desire of the military the examination of the defense budget is submitted not to the parliament, but a national defence council.
Likewise it will not give prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, how the combinations demanded it for the defense of the human rights.
The latters communicate likewise their fears regarding the text, which they regard as freedom-threatening.
The facts of the blasphemy are maintained, and offenses are now forbidden, what could have serious consequences for the right to free expression of opinion, in particular for the press.
Beyond that no more article refers to the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to their opinion the only positive point is the prohibition of the torture by article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous condition.
While the Egyptian president had to express itself last night on TV, demonstrations for this afternoon are planned.
The proponents of the head of state will deploy Saturday.
