Palliative care - the best way to die… | Le Devoir
With its committee for “dying in” Quebec discussed recently the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be taken up shortly again, although a bill is prepared.
However still much remains doing in this important subject area.
Le Devoir tried to regard this more near.
A few weeks ago Mr. L lived. still alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate gland cancer, which consumed him, had it one eke out from two years left.
“You gave me five years to live, I seven years created”, said it halfheartedly, lying in its bed in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, in which it had the day before arrived.
“However it is always a shock, whereupon one can be preparatory”, says he.
The illness makes its work: immeasurable weakness prevents it to go and even even eat however on the toilet.
At the table before a delicious lunch sitting, consents he resigns to be able to be helped when eating.
Courageously succeeds even smiling it and speak with the strangers, which are busy around him, it its medicines brings, and a bath to him offer.
The courage of usual death.
“My largest desire is it that one means diarrhea heals, there this is humiliating”, communicates it.
A few hours later the team found an elixir for this evil.
“In the course of our life we experience that a man in standing pees, tells” Pierre Brodeur, Psychologe in the home Victor Gadbois.
To the childhood phase to return an unacceptable humiliating is for certain persons.
“He hangs a backward step of the ability of the person”, adds off, determines.
Because in opinion of several persons, who work in the palliative care, large events take place in the midst of these backward steps.
The patients, who are instructed into the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, suffer all from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In this stage they are over-accumulated by the physicians and nurses, who worry about them, no more with so-called “healing” care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, is the worst fear to die “consciously and by asphyxiation”.
But by the illness has I mean children really to know learned.
“I have good children”, add her.
“I have no more desires in the life”, say her, before she accepts that one puts it on a mask, which helps her when breathing.
It expects last visit of its son, who comes from Italy in the next days nevertheless still another.
In the home one offers Victor Gadbois with a group of volunteers hygiene and assistance with food intake.
The palliative care is used if there are no more other possibilities.
In order to arrange a dying more pleasant.
Into Quebec a bed comes for the palliative care on 11.700 inhabitants.
That is very few, if one considers that we will die one day everything.
Here the life under optimum conditions is continued, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the lady doctors of the home.
Both on level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One grants depending upon desire a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi to the dying.
The diabetics do not have to control their blood sugar level any longer.
And death is part of the everyday life.
Last night we served to Mr. X a beer, which died in the course of the night.
This morning its son will drink up the beer to feet of the deceased.
“We help members and patients equally”, report care directress Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor Gadbois is not a day like the other one.
Beside an old man of 93 years, who enjoys and well by its pillows is supported the last one family meeting in the yard, while one knocks against in its honours, dies a young man of 36 years, who is surrounded by its parents, its wife and its two small children, on tragic way, after he tried everything, in order to survive.
“For six months are three to five beds always with cancer patients in the age by less than 45 years occupied”, communicate Dr. Christiane Martel concerned.
53% of the patients instructed in the home Victor Gadbois come from its dwelling, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of the entrance to the palliative care
One says the fact that 77% the Canadian do not have an entrance to the palliative care, i.e. to a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, if achieved the latter final stage of its life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, like the home Victor Gadbois and the society for domestic palliative care in the region Montreal more or less exclusively specialize in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this large inadequacy in the health care Quebecs ensures for the fact that several expect in the palliative care specialized physicians of the adoption of a law to the regulation of euthanasia and assisted suicide with doubts.
For the month October is a manifest in the circulation, which was signed by prominent personalities of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in order to state their contradiction to a such initiative.
Dr. according to Christiane Martel is not efficient the health system Quebecs enough, in order to guarantee that are all right to a qualitatively high-quality palliative care, before one accepts, to change over to the euthanasia.
Recently, it says, I a female patient saw, who was 14 days with large pain in provisional accommodation, without one seized measures to its alleviation.
I fear that the patients want to die only, because they do not receive appropriate health care.
And at the same time several oncologists treat their patients despite worst prognoses becamed deeply absorbed up to the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, when them broke a cumbersome chemotherapy off.
When I communicated my oncologist the fact that I will break the treatment off her me answered that she regrets that I give the fight up, told it.
However she had said to me that I in the end was!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients asked, to die, the maintenance personnel to thank that it did not allow this desire, after her pain was alleviated by a team of the palliative care.
It must be said however clearly that the palliative care is not during the pain treatment omnipotently.
After Elsie Monereau, 8% of the patients address Leiterin of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the region Montreal not on a pain treatment.
Completely in the end the life the physicians fall back thus frequently to the terminal sedation, which runs out the patients either sporadically or permanently up to the time of its death.
We cannot do longer in such a way, as if we do not notice this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will have ever more frequently the possibility of falling back to this terminal sedation.
Patients, whose pain is not alleviated, say all the same sentence: “I want to die.”
But that means inevitably, “I do not want that you put me to sleep”, but “I would like that my pain is alleviated”.
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian institutes for health research.
