A cause for dying because of AIDS is today a too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old, when one confirmed the test result: HIV positively.
“It was, as if a bomb hit”, says it over the moment, in which it received the diagnosis, the physician without recognizable success “to weaken tried”.
He hid it before his family.
It decided to worry alone about its illness and began to inform about it; and this with such employment that it straight its 43. Birthday celebrated.
It is without a doubt one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit the hospital of the civil de Guadalajara (HCG), into whom he came to several fights 1994.
Fabrizio lives many doubts, few possibilities of treatment and more Stigmata with the human Immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 90's was with difficulty conceivable, as it gave.
At that time it avoided the director of a hospital of the IMSS to say good-bye “because it into a dead end led.”
At that time AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However still many persons come into the hospital, which know nothing from their illness and with those the virus already damage arranged and their immune system exhausted, and which are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after occurance of first reported cases, “large success meant today that surviving a patient, who takes up the treatment in time, and which surviving the general population is accurately alike”, explained the director/conductor of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, whereby he said that this information had been supported in the April of this year of a respected scientific publication.
The specialist for infections and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commentated that the scientists concluded since the year 2008 that AIDS was no death sentence that however would depend the years of surviving and the quality of life on the degree of the impairment of the immune system of the persons with beginning of the treatment, and that those larger opportunities would have, who are not drug dependent: up to 30 years with a counting of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a counting of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above report that, who HIV positively receives the diagnosis at the age from 25 years in this sense “it can become problem-free 75 years old, means so long it under control stands”, explained this specialist.
In order to be able to arrange this progress correctly, it must be reminded of the fact that the life expectancy of the Mexicans amounts to today on the average 76 years.
Even if the number of deaths were importantly reduced in the past years (in Mexico has itself the number of the persons, who die at AIDS, from 6.678 cases in the year 2007 on 4.862 in the year 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) it reduces), it is nevertheless correct that since the appearance of AIDS 60 percent of the patients seized in the national database died.
However in Jalisco 2011 255 persons died in the year, and up to the month May of this year there is already 187 deaths; however it is insured that there is universal access to the anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why thus still do humans die to it?
- In my opinion the problem is not the entrance to the treatment.
This is my opinion, and like that is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we did not have supply problems with the medicines. The problem is that the persons come in condition progressed far, because they do not know their infection condition, i.e. in very late phases of the illness.
It makes a striking statement: “Nine of ten patients come to us, if they have already an accompanying infection. To be able in order global number of deaths to affect, are earlier diagnoses necessary, why solid recognition test must be offered to all persons, with whom this is necessary.”
This proposal tune the specialists and the official of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida EN Jalisco (Coesida) (national committee to AIDS avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio too, which would drive through its test with a private laboratory let, and this for the only reason, because it had made a friend of it, who was already despite its recent age in the AIDS phase and even the kaposi's sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor) had, which one of the usual complications is.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some it think for hearing that they will die, and would like nothing.
“If I to die must, then rather three times burst”, say one in my case.
The change was for improvement, I nourishes themselves well, drives sport and takes the medicines.
Today its parents know only that it had cancer.
I live a normal life, like every different one also.
“I work, undertake much, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pays attention to my health and those the other person”, counts Fabrizio up, which agreed, its intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to divide, in order to animate with its certification those, which have fear today in the context of the world-wide AIDS day.
They should make the test, if they belong to the risk group. Ever in former times they know, whether they are HIV positive, so much the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, is to learn them, how one can live like all humans responsibly.
Its message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the simple citizen large holes exist, explain Ricardo Salazar, Journalist from Guadalajara, which took care of the thing of the HIV.
And the most important is the prevention.
At the places intended for it “the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in former times it separately delivered, now give it to us packages too with hundred pieces, which is already good, it gives however still humans, who do not have an entrance to a condom”, said it.
Among the risk persons for new infections the young people rank.
“To which do you need those?” if a common mockery question of social workers, orientation personnel in schools, is employee in pharmacies and in the health system, to who young people would not like themselves to expose, the correspondent insured.
It struck forwards to orient this inefficient distribution again; the condoms are to be not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities, which are visited frequently by young people.
Promiscuity is not to be promoted.
The beer and motel are not to be paid to them, as the governor Emilio González answered to the question whether under its administration condoms would be distributed.
“Sexuality does not look so; at the best one it is to bring the condoms to those more near which already exercise, brought a sexual activity” it on the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is national seen at 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and because of 13. Place regarding HIV.
92% of the cases of infection are made by sexual intercourse, 6% by means of the blood and 2% perinatal.
It becomes estimated that 50,000 persons with HIV live, because there are 4 or 5 persons, who do not know it for each registered case.
