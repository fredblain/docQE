In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year old Community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court, which will be legal in this state already soon: The possession some fewer marijuana breaking into and a whistle, with which it smoked these.
According to Orozco were it and some friends on one September day with the car in Lamar the close border to Kansas on the way, when they were stopped.
After the police officer marijuana in the car had found, Orozco for the possession of drugs and drug implements was cited - harmless crimes, which are provided with a punishment of 100 US Dollar in each case - and received a court date.
“We are treated like criminal ones”, so Orozco.
But it is also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the resolution of the state to legalize small amounts marijuana to the own use the answer depends less with hundreds of smaller drug offenses on the law, than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities, which turn around marijuana, are dropped here and in the State of Washington, that approved similar measures, already.
The Police Departments do not pursue adults over 21 years longer for possession in small measure. This is legally permitted, as soon as the new laws step in the next weeks into force.
But state lawyers in the more conservative districts of Colorado announced to further pursue existing marijuana crimes and quote still humans in court.
At the same time several cities co-ordinate to prevent from the suburbs Denvers up to the westerns Mountains on it, new, national licensed marijuana business from the opening in their communities.
“This situation continues to develop so fast that I do not know at all, what will next happen”, says Daniel J. Oates, Polizeichef in Aurora, which lies east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the Federal State Washington scratch themselves helpless at the head.
They wait for a guideline assistance for the facility of a license system for production, production, the selling and the sale of the drug - and have thereby one eke out by 1 December 2013 before eyes.
In Washington is one the opinion that Colorado ahead is in each case most states, which concerns the adjustment of marijuana. There the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then to the self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more strongly adjusted market. The state is suitable from there well for orientation”, says Brian E. Smith, Sprecher of the supervisory authority for liquor in the Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no more place or system can do to serve than in the sense of a rough manual.
“We do not have a genuine precedent, which we can follow”, add he.
Washington the law, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December and forms thereby also the terminal gray area, in which the national license system does not exist yet, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practice questions must be clarified in this time - about, like the national default of a “appropriate entrance” too licensed marijuana with the prohibition by cannabis business in the periphery of 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities to be agreed upon is.
“Nowhere it to be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in cities, in particular in the densely populated area of Seattle”, means Ben Livingston, spokesman for the “center for legally cannabis”, a recently educated research group.
On 21 November Chief Oates sent in Aurora an email to its employees, in which he explained, which public prosecutor would not pursue smaller marijuana crimes with persons over 21 years longer, and that the police “immediately” will aim at no charges for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police will implement further urban defaults for the adjustment of growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers were further pursued.
In Weld County in the north of Colorado represents district public prosecutor Ken Buck a stricter opinion.
After the vote it indicated, its authority cases of marijuana possession further would pursue, mainly, in order to induce consumers to the withdrawal.
Up-to-date 119 persons for the possession of approximately 50 gram must answer for themselves or fewer marijuanas in court, although many were accused also for other crimes.
“Our authority has the obligation to pursue offences with which it concerned, let to point of time of the crime criminal offences” Buck in an explanation to be reported.
The reactions are even at places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalently.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, indicates adults for the possession of small amounts not longer.
District public prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided in addition, to it to let not all pending possession procedures fall.
“I do not believe that I mean time waste to implement the right to it change”, say he.
Although 55% the voter in Colorado supported the measure, it was already from the outset clear that it would not be simple to agree upon the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities from government and juridical system to.
And the contradictory reactions generally speaking state promoted a profound cleavage among local officials regarding the large green experiment to day.
With district state lawyers concern it a “cultural barrier”, say yourself Sean McAllister, an attorney from Denver, which represents standing accused for marijuana crimes in court and locally as a spokesman for the national organization to the reform of marijuana laws acted.
“You spent such a large part of their life to pursue persons for the fact criminally that they cannot accept the legalization yet”, believe it.
When first states, which treat small amounts marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as national typical cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and civil servants prepare for one age of legal sale, they wait at the same time also nervously for instructions of the Federal Government, that wants to treat the sale and the cultivation of marijuana on federal level further as criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice becomes giving way.
Despite several startling arrests of consumers and salespersen of medical marijuana the Federal Government permitted the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to the majority.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor of the Obama government is the opinion that detective no doors will probably enter, in order to seize small amounts of the drugs, will however probably bristle, the legal under the new legislation to bear by the state adjusted marijuana business.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait only at all for the fact that the federal authorities act.
Still before the election day some local local administrations approved moratoriums for new marijuana business, although these could open only in approximately one year.
Last week decided Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month prohibition, which is adopted probably next week.
“We would not like to turn out into a position, with that we someone license and then on federal level before a large problem stand”, thus for Bob Nicholson, member of the town councillor.
Our community was correct against this law change.
We depend on for which the community decided and not after it, for which the state decided.
Still many questions are open.
