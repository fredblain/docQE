“The large and powerful” lead to Moscow: Migranten save money for language
While delegates and civil rights activists discuss, the law over obligatory language tests brings which benefit for Migranten, criminal ones act already with falsified certificates
Come annually 13 million immigrant worker to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is it to make money for the maintenance of the families remained in the homeland.
On 1 December a law came into force, according to which each work migrant a test, which certifies knowledge of the Russian language, must placings.
So far is valid this regulation only for Migranten, which in the service sector, in which local housing industry and in the retail trade want to work.
However the tests are to become future with the time according to federal migration authority for all immigrant workers the obligation.
One not only language test, but also test must in Russian history and the bases of the legislation placing.
Linguistic knowledge must be proven both for the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions are valid only for citizens of countries, official language is Russian in which.
Likewise exceptionally from this law are persons, who received their training certifications and diplomas before the decay of the USSR in the year 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of the rights
The whole of the test places becomes under the auspice of institute for Pushkin for the Russian language, the Russian university of the people friendship, the Muscovite of state university, which sank Petersburger of state university and other Russian universities.
The Migranten knows the tests in all cities placings; in Russia already more than 160 appropriate centers were already opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the delegates of the state Dumas and the federal migration authority.
Civil rights activists however asked the following question before the entry into force of the law in the press several times: What actually brings the whole?
Which changes does the regulation bring to have to show linguistic knowledge both for the Russians and for the immigrant workers?
Above all, spokesmen of the migration authority answer, go it around reducing the number of the forced laborers.
“Many talk now about the protection of the rights about Arbeitsmigranten”, say the director/conductor of the agency of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights must be however already protected against its departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems Migranten without occupation, education, linguistic knowledge and medical investigation encounter.
Sebelew is of it convinced that a future migrant without linguistic knowledge will meet inevitably humans with bad intentions, it under the pretext of assistance into a dark, close barrack puts, where he will slave away with dozens of his sort months without meals and documents to endure and 12 to 14 hours on the day.
Many complaints of our Migranten reach us.
“In the homeland you the one is promised, and with the arrival you are cheated, get their passports decreased and received not the promised wages”, confirm the director/conductor of the head office for workers' migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Do not grumble, boss!
Many citizens of the central Asian republics, which want to make their money in Russia, admit nevertheless the fact that they do not know not only the language of the country of destination but also in their own language to hardly in writing express itself can.
That is natural not so much their debt, as rather the evil: Only few Turkmens, Uzbek and Tajik can afford only a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money, in order to nourish the children, let alone, them decent clothes to buy shoes and school things.
As teenagers these children take then immediately the first opportunity to the money making.
“It is difficult without linguistic knowledge”, admits it.
“You feel degraded and inferior.”
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect concerning the law.
The test must only Migranten with legal status placing.
If you do not have this status, then there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile the majority of the immigrant workers is further illegaly in Russia.
“Cordial welcome” or “admission for unauthorized ones forbade”
Many Migranten confirm that it is not simple, in Russia an official status to receive.
The reason are natural bureaucratic hurdles and the linguistic difficulties.
In addition the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
One can make a falsified registration fast and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are not registered to a large extent falsified and we, and from this develop then cases of extortion.
“You want in or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea”, express yourselves the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow opposite journalists.
“Bare costs of wrong papers are not afraid”
Already on the day, on which the law stepped into force, it turned out that the registration documents of the Migranten cannot only be falsified.
Some falsified certificates, which certify completing the language test, were already fitting-taken by employees of the federal migration authority.
The falsified papers were printed with a usual color printer.
Naturally the new owners did not receive these in vain: Each migrant, which hoped, to be able to save so the tests paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
That is more than twice as much like the costs of the official test: This costs a Arbeitsmigranten three thousand roubles.
Over the fact that the most important direct task consists of protecting the system against corruption so that the certificates cannot be simply bought is both office-holders and civil rights activists unite.
For the moment the authorities immigrant workers, who fall with the first time by the test, can promise only that they receive time for a language basic course.
Beyond that places within ranges are offered to newcomers without linguistic knowledge, within which no active communication with humans is necessary.
