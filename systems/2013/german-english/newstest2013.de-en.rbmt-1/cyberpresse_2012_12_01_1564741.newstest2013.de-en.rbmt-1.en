Prostate gland cancer early recognition: should the test be made or not?
The PSA test wise indeed sometimes incorrect results up, with wrong negative or in addition, wrong positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interferences.
This leads to stronger hesitating of the already undetermined men for the execution of early recognition tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We caught up the opinion of two specialists.
Existed with the studies accomplished in the USA numerous interference factors between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference exists with the number of deaths of patients with and without early recognition.
This study likewise showed that with a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years the probability of the formation of metastases is higher around 30 to 40%, if no early recognition were accomplished.
Therefore I recommend the test starting from an age of 50 years and/or 40 years, if one has direct relatives, which was gotten sick with prostate gland cancer already.
With men afro American origin exists likewise a higher risk.
The most important is to make the correct decision as soon as a cancer condition was recognized.
There are kinds of cancer, which aggressively and others, which are indolent.
For the patient the extent of the risk of its cancer condition must be really understandably made, as the possible options are pointed out to it, with which prostate gland cancers remain untreated can, if it does not impair the quality of life in the long run, and one decides in these cases rather for an active monitoring of the illness.
Today no treatment takes place at many men, with whom one recognized cancer, since its cancer is not aggressive and represents no threat for their life.
One proposes an active monitoring and offers to them when progressing the illness a treatment.
One determines the criteria with increasing accuracy for a decision, who should be treated and who not.
Therefore I recommend nevertheless the execution of the test.
Most importantly it is however to speak with its physician in order to determine whether it should be accomplished or not.
In co-operation with the international society for urology Movember developed an instrument, with which it is possible to evaluate the pro and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent the illness
Unfortunately there is no miracle drug for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research the acceptance of a healthy way of life remains the best way, in order to reduce the risk to get sick with it.
It becomes estimated that 30% of the cancer conditions could be prevented, if all would move well to eat and sufficiently.
“If there no more smokers would be the Canadian cancer company, this value to 50% to rise at least”, stresses André Beaulieu, Sprecher.
However is assumed about 10% of the cancer conditions are caused by inheritance.
Several remain also completely unsettled.
For the Canadian cancer company the fight against tobacco dependence a priority, despite the decrease of the number of the smokers remains.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of cancer of the lungs.
It is also a factor of risk for several other kinds of cancer.
It damages strongly the health of humans.
“Today there are still 1.5 millions smokers” in Quebec, regret the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: , The risk at cancer is reduced 10 years after the renouncement of the cigarette to die by half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian cancer company predominance and adiposity promote likewise the outbreak of the illness.
They seem the risk for breast, Grimmdarm, mast intestine, esophagus, to increase pancreas and uterus cancer.
“The research shows that a regular physical activity protects, adds during the entire life from Grimmdarmkrebs” it.
The nutrition
The organization recommends likewise to limit the consumption from red meat to.
In too large quantity it increases the risk to get sick with a Grimm and/or a mast colon cancer.
Sausage goods should be avoided likewise.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic agents.
The “latters can damage and to the development of cancer lead the somatic cells”, explain it.
Vitamins
In the last years several scientists examined the connection between vitamin additives and cancer.
Their investigations are not however at present conclusive.
After the Canadian cancer company the studies are contradictory to vitamin E.
While a study found the decrease out of the risk of prostate gland cancer, another showed rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was not pointed out clearly likewise yet.
Beyond that Mr. Beaulieu stresses, as important it is to speak with its physician about its doubts and its family preloading.
“The execution an early recognition test does not lead to cancer.”
