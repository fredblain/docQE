A republican strategy, in order to advance toward the re-election of Obama
The executive personnel of the republicans justifies their politics with the necessity to fight the electoral fraud.
However Brennan Center the latter holds for a myth, by affirming that the electoral fraud is rarer in the USA than the number of humans killed by the thunderbolt.
The attorneys of the republicans by the way registered only 300 cases of electoral fraud in 10 years in the USA.
One are safe: these new regulations will affect the election turnout negatively.
In this sense these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Contrary to Canada the US Federal States are responsible for the execution of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense the majority of the American governments announced new laws, which make the procedure more difficult for the registration or the going to the polls since 2009.
This phenomenon won after the elections from November 2010 at meaning, with which 675 new republican representatives in 26 states could be registered.
Consequently 180 bills were introduced alone in the year 2011, which limit the practice of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require that the voters submit a photo document of identification and a proof of the U.S. state citizenry.
Beyond that by these laws the periods for the premature casting of votes are likewise shortened, which rescind right to register itself at the election day as voters and citizens the right to vote agreed upon, for whom a court record is present.
Before the elections of 2006 no U.S. state required of the voters to present a photo document of identification.
Indiana was the first Federal State, which raised a such demand.
The highest Gerichtshof of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in the year 2008.
The republican authorities hurried to expand this practice since other states.
In the course of the last two years they promoted bills to 34 Federal States, with which the voters are forced to present a photo document of identification.
It is important to mark that the US-citizens do not order contrary to Quebec over a universal badge like the health insurance map.
Indeed 11% the US-citizen, i.e. 21 million do not possess persons entitled to vote of a government authority of their state an issued photo document of identification.
Beyond that do not have five million new voter in the year 2012 a such document of identification.
However frequently more than hundreds dollar are to be paid, in order to receive the necessary document of identification.
By the new restrictions are disproportionately strongly concerned recent humans, minorities and humans with low income.
Indeed 25% the Afro American, 15% of the persons with an income of less than $35,000, 18% the citizen 65 years and 20% the voter do not have between 18 and 29 years over the necessary photo document of identification.
This still passes on.
The students, who are not regarded as voters, who deliver their voting increased for democratic candidates, are it in several states permitted to use their photo document of identification issued of their facility.
On the other hand the same states permit it to members of fishing rod or hunt associations, which selects more strongly for the republican side, to use the maps issued by these associations for elections.
2004 ago no Federal State demanded a proof of the nationality for selecting.
Arizona was the first Federal State, which introduced a such demand.
Since have a dozen states of laws discharged 2011, which demand from the voters that they prove their U.S. state citizenry.
These measures aim clearly off to limit the Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, who prefer a democratic party.
Beyond that republican legislators promoted 2011 to eight Federal States of laws, with which the registration was abolished by voters at the election day.
Beyond that you limited the right of individuals and groups to carry out for those voters assistance which would like themselves to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example the campaigns contributed to the voter registration with the general elections 2004 to register approx. 10 millions citizens.
Because by the measures adopted since 2009 the portion of the registration of new voters was reduced 2010 compared with 2006 by 17%.
In addition the republican legislators in five further Federal States adopted laws, which aim at, to shorten the period for the premature casting of votes.
For example were with the general elections 2008 in Florida 33% the voter, which selected in advance, Afro Americans, although they constitute only 13% the voter of the Federal State.
Same is valid for the Hispanic population.
The latter constituted only 11% the voter, but 24% the citizen, who selected in advance.
In contrast to it the white ones, which to 76% the voter represented, made only for 46% the voter out, who selected in advance.
Naturally the democratic legislators and their supporters against-placed themselves energetically to the adoption of laws, which limit the registration of the voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors.
The general attorney of the USA intervened, in order to suspend the most disputed laws.
They could partly limit the damage.
For example only 16 of the 34 Federal States adopted laws, which require a presenting of a photo document of identification.
However the again introduced rules will certainly make the practice more difficult of the right to vote in the year 2012.
The democratic critics prangern the party-political nature of the adopted laws on and see the influence of the results in the states decisive for 2012 in them as a clear goal.
A report of the Brennan Centers of 2011 shows that those states, which adopted these laws constitute 171 of the 270 voices, which are necessary in the elector committee, in order to win the presidency.
It is too early, in order to confirm with certainty that these changes of the legislation at the choice system will have significant effects on the result of the presidential elections in the year 2012.
But one are safe: these new regulations will affect the election turnout negatively.
In this sense these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.
