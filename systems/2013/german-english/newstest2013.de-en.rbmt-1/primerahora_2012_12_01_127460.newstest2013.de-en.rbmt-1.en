Héctor “Hetin” Reyes: “Basketball was my life”
The globetrotter of the basketball, Héctor “Hetin” Reyes, was longer than 60 years connected for the basket haven and the whole world visited.
Few in Puerto Rico have a as large mental collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Before it was bound by an apoplexy in the year 2008 to the wheelchair, Rexes was 6 years long part of this sport, was it as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, authorized persons and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or Präsident of the basketball federation.
“My life I put in the basketball many hats long, even several at the same time, as I president of the BSN, managing director of the national team and a president of the federation in the 90's was”, remembered to Reyes on with a visit of Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he with Isabel, its faithful wife lives for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of its house are decorated nearly all with photos and memories of its long career and testify them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those, which remind of its time with the Vaqueros of the center of the 50's as players to 1982, where it celebrated its 15-year old anniversary as joint manager or a managing director of the club.
“That were my best years, which I had enjoyed at most, because I am part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 it as a managing director, joint manager or coach could be.
Were many fulfilling years, including the five championships successively from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye with a championship 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy with BSN.
Off then took over “Cuco” Ortiz, which was a very good manager”, says Reyes.
I know still that me Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed on the university of Alabama (Birmingham), said: “I have very strong and 2 m a large player.
Would you like it?”
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, who had Puerto Rico ever.
Bartow recommended thereafter the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who let himself nationalize and one of our best throwers was.
I know still, how he said that, if Mincy had made a championship possible for Bayamon gau SSE would provide for a further.
The championship of the Vaqueros with gau SSE was granted to it, but already from a distance, because it stood already for 1988 in highest place of the federation.
At this time it preferred it to enjoy its enforcement and from Mincy in the national team.
I know still, when we won for the first time with the before-olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Afterwards the world championship came 1990, with which we reserved the fourth seat, what bronze have been actually should, if not this Canadian arbitrator had been, who let us repeat the last play course for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the world championship 1990 the best national team, which you saw ever?
It belongs to the best ones, how also that one, which won with the Olympiad 2004 against the Dream team.
My favorite is however the crew of the Pan-American plays 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and to the team of the USA a fight offered, like at that time, when they won against us with the world championship bronze.
At that crew not only Mincy, gau SSE, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz) participated again, but also the young players (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morales, which could not be 1990 because of a knee injury thereby.
Crew, which was not perhaps the best one regarding personalities, with which we won however a gold medal and whom large joy prepared us, was that one of the before-olympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner as replacement for the closed players because of the occurrences on the Pan-American plays in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against each prognosis.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was certainly Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers on level of the international tournaments are impressing.
Nobody in Puerto Rico dominated in such a way on this level like Piculín.
And this, without considering its career in the different leagues, in which it played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the boys the work of Leo Arill pleases me well.
What believe do you is the best, what you reached in the federation?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which covered the BSN at the beginning of the 90's up to 17 crews in one season.
What remains still doing to you?
There are e.g. things, which I would have introduced, like the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce e.g. only in their area play and only in national play-off on crews from other corners the island meet.
Today the children make unnecessarily many journeys and plays.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table-official and arbitrators.
Whereupon I am proud.
What do you make today?
I hear gladly music, see videos of music my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time go I to a basketball play.
And naturally I enjoy the society of my Mrs. Isabel, who always was at my side.
