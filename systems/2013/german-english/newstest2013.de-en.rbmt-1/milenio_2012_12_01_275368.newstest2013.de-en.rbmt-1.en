“South America must learn with the integration of the citizens”, says Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality is a goal, whereby “South America can actually learn something from Europe.”
Correa, which in the 6th summit of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) participated, which took place in Lima, explained to the national television in Peru the fact that the Europeans killed themselves “in the Second World War and in other arguments” and “today practically a native country is.”
In this sense it defended the project to create a South American nationality which the member states of the Unasur advance.
“To be reached the free traffic of the citizens and workers in all South American countries must, how this is already in the Andes community the case; there is however still reactionary sectors, which aim at, warned a return into the past” it.
In addition president Ecuadors endorsed the reorganization of the organization of American States of (OEA) under the default to reduce the influence of the anglo-saxon states and consider those, which signed the agreement of San José over human rights.
Those, which teach, never commit themselves to something, and in response to it we always sign the south Americans everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the inter+American commission for human rights has its seat in Washington and by the United States is financed”, explained it as allusion on the political asylum, which granted Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa insured the fact that he do not regret this decision, because he did not betray thereby his principles, but followed his “deep democratic values and opinions over human rights”.
It added that it had given at that time “justified assumptions that Assange was not kept to a third country delivered and its procedure.”
In addition he criticized the Swedish law, which had required those of him to submit him on its national territory to a questioning because of an alleged sexual crime while “the Swedish jurisdiction permits this by means of a video conference, over the message of Ecuador in London have been implemented could.”
Correa explained that the danger would exist that the health and the psychological condition of Assange were impaired.
“Since then it in our message is, I with it did not speak, which ambassador has me however informed that he has an easy problem with the lungs, but no serious” said, the head of state of Ecuador.
There is however the danger that he would take physical and psychological damage, because he was imprisoned in a close area and no physical exercises in the free one would drive through can.
“That would impair, added the health of each humans” it.
Correa indicated that the solution for the asylum, which was granted to Assange since the month June in the message of Ecuador in London was the grant of a charter, with which it can travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities Europa's. It underlined that it had given discussions with London, in order to find a solution for the locked up founder from WikiLeaks to.
We do not act with the human rights, this word do not use we for this case, it however constant discussions gave.
“The solution for this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, leads, explained Baltazar Garzón, a set of procedures on different European instances” he.
And “if Great Britain morning this charter granted, is in my opinion settled this.”
And if Sweden Mr. Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or over Skype cross-examined, as it permits and in other cases was made the Swedish jurisdiction, is settled the problem.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm around itself as defenders of freedom of the press and said that what it does not tolerate “those weaken the mediocrity, which is bad intention and the lie the free expression of opinion.”
“The largest enemies of freedom of the press are not the bad and perverted politicians, but bad journalists, who strive for profit and extort, said” he.
In this sense he congratulated himself that Ecuador no more by such journalists is also not controlled “and by the bankers or hegemonic and skewer-civil countries”, and anticipated that it will deepen the revolution with a re-election “, around the way into this right direction to continue.”
Correa supported also the decision to maintain the veto at least against Paraguay in the Unasur up to its next elections whereby it argued the fact that the organism must remain hard “and as legally disguised coup d'etat may allow to no opportunism and none”, because thereby “the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay was destroyed.”
In addition president Ecuadors regards the desire of his Colombian Gegenübers to negotiate Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgement of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which gave preference to the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua the sea-legal borders between both countries as “absolutely entitled.”
At present this judgement is not converted.
This concerns a problem between a south and a Central American state.
Conflicts are unavoidable, them must however in striving for a common way be overcome.
They must be treated comprehensively, so that one can overcome and look them forward.
Likewise he trusted in a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea-borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and meant that “it is correct for Latin America, to call international instances if itself both countries obligate to accept the judgement even if it very hard fails.”
Regarding the possibility that he places himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to reach its third mandate in consequence, it indicated that he sees this possibility “with much optimism and joy, although it falls sometimes also very heavily.”
Correa insured that, if he lost the elections in February 2013 he would withdraw himself from the political life.
Power personally never interested me, but under as unfair circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by political power.
“My political movement had the faith that I was it, this probable victory guaranteed, therefore I must follow this responsibility”, said he.
If I should win, it would be my last period as a president, afterwards I withdraw myself from the public life.
This is valid also, if we lose.
“That is decided”, explained it.
Correa took also on the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba purchase.
I spoke straight with the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He said to me the fact that he traveled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that was expected that it can travel after the election campaign again to Cuba.
“, He commentated it meant in no case a relapse in the state of health of president Chávez”.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the 6th summit of the heads of state and government of the union of South American nations (Unasur), which was terminated with the call to a higher regional integration, in order for a lasting progress, equality and a security to provide.
