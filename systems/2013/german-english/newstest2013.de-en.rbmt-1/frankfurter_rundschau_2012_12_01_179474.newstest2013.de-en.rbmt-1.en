Messenger: NASA discovers ice on that Mercury
The probe Messenger found proofs for the fact that there is Mercury ice on the planet.
The ice cover should be meters thick possibly up to 20.
The US space agency NASA proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is appropriate for the sun next, there is water frozen also there, how from three on Thursday comes out studies published in the specialist journal “Science”.
The probe Messenger found proofs for the fact that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet lying permanently in the shade.
This should be meters thick at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20.
The water came probably from comet or possibly also asteroids, which are hit on that Mercury.
Nobody brings the find of ice however with the existence of lives on the planet in connection, said the chief scientist to the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on that Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The finds could help however thereby clarify how water and other components of the life arrived into other areas of the solar system.
By the earth citizens are about unnoticed probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to investigate the depths of the universe.
Occasionally they send pictures to the earth: Small peepholes into infinite widths.
The picture comes from a camera, which German researchers of the Max Planck Institute developed.
The eight planets of our solar system, in addition the dwarf planet of cerium.
As Pluto, which circles behind Neptune around the sun, is not cerium after the new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006 a “planet”.
This image detail of an infrared photograph of the pencil sharpener telescope shows a “family portrait” of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars are to be recognized as blue points, more with difficulty to identify are the pink-colored “newborn children” in the star circle hall.
This asterisking screen end region - mentioned by scientists unromantic W5 - discovered the telescope pencil sharpener in the star picture Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This shimmering glow of a dying star took up the pencil sharpener telescope of NASA.
The Donut förmige ring consists of material, which the star during the dying process hurled out.
In the enormous Trifid fog, 5400 light-years remotely from the earth, develop from gas and dust new stars.
The pencil sharpener telescope of NASA shot this photo of the galactic birth room.
The pleiad star cluster, “the seven sisters”, be seen at night can be also called with the naked eye.
With the telescope however the colors become effective better.
Like a red Age the Helix fog looks against to the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is 700 light-years remotely in the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity with a terrestrial continent brought in the title North America for this fog.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides for the spectacular colour.
This baby star could be taken up in its full beauty only by the infrared detectors of the pencil sharpener telescope.
Saturn and its rings: As these developed, is one of the large mysteries of the astronomy.
Possibly they are the remnants of a Saturn moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs of the Hubble telescope: The whirlpool galaxy
Depending upon colour photographs from spiral galaxies to true works of art become.
The admission published by the European south observatory shows the several thousand light-years distant Trifid fog in the constellation contactor.
The name Trifid comes from latin word trifidus (three-divided, three-split), there dark dust strips the glowing heart of the star birth place three-divides.
In the constellation queue carriers photographed astronomer the harbingers of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from the earth remotely race the cores of two merging galaxies one on the other too and will inevitably with one another collide.
This star birth noted the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Whom technical abbreviations are not appropriate, which may call it with her nickname southern Catherine wheel.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a cutout from the iris fog in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years consists distant nebulas of dust grains, which are smaller ten to hundreds times than usual house dust.
This picture was joined from optical and radiographs of different telescopes.
It shows a ring remotely from black holes, 430 million light-years from the earth.
This group mentioned by galaxies, Arp 273, took up the space telescope Hubble for NASA.
Scientists UGC call the larger spiral galaxy 1810.
In this star fog is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle produces always new Youngster.
Also this star cloud, connected with the rosette fog, brings constantly new baby stars out - 5000 light-years from the earth removes.
In this brightly radiating galaxy with a hole still no dust, but only gas exists to little black dresses.
Researchers assume that it developed only shortly after the Big Bang, when in the universe predominantly hydrogen was to be found.
Our insights of the universe: The most important telescopes
The telescope is to have been invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - before Galileo Galilei used it one year later for star observation.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became ever more largely - and the insights, which supply them, ever more deeply.
30 years long, i.e. from 1947 to 1975, the resounding telescope was in the Palomar observatory close San Diego the largest telescope of the world.
Der Spiegel, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It permits views in the universe equal over two mirrors, everyone with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner feelings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Kanareninsel La Palma are enormous - alone the mirror comes on 10.4 meters in the diameter.
Der Spiegel of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - around costs to save.
Nevertheless it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable building method: The telescope is fastened in its elevation angle - and thus its mobility limits.
Also the hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its characteristic: the high light collecting strength.
This reaches up - despite comparatively small mirror diameter - to those of the world-wide largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researcher hears the universe after extraterrestial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the “search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI) can help each owner of computer, by making computing power available.
View of the observatory of the European observatory (ESO) into the Chilean Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope stands - which makes for its name all honour.
With its altogether four mirrors can the telescope also the middle infrared spectrum illuminate.
Likewise on the Chilean ESO observatory the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its main mirror is to be covered full 42 meters - and be set from scarcely 1000 mirror elements together.
On pictures however at the earliest 2018 are to be counted.
To 2007 the two saucy telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were valid as the largest world.
They offer equivalent two mirrors with one average each of ten meters.
The saucy telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which looks beside them still with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF into the sky.
Also on the Mauna Kea is a new, enormous telescope develop - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However the space telescope Hubble supplies the most important impressions from the universe.
Since 24 April 1990 it already supplies pictures of far worlds.
Since March 2009 looks for the space telescope Kepler for extra-solar planets - main for such, which are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 by NASA it was announced that 1235 planet candidates were determined since beginning of mission.
In the picture the last start preparations at the space telescope documented Kepler.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot at the earliest 2018 on board a Ariane5-Rakete in the universe.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to look for light of the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume also at the South Pole Mercury the ice exists.
However there are for it no reliable data since Messenger far more near at the north pole around the planet circles.
Radar measurements pointed for decades after that there is Mercury on the ice.
By the 2004 started Messenger probe - which circles first, those around Mercury - the scientists have now certainty.
