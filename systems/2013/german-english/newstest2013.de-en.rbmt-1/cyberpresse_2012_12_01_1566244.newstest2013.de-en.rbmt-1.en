The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson excited certain attention in the last summer, and this for good reason.
One believes indeed that this boson is less than involved in the mechanism to nothing, which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally it concerns the last particle, whose existence was forecast by the standard model - our best or “to few wrong” explanation of nature and the behavior of the subject -, but was not observed empirically yet.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely sure that it really concerns the Higgs.
We know without the shade of a doubt that we have a genuine new particle, and that it resembles the Higgs boson forecast by the standard model strongly.
Beyond that this seems to be confirmed by new data, which were presented this week on a large congress of physics in Kyoto, but still data are missing, in order to be perfectly safe over it.
We assume nevertheless it actually concerns the Higgs, since apparently only a small risk exists to be mistaken and looks at we us, which it concerns.
There is an inevitably inevitable law, which causes in this world that two objects can be not at the same time present at the same place.
It is not possible to offend against this rule - and tries you it not too strongly, since you will hurt yourselves.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for it a such law is likewise valid: the Pauli' exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy same area at the same time, if they are in the same “quantum state”, whereby this “condition” consists on the whole of some their characteristics.
Outgoing of it the physicists divide the particles in two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called fermion and well-behaved the pauli principle to obey.
And in the other one move the bosons, a bad gang of anarchists, which nothing holy actual in any case not this principle, which means that they can be indeed at the same time at the same place.
These bosons subdivide themselves in accordance with the web page The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboren (those is absolutely amazing by the way) in two groups: the Mesonen, which we will not treat here and which “strength particles”, by which the large forces of nature spread and would be somehow related to those the Higgs boson.
It must be stressed here however that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures, as one could mean.
If you are able to read this chronicle then only owing to a boson of unusual banality: the photon or the “light particle”, which is the “messenger” of the electromagnetic strength.
If a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field “is disturbed” exactly at this place, in approximately like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
From this “disturbance” an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation etc.) results, and this wave is nothing else as a photon and thus a one of the bosons “carriers of the strength”.
More stable field
Same is valid for the Higgs boson, with which difference that another field, which must become “disturbed” Higgs field, so that this boson shows up.
However the Higgs field is very many more stable than the electromagnetic field; the exciter must achieve very high energies, a little comparably with a frozen pond, whose surface could be zerfurcht only by a very large rock.
Therefore an enormous particle accelerator is necessary like the CERN - the Large hadron Collider is a ring with an extent of 27 km! - to reach around such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful, in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There is indeed not all particles and not all materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but for example a sheet paper would never hold other non automatically at the refrigerator.
And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those, which do it, possess a mass, while other (like by the way the photon) possess no mass.
For what all these research can be “good” now, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For the science they serve the examination of the standard model (SM), and it make possible for the physicists likewise to exactly examine all deviations between the observations and the forecasts of the SM.
There are by the way numerous physicists, who hope keenest the fact that such deviations are found since the smallest difference to a “new physics” opens a door and could some holes of the model plug.
One must say that the latter exhibits still large lack, since it does not offer an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which form approx. 80% of the subject of the universe (again ups!).
However with the CERN such deviations were not found up to now.
Effects
The effects of these research for the population of general are more difficult to predict, but it would be to be accepted wrongly that there would be none.
By the way: in the early 60's the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not assume that their work would cause a such revolution.
They continued to see scientific applications nothing else, but.
Indeed us the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked into the Bell lab, has in whom the laser into the 1960er years was invented, and which developed 1962 even the first continuous beam laser (first were pulsed) - already said that the laser was regarded at the beginning rather as a “laboratory plaything”.
Place yourselves forwards…
In addition applications can result also from all the instruments, which surround the research.
For example again Willard Boyle developed 1969 during his work in the optics a small photosensor.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor serves today all digital cameras world-wide as “eye” and for it 2009 the Nobel Prize for physics brought in.
Naturally this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change inevitably our life, but it means that one can really never know it…
