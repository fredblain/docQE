World AIDS day: Stamp, sing, help
In Heidelberg the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are pleased about it.
The history of a connection, which overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First is there stamping: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, lady pumps and gentleman slip by look for the beat on the parquet flooring, find it fast.
Unity two three four.
Only then the voices of the singers swell slowly to on alto, bass, tenor and treble - press, beguile and pursue themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year old conductor, lifts it nearly from its material shoes, if he unites her with his supply wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music area of the institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg rehearses the choir Imbongi a new song.
To the fifty singers and singer came, between 23 and 69 years old, of the Humangenetikerin up to Hausmann.
“Om'Obani” is not a simple piece, each choir voice has another text and this also still in a very foreign language: Zulu, who is spoken of eleven millions of people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help to the self-help
World-wide there is approximately 34 million an HIV infecting, estimates Unaids, the program of the United Nations for the Bekämfung of AIDS.
23.5 millions of people of it lives in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 percent of the population are in the meantime HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village Esitjeni found the association Voices for Africa godfather in Germany.
70 of them visits a resuming school.
For 15 or 20 euros in the month one can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a hot meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means on Zulu Geschichtenerzähler or also Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language to speak flowing cannot sing anybody in this area, but.
For nearly ten years the choir learns songs in this foreign soft language and returns it there now and then also where they originally come: into the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers beeline from Heidelberg remotely, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there are the village Esitjeni, which depends on the voting force of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
There about 2000 humans live, some still in simple loam and straw huts, a majority of it are children.
More than 300 of them has no more parents, because these succumbed to the HIV.
To Esitjeni it points itself in the small one that Swaziland suffers completely: highest HIV Infektionsrate, lowest life expectancy world-wide according to Unicef.
Cutting the male foreskin, which reduce the infection risk as can be prove by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
The immunodeficiency virus in itself, with center thirty to die is no more rarity carries than forty percent of humans in Swaziland.
With a common African journey in the spring 2005 the choir discovered the village, above all however saw the Imbongis many children on the roads, which it did not only lack parental welfare service, but simply at everything: Meal, clothes, education.
Without graduation one has no opportunity in a poor country more than ever.
At first it was still the private commitment of particulars to make possible for a few euro in the year a child to the school to fancy and it a hot meal on the day.
But already one year later created the choir the association “Voices for Africa”, which worries since then nearly professionally about the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts to sexual transferable infections
What are the most important sexual transferable diseases?
Among the bacterial STI syphilis, chlamydia rank and trip by (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI is HIV, human Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main concerning groups?
Syphilis and trip by occur particularly with men, the sex with men have.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes at least four cases of syphilis announced of five all in Germany will transfer by sexual contacts between men.
With the heterosexual adults chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (mushroom) are, trip by and human Pappilomaviren frequently occurring sexual transferable diseases.
The spreading from HIV is among heterosexual adults in this country comparatively small - nevertheless: Are allotted to approximately 20 percent of the HIV new infections to this group.
Among young people chlamydia infections arise substantially more frequently than at other subpopulations.
After European collections three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years.
In this country occur besides human Pappilomaviren with young people frequently.
How did the number of the infections develop?
Not all sexual transferable diseases are compulsorily notifiable.
The number of the syphilis infections doubled itself according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 illnesses in the year 2001 on 3698 illnesses in the year 2011 more than.
The number of the HIV new infections decreases since 2007.

That is for instance a tenth less than in the year before.
Which symptoms refer to a sex illness?
The infections can cause ulcers within the genital range, complaints with urinating, discharge, hypogastric region pain as well as vesicles or warts.
Often they cause however no pain or other symptoms and remain therefore unnoticed.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of an infection, offer however no hundred percent protection.
Because partially exciters of sexual transferable diseases can also by lubrication infections and confine body contact to be passed on.
Therefore experts recommend regular investigations particularly with frequently changing sex partners.
Early made a diagnosis most STI can be healed and long-term consequences be avoided.
By sponsorships, donations and not least the fees, which the choir in all of Germany ersingt itself, some meets.
“Altogether we sent, say already approximately 200,000 euros after Esitjeni” Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village administers Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and enforcement-strong Mrs., the funds from Germany.
It worries also about it that the orphans find accomodation well, with one of the grandmothers about.
The Gogos, how one calls the old women on Zulu, is the supports of the village.
Some of them took up up to 14 orphans with itself, give them a roof over the head and ensure for the fact that the children in their uniforms appear punctual to each day to the school teaching.
Who does not have anybody more, comes into the protection house to Khanyisile, a single woman, which is paid exactly the same by the association like the two cooks, who cook each day for more than 200 hungry children.
Besides “Voices brought for Africa” a sewing school into being, built and together with the American health organization psi it organizes two chicken houses that many let a HIV test make in the village.
That is not matter of course, because the illness generally speaking country is also so obvious, one is silent it most of all dead.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo”, says Annette Lennartz, “because it with sexuality to do has.”
Actually strangely in a country, in which the king holds itself officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Mswati III., is well-known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things it also this by the state sanctioned way of life is owed that the HIV spread in the past decades so fast.
In addition, the many migratory workers, who carry the virus by the country.
Free condoms there would be at each corner, say Annette Lennartz, “however those is hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh tons flesh.”
In order to promote the cultural exchange something, the Imbongi choir travels every two, three years together by the south of Africa and sings songs full nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many at the southern corner of the black continent still from times of apartheids.
A bus of full white, which sing songs in a black language - so much acknowledgment brings not only tendency and joy, but already from some furious border soldiers a few tears wrested.
The journey leads always also after Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godfather children.
Even if one hardly finds the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river is it more to be familiar.
“The light” goes says there humans to Esitjeni, there is.
And if one returns the 8733 kilometers of beeline to Heidelberg, to the ramming singers into the training room at the Bergheimer road, then one sees it shining also there.
