With Bitcoin paying and selling without bank are possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and handling charges between the involved ones.
Beyond that is like so often in these technologies a political vision seizable: the conviction that arranged current, from bank monopolies monetary system, to financial crises leads.
Indeed the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (an alias) is both a virtual currency (but in dollar, euro etc. convertable) and minutes for the safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which facilitates the direct exchange of files.
With 15.000 computers in the network already about 200,000 transactions were seized.
Some thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as donation or as currencies.
After the course of Bitcoin had reached a highest level of 30 dollar (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell five months later on 2 dollar, before he recovered today on approximately ten dollar (the courses are specified on the web page bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressing in the comparison to the world trade of material currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless the European central bank (EZB) showed published report in one in October over virtual currencies interest for this.
It describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with largest success”, “in the competition with the dollar or euro” and “similarly the conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies like the “Credits”, which are used, in order to advance in a video game, which one wins through plays or buy (and sometimes also back-exchange) can.
The social network Facebook likewise developed a such system.
However the trade each mark is controlled and worked on by a central authority.
With Bitcoin all nodes are simultaneous keepers of the invoice book, examiner, money emitter as well as buyer and salesperson.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two email addresses in form of an email.
With the difference that the user for each payment can select another address, which guarantees anonymity.
A number of the data standing with this transaction in connection is signed electronically by a double encoding system.
In this way the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Assistance of contents of the file is likewise possible it to guarantee that the acted Bitcoins is present in the invoice book of the public accounts spread in the entire network.
The crucial step consists of registering this new transaction into this book.
This takes place over a mathematical task, which on the computers is started, whereby the winner, who is a kind provisional central banker, possesses the privilege, this additional line to add.
This concerns carving the file up, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers “take” the new transaction and add it a number, before the whole becomes “hacked”.
The goal is it to find that number which shows a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number were found, the other knots can check easy whether it is the correct.
The transaction is thus permanently linked with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to two times amounted to very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay want, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other one remains without link, since both different fingerprints possess.
The computer, which solved the task, receives 50 Bitcoins.
For the prevention of an inflation this reward is regularly halved, probably before at the end of 2012.
In the circulation Bitcoins present is thus on 21 million limited, but up to a one hundred millionth divisibly, which leaves a certain clearance…
Beyond that the difficulty of the task with each improvement of the computing power is increased.
The life of the network already had heights and depths.
The web pages, which services for Bitcoin make available, were attacked and the Bitcoin inserts were stolen.
“The used flaw concerns not actual minutes”, insures Pierre Noizat, who introduced straight Paymium, which is an enterprise for the payment with genuine money and which uses network Bitcoin.
The EZB reports also on the possibilities of the money laundering assistance of this anonymous service.
However cash exhibits this lack likewise.
Important participants such as Wikipedia refuse donations of these art.
By others like the blog platform WordPress are accepted it.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann institute analyzed the invoice book in Israel and showed that nearly 80% are not the Bitcoins in the circulation.
In November a “megasale” was started.
“Thirty thousand dollar were exchanged”, are pleased Jon Holmquist, which works for the enterprise Coinabul, which converts Bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is likewise an author of a book concerning this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with genuine money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses however Bitcoin for the validation of the transactions, which are cheaper thereby.
Beyond that the owner administers his identity and can remain thus anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the resellers, and the latters do not have to install new terminals or computer programmes.
They must indicate simply only one address, which of a telephone “photographed and recognized” it can become indicate Pierre Noizat, who insures that he has thousands users.
A general trend is to be registered, with which hierarchical systems are considered in favor of more strongly horizontal aligned systems.
“It will last some time, until Bitcoin succeeds, but 2013 could be a turning point”, prognosticate it.
The EZB sees the different in its report by the way forwards, to evaluate today as highly regarded risks in case of a success of this currency again.
