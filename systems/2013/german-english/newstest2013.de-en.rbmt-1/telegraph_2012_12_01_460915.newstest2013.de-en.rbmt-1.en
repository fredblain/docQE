Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford, because I am Tory
University students today are not only attacked for their opinions
It had always been my largest dream to receive a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I regarded once as the largest knowledge temple of the world, for modern Greek symposium, which promoted the large columns of the civilization - free thinking and tolerance -.
But within two weeks after my introduction in the Worscester college end of the eighties - there I had intended to study history - I had packed again my suit-cases and had caused so the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening standard was called it, I would have gone, because I would have had a problem thereby that fellow students in the neighbouring room had sex.
The author A N Wilson explained mischievously, I would have left the university, because I was compelling to drink from damaged cups.
The truth however was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not due to my quite unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
One had chicaned me only for a reason - a reason, which seemed in this alleged cradle of the enlightenment all the more narrow-minded and crueler: Mine meanwhile the deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important advisor Margaret Thatchers and I proponent the conservative of the party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to current reports a new generation suffers rights under similar pursuit, moderate by students.
The organized and rising hate on Tory students in Oxford developed meanwhile such dimensions the fact that a group of them demanded last week the same equal rights protection, which obstructed gays, and ethnic minorities benefits.
Conservative members of Junior Common Room (JCR) of the corpus Christi College indicate, them due to their political views “are isolated often actively, personally attacked and for unwanted explained”.
They demand a place in the equal rights committee their college, in order to guarantee that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was aggravated by a recently radiated documentation over political students on BBC Two, “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the right”, which represented Tories as Exzentriker and a neo-Nazi.
In it was shown among other things graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student combination of the University of Oxford, which drove in a Rolls-Royce and with silver suit and showed off to silver-occupied going stick.
At other universities say conservative students, it than “scapegoats for the introduction of higher study fees” are regarded.
20-year old Luke Black, Vizepräsident of the conservative student combination of the University of Nottingham, mentioned in a Sunday newspaper: “There is an increasing on the left of tendency at universities.
The people believe, we are like the Bullingdon club, without us to have at all become acquainted”.
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a historical student in Corpus Christi, which initiated the request for larger protection, is the opinion, such a climate is “unpleasant”. 19-year old Stephanie Cherill, designate president of the conservative student combination of Oxford says, with JCR members an increasing refusal observed her opposite students moderate rights.
“This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members”, says it.
In my first weeks in Oxford I belonged to such a minority.
As unbelievably shy 18-year old I had arrived in September 1986.
The hate on the conservative a party had reached its high point.
In the previous year the university had been correct for it to lend to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to shortening in the university nature no honour title.
The atmosphere would have let startle even stalinists.
In the first days of the frosh week, at which new students become acquainted with themselves and the tutors, I received a foretaste on the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not only bear the derision of Tory students, but even with pleasure to it participated.
Political issues like the miner strike, the privatisation and the refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled areas of the Tutoriums.
With my first of these meetings I should French texts from that 18. Century into English translate. On what should come then, I had not been calm.
“Miss Wyatt”, said the tutor Harry Pitt (meanwhile died), “translates you please the first paragraph”.
I tripped thereby.
Pitt was a small man with a face as nasty from cake paste, and rather.
“Refusing itself Thatcher supporters learning French or they are simply only stupid? ”, he asked me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes tears wallten up.
“I suggest that they take a few French hours in your spare time - thus, if you are not too much busy with your social activities, snarled at” me Pitt.
I returned with hanging head to my room.
On this evening I sat in the college alone during dinner, when someone typed me easily on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, which introduced itself as member of the conservative student combination.
“I know, who you are”, said he friendly.
Unfortunately is it, as it is.
Everyone, which is suspected to be Tory is oppressed.
For me it is already bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, therefore it for you will be worse.
Most Tory froshes give to be supporters of the labour party.
In a local pub I tried later to adjust me.
I insisted on the fact that I not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion was.
This trick should prove as unsuccessful.
A first-year university student in the subject philosophy, politics and economy, which ironically as conservatively valid Eton the college had visited, said to me: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig”.
You are dirty.
Other students divided his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
“As Tories have sex? ”, one asked me.
Those strike themselves mutually, or?
I felt in such a way, as homosexuals before the more liberal legislation of the United States must have felt.
Would I succeed ever to lead at the University of Oxford a normal life?
Could I meet like-minded ones only after dark?
Should I to the labour party turn and my natural inclinations to suppress have?
The three years, which lay before me, stretched before my mental eye to a purgatory of the proscription and the isolation.
The only tutor, who gave to recognize each other openly as Tory, was Norman Stone, professor for contemporary history, which had his seat in my college.
To be hated it not only for it, a conservative, but also, because he had advised Thatcher in things foreign policy and had written for her speeches.
Only rarely there it was.
He hated the place, found him to provincial and narrow-minded and rejected him for its Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
1997 it accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
“You will become not happy here”, said he to me.
I began to oscillate between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more unlocked friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
It seemed disbelieving.
While its time in the 40s all political views were accepted.
“However it is the best place in the world”, said it sheepish.
Something like that they would never do, not in my city to that dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends put always perfect manners to the day.
Its damp eyes clouded themselves.
Give to the whole one an opportunity.
I am safe, one neckt you only.
It would break the heart to me, if you went.
By my frequent journeys to London my emotional resistance became exhausted more weakly.
One of my male friends, Tory supporters, had likewise given way to the pressure and its convictions had renounced.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, with which a further historical tutor had seriously stated, I am “an enemy of the people”, decided I, the same to do.
Although I melted secretly before shame, I added that my parents of a “brainwashing” had submitted me, and called them “old nincompoops”.
The relief persisted only briefly.
It was my father, who struck the last nail into the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time wrote it per week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave up my Hä.
When they went, I packed a suit-case and took the first course to London.
I never returned.
Gladly you can call a tearful wimp me.
But no 18-year old should have ever in an educational facility under such intimidation and wickedness suffering.
And it is still tragic that it was Oxford - a university, which did not only bring 14 Tory prime ministers out, but until today behind an undeserved call of equal rights and freedom of thought hides themselves.
