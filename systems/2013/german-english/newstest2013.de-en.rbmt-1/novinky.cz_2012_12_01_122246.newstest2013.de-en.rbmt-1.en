Guidelines for blowing up ballons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which proclaims annually a survey over the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to organize the competition “most absurd regulation and/or idea from the European Union-workshop”.
“On this idea us the plan brought forward recently by the European Union brought to introduce a woman ratio of 40% in the management of large European companies”, said Patrik Nacher, who worries about the organization of this survey, opposite the newspaper to Právo.
Under the nominated absurdities for example the judgement of the European Court of Justice is over the standardization of insurance rates for men and women.
By then women enjoyed an advantage with life insurances, because they represent a smaller risk for the insurance companies objectively.
“Further ones unbelievable ideas from the European Union-workshop can be nominated until the end of this year.
The actual vote effected then to at the end of February 2013”, communicated Nacher.
To the controversies among other things the obligatory admixture from bio ethanol belongs to EU regulations to fuels, which is nature-damaging in its consequence, the further prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometers, only because these contain a relative to small quantity of this danger material, or also the guideline the size of chicken cages, therefore in this year eggs became substantially more expensive.
Criticism harvested the actual prohibition of the use of the term “butter upstroke” or also the sales ban for conventional bulbs in the past also.
Bananas must be long 14 cm
The European union-apparatus decides to be usually represented often under the pressure of these or that lobby from trade and industry, their demands in Brussels of one or more member countries (thus Czech Republic tries at present for example to implement also with veto threat the demands of Czech banks).
Interests of lobby stood also behind the fact that bananas of the highest grade in the European Union at least 14 cm to be long to have and no “anomaly of curvature” to exhibit be allowed.
The European commission defended itself with the fact with the argument that it harmonizes only the non-uniform standards of the individual nations, which would obstruct the trade.
The standards concerning fruit and vegetable were already macerated by the European Union against the resistance of some countries with the reference that the past guidelines would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is possibly the EU regulation from the past year, which in accordance with ballons with the sale with the reference it will provide must that children may not blow the ballon up under eight years without supervision of an adult.
The European Union referred thereby to an American study, which is in accordance with ballons the prominent cause with the asphyxiation death of children.
A similar restriction is valid already for children to 14 year with the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are strange ideas also at home
Relatively absurdly is also a guideline, which concerns the European officials - everyone, which takes an official function in the European Union, may use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece not and must instead FYROM (molder Yugoslav Republic OF Macedonia) to say.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com of liberal economist Laissez fair one apart from the above mentioned absurdities nominated also the EU regulation over the extent of food supplies in the area of a member country in co-operation with the federation.
The European Union specified thereby the maximum volume at food supplies, which could be on the day of our EU accession in the area of the Czech republic.
Czech Republic then e.g. exceeded the fixed volume for mushroom tinned food, for which a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were impressive also of the idea that certain countries should receive money for it that they do not have a sea, or however of the idea to give aid money for requests for aid money.
These ideas originated certainly not from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will request, explained refund at the European Union” in the autumn 2004 the Secretary of Agriculture at that time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As argument he stated that grain harvest had been very high and the national camps were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases.
Since Czech Republic has a further way to seas port, the European Union should pay according to Palas hundreds millions euros at us.
The European commission came to meet Czech Republic finally so far that it organized an advertisement over the purchase of grain from countries, which do not have an entrance to the sea.
The Ministry for regional development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) offered aid money for requests for aid money to the communities, concretely should it thereby means for taking up of aid money requests at Brussels concern.
European Union: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the member countries easily to the target of the criticism, the efforts of the European Union around adjustment and concomitantly around effectiveness and development of the entire European union earned according to opinion of some experts however rather acknowledgment.
A more serious problem are according to opinion of these experts rather the European Union-aid money for projects, which do not have purely nothing at all together with the recess of the European integration, which were forced however with the household negotiations by individual member countries.
In this country also the fact causes emotions that Czech Republic must fight similarly as other member countries in Brussels for the right to use of specific designations of traditional products and this fight thereby always does not win.
Czech Republic could defend after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria the designation “Olomoucké tvarůžky”, the resident rum (Tuzemský rum), its tradition with us in 19. Century goes back, had to rename our manufacturers however in “Tuzemák”.
The designation rum may be used only for products of sugar tubing distillate, not for products of sugar beets.
In the official list of the products registered in the European Union emerge in the society world-famous cheese places feta cheese and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker of marzipan or the Parmaschinkens now also that Carlsbad rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer the hop.
About a European Union-mark the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer roles can gloat there.
