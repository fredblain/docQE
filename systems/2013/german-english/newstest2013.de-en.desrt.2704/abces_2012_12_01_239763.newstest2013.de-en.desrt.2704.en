For the four euro of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they are 70 kilos of sulphur, the steep, stony path.
There are people, for their work, the hell is literally, and other work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 Minenarbeiter who deserve to get their lives by sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
The same applies to it every day on the ground down his Kraters increase in the world where the gas ausströmende schwefelhaltige stuck in contact with the air.
Given the major Schwefelsteine it undermined as a whole can weigh up to 70 kilos, he has moved it in two Bambuskörben on its shoulders further about the blocking of stone.
