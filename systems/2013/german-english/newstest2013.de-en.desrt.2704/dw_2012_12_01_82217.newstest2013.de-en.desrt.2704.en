Szabo: ``German greater role to play '
Germany has in the vote on the reception of Palestine.
According to expert, Stephen Szabo US-Europ - European relations, Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
firstly: Deutsche Welle indicated at the beginning of the week, as Germany, that it was against the application for observer status for the Palestinians would vote at the United Nations.
Then, however, contain Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have not done.
Now Germany must be given its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate to its independence, without, however, to be critical of Israel.
Throughout the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstain, as it were, to establish a no - fly zone.
This was achieved by NATO.
Fällt it difficult on important international issues, Germany, to take a clear position?
Yes, it is true.
The reason is that it has just been surrounded and its foreign policy away from a policy of the United States, as it were, to pay a German foreign policy.
Erschwerend that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform have added to this policy.
The Germans, that is, between the lines.
One of them is that they play a more independent role, but they are not used.
I believe that they are making are still in their role, but they are on the way to a more normal 'foreign policy'.
A foreign policy, as they have in France or the United Kingdom.
What means a'n ormal 'foreign policy as from a German point of view?
you shows the willingness to national interests, to adopt positions, which are independent of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy of economic policy, in other words by the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East, is motivated.
Germany to protect economic interests to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and Germany must therefore its interests.
Did they had economic impact on the attitude of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
For Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
And we must be careful, the public, but also the elites, not only in the Arab countries.
This is definitely a role.
But I would not want to attach a great deal of weight, that is not wholly unilateral relationship.
But it is definitely an important role in German considerations.
Where Germany damaged its relations with the United States, by the vote on major decisions such as the vote on Palestine has to contain?
I believe in Europe, and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding for the German position.
And I do not believe that this is a just as in the Libyan question was more dramatic rift.
Maybe einspielen Germany will also ensure that even a certain respect.
Because it signals that it as an international players must be taken seriously and its interests.
There are different views in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, have clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there any differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
The American domestic affairs of these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under President Obama has, without a great deal of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation is, of course, the government could not publicly supported that position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion as it always does not seem to be so great.
If you look at the relationship between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama, President Obama is not so enthusiastic about taken by Netanyahu hellauf policy.
Fällt Germany it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans, if it were a coherent and unified European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they will not be part of a broader approach and we must instead push things from their own point of view.
The make it is with the euro.
I believe that Germany will in future play a leading role, to urge Europe to a European position.
That is, of course, not just to Germany, because the relationship with Israel.
That has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that is the German clear that they play a more independent role.
Sieht even in Germany's role as an important international players - Germany wants to play a leading role at all?
Oder, Germany is still difficult for the leadership role?
Germany is still not being used, it is embarrassing and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
If we look at the example of the euro crisis, because each time when Germany, adopts a greater role, various anti-deutsche feelings.
It is not just the Germans.
That is actually the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany However, in a far worse position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and it is not easy.
Well, the influence of the United States is continuously in European policy, the EU does not, for the moment, this vacuum, who is otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it, and a lot of them is an unpleasant unpopular, c' est la vie it!
