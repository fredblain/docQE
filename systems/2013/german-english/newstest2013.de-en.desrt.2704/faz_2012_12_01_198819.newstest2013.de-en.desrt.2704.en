'protection of trademarks' in China: If Puma Armani and a sudden the Chinese
Armani is a world - renowned, Ralph Polo Lauren.
What Armani Polo is this?
Dahinter a quite officially registered designation in China, but it is nothing to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen.
they work for so long as the actual protection regime not complain about.
And even then it is not clear whether the law.
``It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brand 'in China, Thomas Pattloch says that a lawyer in the sessional services to Schutzrechtsverletzungen Wessing Taylor, which specialises in the Far East.
Every week, a new case, ends up on my desk.
The Nachahmern a few additional letter, so that they can express their brands.
However, will sign Lu-Gucci power instead of simply Prada Prada-Kny it is.
Even German companies are legally copied in this way, for example, the sports goods manufacturers Puma.
Pattloch opens with a raft of registration of the Community Trade Mark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010 was a Chinese company protect trademarks, a somewhat Zegna DF Puma, which is also the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna used.
The fact that the Chinese are known champion in copying and the injured intellectual property.
In the big cities are mehrstöckige department, the almost exclusively to sell counterfeiting.
Pattlochs cases but are different: On behalf of his client, however, it is the case that Chinese companies are quite officially received the right to use a term which is already protected, elsewhere.
The Chinese call this' Mingpai bang ', a Beifahrermarke.
That word is' Dakuan bang '.
It is women who are rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are well aware of any blame
'That is, we must combat geschäftsschädigend Pattloch'.
``watered down, will mark the Alleinstellung disappear, the 'Imageschaden is enormous.
The financial losses Prozesskosten of the industries concerned and which run into millions, especially where expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
After the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA China is with a budget of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest - growing.
However, the dubious entries Löschungen Markenregister are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Until the procedure to nine years is dragging on, with an uncertain end.
Pattloch reporting of cases in which the court complaints about the effort, because the name 'after' reality is the long term.
If the plaintiff have the misfortune of having to pay, Plagiator even money, because its brand Pattloch violated in China.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Berühmte cases also affect graphic elements.
Daimler lost in 2009 a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, that businesses, which recently took the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister.
The Chinese must therefore use until now, a symbol which resembles Mercedes-Stern.
The Volvo-K äufer Geely one originally used blau-wei emissions logo of BMW, reminded us, the dispute was resolved Geely, had to change it.
The Modehersteller Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, which would ensure the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are well aware of any blame.
The case to CTMO in Beijing is true that there are low 2010 staff and have better facilities were bottlenecks.
Last year it was returned from the 'but' emergency situation in business to normality.
However the stock is unbearbeiteter appeals fell by 22%.
Almost 57.000 such cases we have been completed, 75% more than in the previous year.
yet still in office 81.500 objections are awaiting execution.
However much it costs to tackle
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, 1.4 million more than the CTMO requests received on protection of trademarks, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China and for the tenth time, the list of consecutive Neuanmeldungen in the world, to quote the authority.
This applies also to the stock of all the existing brands, 5.5 million as a whole.
1.8 billion in 2011 are yuan charges have been taken.
Vereinfacht which means that any notification 1280 yuan and the average cost of EUR 160.
However, as a cost to the case of the German family firm Freudenberg.
For more than seven years ago, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans were able to ensure that its illegal production Kraftfahrzeugteile imitation has been exposed.
However, the more the Chinese rights secured to the brand Freudenberg.
You have failed to do that in Germany, because family names, could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler says, the chairman of the management of Chemical Freudenberg Specialities in Munich.
The case was CTMO back the appeal of the Munich.
Over the next two bodies, while Freudenberg received, but fighting Prozessgegner further until today.
We must be extremely careful
Now the issue is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says:' The procedure is extremely expensive and will cost us a great deal of time, money and nerves'.
The internal costs are difficult to quantify, which leaves Firmenarchiv have even one hundred years old files, to provide proof.
Before Freudenberg five years on the other side of the House was in vain for a ``high Eurobetrag 'Decision on the resolution.
'Kultura we see how far it is worth us Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threatening to Europe.
Then, if there are unprotected imitators secure.
There was a Chinese manufacturers in Germany for the textile and leather shoes Freudenberg for.
This area of business of the company, but he has been able to prevent the registration.
'You must be careful not to say extremely Wentzler'.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch German companies to do business with China, to be very careful.
It is not enough in itself to international trademark rights, instead of leaving the foreigners or 'everything should somehow is worth protecting, including in China ', as Wentzler says.
Sonst this can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, the case: Freudenberg last act of his Markendramas is, then we should pay the licence fees for the other party's own behalf, Wentzler.
Oder we will be pushed out of the market in the sector in question.
