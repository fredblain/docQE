Eigener taste ru rosbalt - instead of culture.
Rosbalt is the project 'Petersburg vanguard ," which is devoted to city dwellers, which are the avant - garde of the art and culture.
On the fine list already high - level representatives, of the Petersburg Kunstszene, whose achievements on the borders of the city and the often go beyond recognition in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be aware.
The new hero of the artists is Rosbalt extravagante Kirill Miller.
The entire city knows Kirill Miller, the red - clad Bärtigen that we may, to the Russian museum Sommergarten, or Vernissagen Szene-Treffen in them.
Where are the images of Kirill Miller, they also be issued to attract huge crowd.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg sozial-philosophischen artists, which are creating new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personalities of the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the 1980s, or at the beginning of the 1990s.
He is a man of the city and by pulling its presence in the street with a smile on the face of its citizens and is causing them for good humour.
Before he recently schnappte a Drehorgel and the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler, as it is for these difficult role in terms of its Künstlerdasein, its image and its underlying philosophy was finally ready.
- Kirill why you are always in red and not for example in the city or Türkis?
I have chosen a red Modedesigner on the optics and the image.
In this world of red is the compromise between artists, spin - doctors and society.
In a society is something quite different from what the Graunorm, aggression and bad behaviour.
I want to make my provocation but with the people.
Every an invitation was my last provocation to the discussion.
When you - wusstest painter, that you have to be?
- In an exhibition in Kulturpalast Newskij were issued, in my work.
I realised that this is the way to go.
Then the period of the old free, but not officially recognised that painters, and new and free painter such as I was incomprehensible.
I like the painters are on friendly terms with the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the 'Gazonewschina; hence, ``Puschkinskaja 10, and then it was even closure.
It is there to the theatre, to fashion, music, literature, in addition to all.
So, all of the united in your Art-Klinik... It was important to me, in the centre of the Petersburg culture, where the best should creative artists.
In 1995, an area in which I occupied Puschkinskaja 10 and there to the renovation musikalisch-k ünstlerischen a club for the Boheme the House of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M. Tequilajazzz, and I remember how string with its project 'Ucho Van Goga to'.
string and his friends, simple songs on Play-back, wearing T - shirts and close to them and which today was mature composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group was started to play in Leningrad, its' live '.
Trachtenberg moderierte many programmes before the time of 'Halli-Galli'.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began its great careers, but he met with us.
Even the gallery'D 137 'or the' club 'Griboedov have their origin in Art-Klinik.
Dorthin Stammgäste and our staff.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there have been in the press, a survey of the prize 'personalities of our town of'.
I received in the category of 'artists of the year, and I was reached peak.
It is not easy in new times for old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to be renowned, but culture and popularity are not the same: the famous It would be without a cultural contribution to make.
- your work, a distinctive form.
Many images, my very real gems and the timeliness and rigour of the idea.
I will be an exhibition on the issue of 'The Russian museum as students'.
students are timeless.
I was socially however painful, but it now and is preparing to be afraid of.
In a clown the blurred and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I was grotesque ideas.
- saving the world, for example by making that everyone has to dress up completely.
It respects everyone in the clothing and is based on the Outer and not at the heart of the people.
But perhaps we should give a people, but should not be biting the face of it.
The deceit by the Verkleiden disappear.
Before you - we saw recently in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers. - A City of Culture should have as a hero.
Who, if not I?
- commercial art Will it be?
Nowadays, must be cautious, with commercial art and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
however, people were the major groups: The Bohemiens liebten the An ordinary people and the other.
Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to all.
I am no Einhundert-Dollar-Note that everyone likes.
Now, you have to consider what you will.
Now everyone Kultstar has approximately 100 supporters.
- On the appearances by Stas Michailow but there are several thousand.
- On him, abandoned women sexuell-soziale the world plays a role.
The 300 people and cultural reasons, not ten thousand, consequently, there is less money management, and everything.
I voted in favour, and the most important thing is not to deceive and they do not destroy what we have achieved.
In my youth I have painted such images to a collector even in a series of pictures of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures, which normally only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are many misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
consumption has no culture, this is something quite different.
I am a man of the past, culture and with artists, who were living in poverty and died in poverty and money, in order to be able to raise.
That is the culture, which I support.
- Kirill what Petersburg?
- the best Kulturexperten.
It says: servants of culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real tsars it was different, because the Tsars may not seen much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
The St. Petersburg, we have the experts, but they could be blocked, the way in which it is properly assess hochrangigerer experts and the former open to them.
Now only one's own taste.
Erarta applies to do this, however, with the difference that they say in all honesty that it does not accept any contemporary art and therefore some painters need to seek other museums.
- Concerning for thee Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is much more culture and a breeding ground.
At our stones art can only grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground for example, because we now have more than reader writers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many people who are visiting organises concerts exhibitions or.
For us, these are much less.
art must again be up - to - date, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be financed from grants the town of St Petersburg
