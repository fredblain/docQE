A Spurensuche in the country in which 97-J - are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch-Gebirge wildromantisch is to give.
The Kleinbus rumpelt kurvenreiche on the roads and past densely forested hills reißenden, rivers and simple Bauernhäusern.
Everything is green saftig and you would think that it would be in the Black Forest.
However, it is the lowest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here the Caucasian Talyschen lives of the population, which is not much aware, except that it is perfect and Persian Aserisch and long lasting.
terminus Lerik is.
The small city flaunts wuchtig too greedy architecture from Soviet times, so I do not want the malerische Berglandschaft.
tourists in Europe will be too onerous hardly here, that is the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku.
For the 323 kilometres of eight hours is needed, because the road is only einspurig.

The man was married and had three times 23 children, aged 136 years have shown a daughter to it.
Has Şirali Müslümov his age is due in a few decades?
But also Altersforscher Rembrandt Scholz, on Max-Planck-Institut in Rostock has, from the very elderly in Central Asia.
'Auffallend hochaltrige there are many people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza-Tal in Pakistan' Scholz says that 'in Sardinia lots of very old men live'.
Due to a lack of documentation, however, is no scientific evidence on the basis of age, as there were missing.
Every day becherweise geschmolzene butter
, however, is the fact that the people of the region around Lerik a remarkably often biblisches age.
For the moment, there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.

The propaganda sounds from the mouths of an old woman.
However, the cult of the will of the nation, does the nation as a dictator his country, knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
