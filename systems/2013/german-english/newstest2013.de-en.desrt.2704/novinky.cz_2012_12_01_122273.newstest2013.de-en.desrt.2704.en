'The people want am I the Republic, but I am just an amateur Okamura'.
Senator, as it is to the idea, for the office of President to stand?
It is not about being Senator or President.
If everything in our country without problems, I would not be standing.
But I can no longer see how the Republic since 20 years, as thieves will be plundered to roam freely, while the tax increase the retirement age and the people.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
If I see something that I did not like to put forward a solution that I try to change this.
And, as I have already, 40 and independent and parteilos, I have no other way of influencing the things as a senator for the office of the President or to stand for election.
In the Senate, and you have managed to put it on the road to the Burg.
You will not back your voters?
I have been told that I take up the fight to Burg after the result of senate.
Später I have this clarified and said that I for the office of President, if I am elected to Senator am going to stand for election.
My aim, however, is not the function. The role is an instrument with which I, my vision a reality.
This I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
The difficulty is not only that the people in the pub and in front of the television of the change, but to everyone, starting
The same applies to the media, to deprive the honour and the lie to the freedom of speech, the confused with freedom.
For me, for example, has been said that I would be bribing journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek advisers.
we speak about your vision.
The battle with the Burg you have the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million kroner.
The same applies to you need to change legislation.
When President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can table legislative proposals.
How do you intend to resolve this problem?
As a citizen, I have argued that the tour guide a free trade, and it is to be implemented.
The problem is the small - minded policy, when someone from the right or the left with a good proposal, this is deliberately rejected, and this is just to the population.
The independent Parteiloser I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in the Parliament.
My advantage is that I have no Schubladendenken Parteidogmen me and from any party that what our country is the best we can take.
Can you see itself as a person in the policy more on the left or the right?
The Czech point of view, it seems to me that the left me rather see the people.
For me this Rechts-Links-Denken, though, is quite important.
For me, it is important that we make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone on the left or on the right wing, and I would like to link the people.
Stets I support public any good solution, even if these KSČM or the ODS and, equally, I will turn against bad ideas.
It is you, when you referred to as the populists.
But you confirm this not by what you have just said?
If you draw up in a company, then a Businessplan Idealziel and you also have a vision.
And do you wish to address this.
One can I describe it as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to operate in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament you remain mere buzzwords.
And so that you are not a long - term policy.
Oder you think that, for example, to the material and criminal liability? you, if you only around long enough, the people will be able to talk about
I have no other option.
politicians, journalists and the public and to try to persuade them to get on our side in order to achieve these objectives.
When President, it is not a problem for me to call on the leaders of the parliamentary parties broadcast live on television, the substantive criminal law and to establish liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the Angesprochenen would say if necessary, then, why do they object to this.
A strong personality, which refers to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take your only once the direct election of the President, which has been a credit to the public pressure.
I would like to say quite clearly that I am an amateur I am neither a genius; an enlightened.
I am trying to find allies for my views and vision.
With the policy I have only just beginning and try to find that my programme for the support of the majority.
I am trying to make things even more; and if it does not work, then I am again in six years in the private sector.
That sounds as though a little Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not.
I know that I can do nothing for that reason alone, I have talked with several famous people whether they do not wish to stand for the Senate.
I have spoken with Radim Jančura for example, rejected, however, as a result of the excessive.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová had, the fraud in the trade in a light fuel oil.
I began my candidacy with the requirement that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not sure.
Sechzig% of the electorate are not left to the elections, and who are elected representatives have been mostly the establishment.
The Senate we are only two independent.
The people have chosen Senatszusammensetzung a that such changes will be very difficult to implement.
Even so, I shall fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and Bezirkshauptmänner.
that you thought about the establishment of the EU's own party?
I think I have not yet, because I have no time to review the past, and that any potential Parteimitglieds also do not have the money for it.
I do not even have money to Präsidentenkampagne; my transparent accounts CZK only 20 000.
You have no money?
Vermögenserklärungen you are talking about, what would you?
My personal fortunes I value of around CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a piece of land, with a value of ECU 25 million, a home for around 10 million to 8 million, a further an art collection, which belongs, which is worth about 10 million, and a Ashton Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about a million. And then I have a couple of million to the bank account.
The Ashton Martin was a Kindertraum James Bond - I was always been, as it was in the car galant was to women and, at the same time, against the evil.
Martin a Ashton, you have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
you say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money you want to invest in this.
That is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make up about debt?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have any sponsors, shows that the programme is not a great deal of interest.
And I am not obliged to provide the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign, in essence, be covered by my salary as a senator.
But the Senatorengehalt I could not live alone; I could, for example, my son not finance the English schools, the 30 000 per month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I would be able to stand for nothing.
Be so further than entrepreneurs have your work to make a living?
Sagten you not feel that these activities are being cut?
But this is not related to the level of pay.
As promised, I have cut back some of my activities.
However my deputy director of the agencies in the spring.
The people want to see, which saves me as Samaritan of the Republic.
But I must also live by.
An which you have been accustomed as entrepreneurs, monthly income?
Approximately 200 000 and 400, 000, and that is still the case.
As President, I would, however, to my question.
