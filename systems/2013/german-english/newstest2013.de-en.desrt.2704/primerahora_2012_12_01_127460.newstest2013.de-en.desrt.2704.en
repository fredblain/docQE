Héctor 'Hetin Reyes ": ``basketball was my life'
The Weltenbummler Basketballs of Héctor Hetin ," ``the Korbsport Reyes, has been more than 60 years and has visited the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of the country as' Basketballs Héctor Hetin Reyes'.
Before he, in 2008, by a stroke of the wheelchair Rexes, 6 years was part of that sport, it should be a player and lower classes, players in the first national League and head of the agent BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or Basketballverbands President.
'My life I have drafted in basketball me many, indeed, several hats at the same time, when I was the chief BSN President, the President of the Union and national team in the 1990s are reminded Reyes, during a visit by Primera Hora at home with him in Bayamón, Isabel, its loyal wife, for more than 50 years of residence.
'basketball was my life.'
Reyes not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of this House long career, they are almost all dekoriert with photographs and memories of his and bear witness to it.
Bayamón heart
The emotionalsten memories are those that in his time Vaqueros in the middle of the 1950s, the players to 1982, where it will be celebrated as Mitgeschäftsführer or 15 - year - old anniversary of the club managers.
These were 'my best years that I have enjoyed the most, because I would be part of the eight championships Vaqueros since 1967, it was as Mitgeschäftsführer or coach.
It was met many years, including five championships in 1975, one by one, the 1971.
And then I have adopted with a championship in 1981, the year of Debüts of Jerome Mincy BSN in.
From then took over 'Cuco Ortiz', which was a very good managers' Reyes says.
I know that at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was given to me Bartow genes, worked as a trainer and said: ``I have a very strong and 2 m big players.
Möchtest you it? '
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, Puerto Rico had ever.
Bartow subsequently the recommended Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, which was one of our best and could creep Werfer.
I know, as he said that, if a championship Mincy allows for Bayamon Gausse had to be a further.
The Vaqueros Gausse with the championship, but he was already out of a gap in 1988, because it already has been at the top of the Union.
At that time, he drew it to enjoy its application and the Mincy in the national football team.
I remember when we first time on the vorolympischen Turnier in Mexico, against the United States.
bronze should be, if not actually Canadian the referee the recent Spielzug after the World Cup was in 1990, in which we said Reyes, whereas the fourth place repeat what has, for the second time,
War this group of the World Cup in 1990, the best national team you have ever seen?
you is one of the best, as well as those who work in the 2004 Olympic Games to the dream team won.
My favourite but the team of the 1991 panamerikanischen Games in Cuba, where we won and gold the team of the United States has offered a fight, as when they won in the World Cup bronze.
With regard to the crew were not only Mincy Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Robert Fico López and 'Piculín Ortiz (once again), but also the young players (Javier) ',' Toñito Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, the 1990, for a Knieverletzung not able to be here.
A team, which in terms of figures, perhaps not the best, but with the gold medal won and which are a cause of great joy of those was vorolympischen Turniers Neuquén in 1995, Argentina.
With such as' Canito Nieves' players, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the players are closed because of the events in the Mar del Plata Panamerikanischen Games, we won contrary to all the gold medal forecast.
Who was the best players of Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournament are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico at this level that has dominated Piculín as such.
And this, without taking account of his career in the various bodies, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We had a number of good and coach, Julio Toro Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boy I like the work of Leo Arill well.
Do I is the best in the Association of what you have achieved?
I was part of the most successful era of national team from 1988 to 1995 BSN the beginning of the 1990s was up to 17 teams in a season.
What you are doing is?
There are things that I could have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The fact that the boys Ponce in, for example, only play in their territory, and only in the national Playoffs on crews from other parts of the island.
Today many children make unnecessary travel and Games.
I see at least the result of the prescribed and training courses for coach, and referee Tisch-Offizielle.
I am proud of my.
What you are going to do now?
I am happy to listen to music, videos of music my time on YouTube and enjoy my grandchildren and I can go to a Basketballspiel.
And of course, I have been enjoying my wife, Isabel society, which was always on my side.
