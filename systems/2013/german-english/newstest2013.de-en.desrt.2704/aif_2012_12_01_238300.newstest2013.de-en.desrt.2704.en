'The large and powerful' by Moscow: migrants will save money for language
As parliamentarians and civil rights activist, what point about the law on binding language tests for immigrants, criminals are discussing will act with fake certificates
market 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow and St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
The majority of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your sole aim is to make money for the maintenance of the remaining families in the country.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which any working immigrant, a test for the knowledge of the Russian language must be certified.
No, this regulation applies only to migrants in the services sector, in the local housing stock and to work in the retail trade.
Jedoch the tests should be according to the time Föderaler Migrationsbehörde compulsory for all migrant workers in the future.
Mr President, we must not only language tests for tests, but also in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
language skills must be demonstrated both for the maintenance and extension of the work permit.
exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Ebenfalls of this law will be excluded from the people who receive their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the break - up of the Soviet Union in 1991.
sense issue and protection of human rights
The whole of the Prüfungsstellen under the aegis of the Puschkin-Instituts for the Russian language, the Russian University of the friendship among peoples, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can all the tests in cities; now in Russia more than 160 appropriate centres already been opened.
The initiative on the implementation of the tests was supported by the members of the Duma and the Federal Migrationsbehörde.
civil rights activist, however, before the entry into force of the law on several occasions in the press, the following question: What is all this about?
What changes does the provision of languages, to deliver both for the Russians and the migrant workers?
In particular, the spokesman for the Migrationsbehörde say, is concerned, to reduce the number of forced labourers.
``Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, the head 'says the representation of the Federal Migrationsbehörde in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
your rights must be protected, but they had left already.
Just an organised recruitment to 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future without necessarily the migrant languages people are putting it under the pretext of aid in the dark, close shack with dozens of assembling, where he and his ilk months without food and documents 12 to 14 hours of the day, will be able to meet, is ill - intentioned
We have achieved many complaints from our migrants.
'In the country, you promised this one, and it has been duped, you will get their passports and not the' promised, the head of the headquarters for migration, the Tajik Migrationsbehörde Tolib Schwaripow.
Not, head!
however many citizens of the Central Asian republics, in Russia who want to earn money that they control not only the language of the country of destination, but also in their own language, can hardly in writing.
Of course that is not their fault, but rather the evil: Just a few the Turkmen people can afford them and Tajiks a sensible of primary education.
Because there are still in their families do not even have money to feed the children, let alone to buy them, proper clothing, footwear and Schulsachen.
As these children, teenagers to take the first opportunity for making money.
'It is difficult not to be' languages.
'You humiliated and inferior fühlst thee.'
civil rights activist in terms of the law to stress the following important aspect.
The test only to legal migrants.
Did you not this status, there are no examination and thus no official work.
Währenddessen the vast majority of the migrant workers is also illegal in Russia.
'Herzlich welcome' or 'entry ban for unauthorised'
Many migrants confirm that in Russia to receive an official status is not easy.
The reasons are bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
: legalising costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rouble.
A false registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that most of our documents and we are not registered, and then to be cases of blackmail.
'you are one or two hundred rouble for cigarettes and tea, expresses the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
'Bloß spare no expense on false papers'
Right on the day on which the law was entered into force, that it is not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates to certify the completion of the language tests of staff, the Federal Migrationsbehörde beschlaggenommen were already.
The counterfeit documents were printed Farbdrucker with a normal.
Of course the new owners of these were not free of charge: Any migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid seven thousand rouble of the document.
That is more than twice as much as the costs of the official test: This costs three thousand rouble a migrant workers.
I that the most important task is to direct the system there is corruption, so that certificates to protect cannot simply be bought, both are officials and human rights activists.
For the moment, the authorities can immigrant workers in the first time by the test, only promise that they will be time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
I also offer newcomers languages are without jobs in areas where no active dialogue with people is necessary.
