Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the test should be made or not?
The PSA-Test to reject, in fact, sometimes incorrect results with false or negative, but also false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to greater hesitation, the cowardly men for conducting Früherkennungstests.
Should the test, or not?
We have obtained two consultant's opinion.
The studies conducted in the United States were many disruptors between Kontrollgruppen so that to interpret the data and to give unambiguous recommendations is difficult.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that, when, after 12 years of Nachbeobachtung the likelihood of the education of Metastasen 30 and 40% higher, if no screening was conducted.
As such, I commend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years ago, when one has a direct relatives of the already been to prostate cancer.
When men afro-amerikanischer origin also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to take the right decision was recognised as a form of cancer.
There are other types of cancer and the aggressive the indolent.
According to the patients, the extent of the risk of cancer really made clear by the possible options left unaddressed Prostatakrebse which can, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases for a more active monitoring of the disease is it to be highlighted.
Today many men, in which it has no treatment of cancer, rather than, as it is not and aggressive cancer is not a threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them to progress in the treatment of the disease.
You certainly with greater accuracy of the criteria for deciding who should be treated, and who does not.
As such, I would recommend to the implementation of the tests.
The most important, but it is to speak with his GP, in order to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for Urologie Movember has developed a device, with which it is possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of PSA-Tests.

prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the field of research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers prevented if all good enough to eat and would be able to move around.
'If there were no more smokers, this figure will rise by at least 50%, André Beaulieu emphasised, the spokesman for the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft.
But is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by it.
Several remain unresolved.
For the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking of cases is responsible for 85% of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor in several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
'Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million, the spokesperson for smokers' regrets André Beaulieu.
Ermutigende reduce the risk of data, 10 years after the rejection of the cigarettes, to die of cancer.
The weight
According to the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
you seem to increase the risk of breast cancer, Grimmdarm - Mastdarm - Speiseröhren - Bauchspeicheldrüsen and cervical cancer.
'The research shows that there is a regular physical activity during the whole life of protecting against Grimmdarmkrebs'
The food
The Organisation recommends also to restrict the consumption of red meat.
In on a large scale, it increases the risk of a Grimm - or of the disease.
cooked meats should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by please or long process that could lead to the formation of carcinogens.
'and the body which can harm the development of cancer ', he said.
vitamins
In recent years several scientists have studied the connection between vitamin supplements - and cancer.
your investigations are at present no conclusive.
The Canadian Krebsgesellschaft vitamin E to the studies are contradictory.
During a study to reduce the risk of cancer, like others, has more of an increase.
The effect of Vitamin D on cancer has also still not made quite clear.
I also emphasised that it is Mr Beaulieu as important, with his GP of its concerns and his family - to speak.
'The implementation of a Früherkennungstest not lead to cancer.
