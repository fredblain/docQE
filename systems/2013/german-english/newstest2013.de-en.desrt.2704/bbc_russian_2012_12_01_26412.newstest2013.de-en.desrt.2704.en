As such, the many buy a slightly Walmart-Besch paid officials only on our own work.
The prices and Wal - Mart Warensortiment made one of the largest companies in the United States.

The protests were to continue this week in New York, where the aim, however, were not Walmart-Filialen (in the progressive city so far non - existent are therefore not desirable, but McDonald's and other low - cost restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billion chickens, and yet no Krankentage to you, and you will not pay for your honest work.

At the moment, the minimum wage in accordance with a federal and New York legislation at 7.25 dollar is the hour.
In Fast-Food-Restaurants will gradually increase the minimum wage, but not too much on average, and their ordinary people in New York of USD 8,90 the hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
How is it possible, in New York, with so little money is beyond me.
There was even a time when almost a quarter of all American young people in school at McDonald's behind the Theke, however, the young people were living in their parents.
Only a was seen as the main source of income or planned to revive, continue to remain there.
Well I meet in interviews with staff at McDonald's constantly people complain that it with this wage and sometimes even manage to feed their children.
Andererseits are there in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal a comment, the rapporteur points out, it is irresponsible to have children, if we did not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, on Thursday at 6.00 a.m. in the morning before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Avenue Madison, demanded that the bank teller and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants receive a minimum wage of USD 15 the moment which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage is in line with that.
you called for the education of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche.
The US law prohibits the governance, this objective to stand in the way of trade or to issue early warnings to and made redundant.
Andererseits the management, it is not easy.
The foundation of trade unions in the Fast-Food-Branche is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
are unhappy
Lautstarke protests it was on this day, many other Fast-Food-Restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was an Assembly at midday, McDonald's Times Square on, which were some local democrats, including Stadtratsmitglied Jumaane Williams, who said ,' McDonald's, billion chickens sell, and yet no Krankentage to you, and you will not pay for your honest work. '
The demonstrators have been supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that 'we support the Fast-Food-Mitarbeiter together so that they receive and achieve a fair wage should be the economic prosperity that everyone deserves New York.
According to the New York Times this was the main action of its kind in the history of the US Fast-Food-Industrie.
Jedoch only a few hundred people were on the ground, which is far from all in the Fast-Food-Branche are employed in New York in the tens of thousands of work.
As we do not yet know whether the flame of these protests mobilise a whole.
