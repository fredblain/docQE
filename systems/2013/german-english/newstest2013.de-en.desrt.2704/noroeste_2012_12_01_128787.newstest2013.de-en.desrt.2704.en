Following the Court of Appeal confirms the United States a judgement which recognises the restructuring of debt on the group Vitro Handelskonkurs in Mexico has been achieved, not a precedent is created, pernicious for, each national companies with establishments in the neighbouring country, there are payment problems.
We are, then, that the procedures for the survival of companies which allow the Mexican law in the country of the stars and stripes could say contrary to international agreement to be a valid.
In practice, on 15 June, the recognition of the judgment handed down by the judge Harlin Hale on court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas that the Mexican companies in the confiscation of property, on the other side of the River Congratulations are helpless.
But the biggest Glashersteller decision opens the door in Mexico, because three inconsistencies to refer the matter to the Supreme Court of the United States.
During the judges of the matter is that the main proceedings in Mexico Handelskonkurs dealt with by the Court of Appeal, says the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, begin by pointing out that the creditor, the bankruptcy rules must be subject to the United States.
The first point, the international cooperation in insolvency proceedings by companies with trans - national profile is not known.
In fact the Modellgesetz to this end the United Nations was created for the harmonisation of international trade law, with the American law has been set up as arbiter institutions.
Secondly the ruling states that the majority required for the restructuring of debt without the votes of the societies to recognise the liabilities in the liquidation of the branches Vitro with its parent company that had not been achieved.
But this possibility is recognised by the Mexican law.
In fact Vitro is not the first case in which this system has been allowed.
There are examples, including half a dozen Agremex Mexicana Comercial and their liabilities in the group of companies by the Istituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Handelskonkurse) have been confirmed.
the creditor Richtig is also that, after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches of Vitro, creditors in the courts in the United States against Vitro there, in other words the Geier-Fonds such as Capital Aurelios Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional Limited and Liverpool, have achieved a majority.
The vote was 45% would be against 37%.
This will not be taken into consideration by the Court of Appeal.
Andererseits Vitro there is blame for its difficult situation in 2008 in the framework of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country.
For this reason, the family, González Sada before the same court of appeal, so that the vote in plenary, that is to say, because of the judges were only three of them.
If not, the Cerciorare-Einspruch, will the calls for the review of the procedure by a higher body, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious aspect of this case is that the Court has set aside a document that the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the Court, which was sent by Vitro procedure within the framework of the law on what is described Handelskonkurse, and what that we stick to the agreements signed by the two countries to the chapter 15 Konkursgesetzes of the United States to comply with, and, had kept
is also important to point out that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on the international trade in other words, the rules laid down in the event of cross - border cases, guarantee equality of debtors and creditors.
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
