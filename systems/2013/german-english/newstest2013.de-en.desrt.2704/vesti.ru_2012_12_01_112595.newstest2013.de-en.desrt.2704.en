birth in outer space
Earth in danger.
global warming or clash with Killerasteroid.
Karawanen of spacecraft Erdbewohnern to make on board to the quest for a spare planet.
In order to save the human race, the important question of how we can or zero gravity to reproduce a spare planet?
Many choice is not in my opinion.
De facto there are only two real planet, we could at least on a hypothetical.
'Nämlich Mars and Venus ', says the scientific staff of Vladimir Surdin Astronomischen Sternberg-Instituts.
During the conditions on the surface to Mars are comparatively lebensfreundlich the Venus, a temperature of 500 level.
life would be only in large level or within the orbit of Venus, therefore, possible in space.
The issue of the researchers in space first discussed in terms of the flora.
Right carried out half a century before that experiments have to plants.
The fourth generation of the in - orbit peas was bred not in the slightest by the irdischen species.
It followed the breeding of insects, in greater detail by tiny Fruchtfliegen (Drosophila) in orbit.
In 1979 Wachteleier have been sent out into, in order to explore how the zero gravity has an impact on the development of embryos.
It is a normal chicks.
However, this problem.
'The problem is that the chicks find must stop; it must be able to stand on its own feet and start to get' Laborleiter explained, the Institute for medizinisch-biologische RAN problems, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground when the wild, chicks.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn stumpften from complete.
The chicks Laute and not reacting to light.
Four days later, be they died.
'Zweimal we have made a slip chicks and then see the whole thing, because it considers them Sychew Vladimir with the' experiment has failed to work with, chicks in space is simply impossible.
The last Brutkäfig with animals flew into orbit, 16 years ago.
In spring 2013 to the experiments be continued.
Jedoch Biosatelliten on the 'only' Bion of the same sex are species are.
There was an experiment with rats fertilised already sent into space.
(DE) In principle, it has been said here.
'It was precisely with the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only a single experiment, and research must be continued, Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing Weltraumratten got the offspring.
The problem was directly in the space of one has not yet been resolved.
The task is a difficult one.
animals that are taken from their natural habitats, can follow their Fortpflanzungstrieb not.
In contrast to the individual animals may in principle.
The Homo sapiens abstraktem is capable of thinking and to produce a similar emotional tide.
There are ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments.
However, women to fly into space for 50 years.
, Tereschkowa The greatest risk.
The Wertvollste that the human race has is the female body.
Our Möwe plane, and no one in the world should have been able to answer the following question: they Übersteht the Weltraumflug?
Will it, after this flight can bring a child into the world?
Lastly, no 'answered this question' Raumfahrtveteran Wachtang Watschnadse says.
In June in 1964, just one year after its Weltraumflug result, the first female Kosmonautin Valentina Tereschkowa, a girl.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988 result if the second in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja who was twice in - orbit and even work outside the Raumfahrzeugs a son.
Even so the risk remains.
We have only very few Kosmonauten, after long flights and they got was all very healthy new blood.
``The more, the dangerous, even on flights into orbit ', Kosmonaut concludes Valeryi Poljakow hero, hero of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.
And yet the humanity needs to find new methods in the field of biotechnology, the artificial radiation protection and the Erzeugen Gravitation.
The Hydrolabor Vorbereitungszentrum in the Kosmonauten is a compulsory stage during the ground.
Here in a state of flux the routine Kosmonauten gain for the work in the open space.
The water is zero gravity of the problem.
Even if adults water as a pleasant feel it is a strange surroundings; but babies are water as a natural element.
It is the small Ichtyander would testify to the life of the country is turning the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child in approximately nine months in the mother Fruchtwasser, and that it will then be easier to get used to water.
In principle it is logical, as from the cradle to the first to go swimming just two weeks ago.
'That is too little time to forget' Babyschwimmlehrerin says something, Marina Aksenowa.
As for a new - born baby the zero gravity natürlicherer so much from a woman is the state of affairs is not defied without.
In the state of the zero gravity back the gut Beckenmuskulatur and very quickly, and it is therefore also the ability to extract the child.
All right, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
The birth could take place, for example, in a Spezialkammer to extract the child.
``But what happens? ', which is no insignificant matter of Valeryi Poljakow.
Andererseits the child needs also defied artificial.
Without the Erdanziehung, to feel the body can train the skeleton and muscles.
A new - born child could be set as an adult in - orbit to train in a Belastungsanzug.
he simply lack the will for his life, which is of fundamental importance.
'This experiment which we jointly, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will mean that we have an entirely unangepassten a disabled people in the world ', says, the director of the institute for Bioethikkommission medizinisch-biologische, Igor Pestow RAN problems.
No the birth of children in outer space is merely a theory.
Irgendwann however, it is a reality if the people in their spacecraft a distant planet is the home of the space for their offspring born heading.
