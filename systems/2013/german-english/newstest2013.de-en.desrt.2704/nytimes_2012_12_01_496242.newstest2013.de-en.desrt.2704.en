In a constantly elektrisierten world, it is all very well to be bored
I spent Thanksgiving This unexpected five hours, and the airport as our aircraft operated by mechanical problems we had to wait for another aircraft queuing.
I therefore had enough time to me to make a few thoughts on boredom.
I will not lie.
Finding a half a day to wait at the airport on a flight, is quite nervtötend - even when books, magazines and iPhones steuerfreies go shopping) (and, of course, be made available.
But increasingly Kindesentwicklungsexperten lead to academics and boring as something positive.
If it is to them, it is for us, and our children - sometimes seem to be.
That the brain will be forced to lose in interesting considerations, which is perhaps the creativity.
And because most of us, today, almost constantly on one or other to screen the rigid advantages of boredom not more.
Sollten we welcome with open arms the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
I repeat:' come.
Like many people, I am always assumed that relatively topical boredom a phenomenon which has developed more leisure time.
However, Mr Peter Toohey, Professor for Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of 'Boredom: A Yale University (Lively History' Press, 2011), that is not the case.
'In fact the boredom has a very long history, he says.
The fault Hauswände Pompejis Latin on boredom graffiti on the first century.
And then there is the question is, how do we define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, a partner in the university professor of psychology Ontario York, the problem is that, according to many kinds of boredom Canada to be defined and has been discussed.
After long read Forschungsliteratur and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of almost 100 people were Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that, as the experience of boredom 'exercise, a satisfactory result, it does not want to be able to define'.
boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person, but this would not work.
The apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.
The Schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to 'disturbance of Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes slow'.
boredom can listen to this almost as depression.
But, although Professor Eastwood believe these two conditions in relation to people are bored could see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we that is boring us, even if we do not just have to focus.
In their report 'The Unengaged Mind Defining Boredom in terms: Attention' in German, for instance: ``The untätige reason: The definition of boredom in terms of 'attention in September in the journal' Perspectives on Psychological Science 'appeared, Professor out Eastwood, and his colleagues on an earlier experiment in a single volume, the participants to listen to a Magazinartikel read a person.
Some groups have heard a resounding channel from the neighbouring region, which has nothing to do with the content was heard it on others; low noise level, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group is not at all a noise, I heard this.
The people who have heard the barely recognisable television, to try to have more boredom as the other two groups - they had problems to focus, for this could be no reason to their difficulties and wrote the boredom.
If you try to concentrate on a difficult and demanding task could lead to disruption of boredom, Mark says J. Fenske for neuroscience progresses, associative professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, makes for tedious work into 'as the search for defective products on a Fabrikförderband that music bored and can help to feel, not'.
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln Kritzeln and often interpreted as a sign of boredom, this can even be fought by physical persons to be more vigilant.
'studies have shown that children learn herumhampeln Professor more and more than those who are forced to Stillsitzen' Fenske must keep information.
We will, at some point, all wearing my delayed flight - a dröhnender, loudspeakers particularly ermüdender film industry.
But some people bore more easily than others.
In order for these differences, researchers - developed in the 1980s to a' scale Langeweileanfälligkeit '.
Following the statements such as' will find many things that I have to do is repeat and monotonous' and'I have many interests, that I do not have enough time for everything.
help of such scale researchers have discovered that more girls than boys, tedious as Stephen Vodanovich, a professor at the University of psychology Westflorida, in particular, as regards the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli.
But in general are a fairly abgespannter bunch of teenagers.
In 1991, Reed Larson by Professor for human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment where he kontaktierte almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found out that 32% of adolescents in schools and in the homework Erledigen if they were not at school, whereas bored and bored, 23%.
However, only 3% of parents to have to feel bored.
Professor Larson now saying that he does not know whether the exact percentages 21 years later, in terms of boredom have increased or decreased.
He is sure, however, that 'the young people as extremely boring because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their mainly perceived Alltagsablauf.'
Back to my Ursprungsfrage: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, in extreme cases, because it means that people and extreme physical risks to gambling, or drugs, in order to alleviate the studies have shown.
Andererseits many philosophers and authors to examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich the issue of research, for more than two decades.
'With the boredom the brain want to say that we should do something different, Mr Marcus, psychology professor at the University of New York.
But the brain, do not always know what is best in particular.
If a dull and the energy we use to play and to cook Gitarre, you will be happy.
However, in the short term for TV can ensure that these verflüchtigen Glücksgefühle long term, but again.
If his bored child is an iPad, so that it can be diverted from boredom. It has not, however, in order to maintain or to control, Professor Fenske says.
And it also adds that 'self - regulation is a situation of' on the other.
The baby learns, not only to maintain but also in other areas to be more self - regulation.
I do not think we should celebrate boredom.
Even we should not be too critical.
Stattdessen our aim should be to us at ease outside the permanent Aktivitäts and Technologieberieselung.
Professor Eastwood to the vote.
'It sounds as we often have to be boring. But boredom is distressing, relentless desire to do something meaningful', he says.
He believes that the people are in reality, only after a way, to shut down and less so.
'In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to discuss even if the noise is.'
