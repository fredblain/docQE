NASA discovered on the ice Messenger Merkur:
The Messenger is has found evidence that the planet is Merkur ice.
The ice sheet is possibly up to 20 - metre thick.
The agency NASA US-Raumfahrtbeh has shown the existence of ice Merkur on the planet.
Although it is closest to the sun, where there are also water, as from three Fachmagazin on Thursday in Science 'studies published.
The Messenger is found evidence that it constantly in the region of the world, in the shadow of the ice sheet is.
This is at least 30 centimetres, and possibly even up to 20 - metre thick.
The water was probably of comets or perhaps even in the asteroid Merkur are taken.
Nobody the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, in the context of the Messenger-Sonde Chefwissenschaftler said, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in the Merkur can achieve by 426 degrees Celsius.
The Funde could help to clarify, however, such as water and other building blocks of life in other areas are the solar system.

Our insight into space: The main Teleskope
The Teleskop to be invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before it began, Galileo Galilei Sternenbeobachtung to a year later.
Seitdem the mirror the optical Teleskope increasing and the insight that they provide, ever deeper.
30 years of 1947, in 1975 was the Hale-Teleskop Palomar-Observatorium near San Diego the biggest Fernrohr the world.
Der Spiegel, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Telescope Binocular is.
It is right to look into space of two mirror, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The plumbing of Gran Telescopio supporting Kanareninsel of La Palma is the mirror - alone is 10.4 metres in diameter.
Der Spiegel of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented, in order to save costs.
Even so, it achieved a diameter of some 11 000 metres.
The Teleskop is laid down - detriment of the favourable construction, and in his Höhenwinkel in its flexibility.
Even the Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas in Höhenwinkel is fixed.
His characteristic: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This approach is, despite a comparatively low Spiegeldurchmesser - to the world's largest Spiegelteleskope.
With the aid of a Radioteleskops in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers from hearing the space for außerirdischen signals.
The Radioteleskop has a diameter of 305 metres.
In it the 'for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ' (SETI) every Computerbesitzer can help by Rechenleistung it is available.
on the European health observatory Sternwarte (ESO or Chilenischen) in the Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope - that is, all his behalf.
With its total of four which can also mirrors Fernrohr ausleuchten Infrarotspektrum the average.
Ebenfalls to the Chilean ESO-Observatorium the European Large Telescope Extremely is planned.
His Hauptspiegel hefty should include the 42, and almost 1 000 metres from Spiegelelementen be put together.
It is to be expected at the images and 2018.
Until 2007 were the two Keck-Teleskope on the hawaiianischen volcano Mauna Kea, as the largest in the world.
two mirror provide you with an average of 10 metres.
The Keck-Teleskope Mauna-Kea-Observatoriums are part of, among them the IRTTF Subaru-Teleskop and which looks in the sky.
Even in the Mauna Kea a new, huge Teleskop is - with a Spiegel-Durchschnitt of 30 metres.
Here it is on a single incident at to.
The main impressions from the All this, however, provides Hubble Weltraumteleskop.
Since the 24 April 1990 it already provides pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Weltraumteleskop Kepler extrasolaren planet - looking, especially for those who are.
On 2 February 2011 was announced that the Nasa 1235 Planetenkandidaten Missionsbeginn been identified.
In the last Startvorbereitungen have been documented on Weltraumteleskop Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) until 2018 will be fired on board a Ariane5-Rakete into space.

One of the tasks of the telescope: It should seek light of the first stars and Galaxien after the big bang.
scientists from the assumption that the South Pole Merkur of the ice.
But there is no reliable data, since the Messenger far closer to the North Pole revolving around the planet.
Radarmessungen have for decades, suggest that the ice Merkur is.
The 2004 Messenger-Sonde - launched the first, which underpins the Merkur - the scientists have certainty.
