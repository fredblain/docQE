is now cause of an AIDS deaths due to late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old, when he was: the inquiry was HIV positive.
'It was as if a bomb stores' he says about the moment, in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent attempts to 'success'.
He hidden it prior to his family.
He decided to have only started his illness and to be informed, and that with such commitment that he has just celebrated its 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest of the hospital patients HIV-Einheit Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which it was after many battles in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the humane Immundefizienz-Virus (HIV), 22 years, since the beginning of the 1990s was difficult to imagine when there were many doubts, few treatment and stigma.
Damals it has itself to adopt the director of a clinic IMSS, the 'because in a dead end.
Damals AIDS synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
But many people are still in hospital, and that none of their disease in which the virus has already caused by their immune system and is exhausted, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the arrival of the AIDS in the world, that is to say the date of the first reported cases of 'the great success today means, the head of the declared HIV-Einheit HCG, Jaime Villanueva Andrade, in which he said that the information that the survival of a patient who starts on time the treatment, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same in April of this year, a reputable scientific publication has been based.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV\/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva by the scientists, that since 2008 schlussfolgerten that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of life of the degree of prejudice to the immune system depended the people at the start of the treatment, and that would have a greater chance of those which are not end up to 30 years in a sort of 200 CD4 and 50 years, in a sort of 500 CD4:.
Einfach said that the above, mean that, in the age of 25 who receives the diagnosis HIV positive here can easily be 75 years of age, as long as it is under control, this expert said.
In order to be able to operate properly, this progress must be reminded of the fact that, on average, the life expectancy of the Mexicans today six years.
) has reduced the number of people dying of AIDS cases of 6.678 4.862 in 2007 to the year 2011 (annual ONUSIDA), it is nevertheless true that since the appearance of the AIDS that 60% of the national database patients Even if the mortality rate recorded in recent years has significantly reduce (have died in Mexico.
The mere Jalisco in the year 2011 255 people died, and until the month of May this year there are, however, already assured 187 deaths, since 2005, there is universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- Why is, people still die?
In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
at least in the last 12 years, we have had no problems in the medicines. The problem is that the people in an advanced status far, because they do not know its Infektionszustand very late stage, in other words the disease.
He makes a resounding message:' Nine really do represent 10 patients come to us if they already have a sense of infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why all the people, where this is necessary, must be offered a screening tests'.
This proposal to vote in favour of the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (Committee on the State of Jalisco AIDS-Vermeidung) and patients as Fabrizio, the test was carried out in a private laboratories, for the sole reason that it is a friend of the young age, despite its AIDS-Phase was already and even had the tumour krebsartigen Kaposi-Sarkom (a), which is the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and do not want to hear.
'If I have to die, three times, it says' burst in my case.
The amendment was to improve, as I am, that drives ernähre good sport and take note of the medicines.
Today only his parents know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, as everyone else.
'I am working for, a past, have an active and responsible Sexleben, I respect to my health and the other person ', Fabrizio to the agreed, to share with its intimate details JALISCO MILENIO with his testimony to those who are today in the context of global AIDS-Tages afraid to encourage.
You should make the test, if they are used for risk they know whether you are HIV positive, and the sooner the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how, as everyone can live in a responsible manner.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and large holes in the street, Ricardo Salazar said, a journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV has adopted.
And the prevention is the most important thing.
An the certain places' the distribution of condoms actually been increased; previously they individually, but now they have been made to provide us with a hundred of packages, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom ', he said.

'What do you need the' is a widespread Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal, social workers, employees in pharmacies in schools and in the health service, the young people do not want to expose the correspondent assured.
He proposed, before these inefficient; the new distribution of condoms are not just behind the counter, but in Ausgabegeräten in public toilets of institutions, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted the promiscuity.
It should not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio González, in response to the question of whether, under his administration condoms would be distributed.
