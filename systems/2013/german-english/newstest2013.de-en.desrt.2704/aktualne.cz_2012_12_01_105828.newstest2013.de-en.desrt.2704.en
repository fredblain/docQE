NKÚ - head: control of Schwarz-Systems by the failed policy
the Czech Republic has, in relation to public contracts, have good control bodies and adequate legislation, however, is in its application.
In conversation. cz Aktuálně to say this to the Vice - President of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, Miloslav Kala NKÚ).
'A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I believe that that is not the case of' Kala commented on the current situation.
On a similar result also seems to be a common control by Czech and the German auditors.
The negative Praxisbeispiel it leads to the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so - called ``Schwarz-System '.
Unlängst the Prime Minister said that the ODS hector the entrepreneurs with them or not, the system is now would be banned?
must have a valid law, and if something is prohibited by law, but it is not simply the Regierungsvorsitzende, and hinder the surveillance office, whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law in its activity Kala notes.
At the sitting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common tschechisch-deutsches project, in the framework of the legislation on public contracts were both countries compared with each other.
Worum was because in practical terms?
There is a parallel with the review of some two years ago we started.
Vereinfacht said, it is important that the European legislator lays down, public contracts are to handle the national legislation on:'.. And finally, there is the real practical application.
This all we have gathered, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have seen is extremely interesting differences. It is generally said that the laws are we are perhaps even a little 'strict and perfect, but the real application in Germany is better in some parameters.
That confirms that we must always look at it again with the new and more precise rules to establish proper application of the law, is not enough.
to what extent you the project can be a help for you? What emerges from this project?
That is precisely such a joint control could contribute to this, that we must stop constantly seeking to perfecting the laws and the lowering of thresholds, and balancing if it is apparently not very good.
efficiency means to acquire a matter of excluding and at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) illegitimate wealth or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts cannot guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even the case that we are a burden on the system in this way with excessive paperwork 'only' and those who seek to exploit loopholes in the system, the system simpler than the threshold values have remained higher.
you talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.
As the system works in Germany?
Is there a similar body here as our NKÚ, or the system operates in a different way?
What concerns the authorities, it is the German equivalent NKÚ the Federal Audit Office, which is similar to what we have built up and also by a college, that will only be set up in a slightly different way. In principle, however, the two authorities are working.
Even the competences are comparable to a certain extent, and Germany is, however, a federal state, in other words that there are these courts of auditors in the individual states, the German system is different from our own.
The federal funding only BRH must control, which is in line with our public funds.
Public funds are managed by the districts and communities, there will be subject to the control of Landesrechnungshöfe.
What concerns the German legislation, is the easier than ours?
What I would like this without any definite indications only Nichtsdestoweniger Germany, in some respects, is often described as a model, but we certainly cannot say that Germany in particular, is better.
Liegt that, perhaps, that the auditors are better?
That certainly not, but as I have said, which I do not particularly like to make comparisons.
Hierzu that those countries which for us are a model, also with the problems it is facing.
If this were not the case, it would not be true cooperation with our authority, not?
What concerns the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority had Vergabegesetzes of the amendment, you have any consequences?
In view of the fact that these amendments only a short time in force, it is not yet in our assessments.
Since our controls take place later, we must here with a degree of delay.
feel we have so far been rather in the preparation of future controls, we have introduced the new instrument of control and identification of risks of 'waste' in this almost 14, public procurement - examined and analysed the amendments will have an impact, of course, as the thresholds, the conditions for certain types of invitations to tender, among other things, have been modified
Can you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think and hope that this law is a step in the right direction that confirms this assumption.
It can, however, the problem is that the rules will be strict 'and' can no longer be respected.
Right from the previous rules, a verification unterzogenen people are against the agencies (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) to be accountable, so that any failure to respect the Vergabegesetzes a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it sensible, however, then we have to make the law?
In my opinion, it is not this way.
The system must exclude and those who want to abuse the system, and not penalise those who have made a formal errors, not on the actual decision - making.
A system is only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the solution?
we say, first of all, what is not good.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS lay not entrepreneurs with controls of the so - called ``Schwarz-Systems' - what exactly does this mean?
Is this now or permitted Schwarz-System banned?
A law must, however, have its period of validity, and if something is prohibited by law, but it is not simply the Regierungsvorsitzende and impede the surveillance office, whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law, in his work.
He can say: ``We amend the law and allow the matter, but he could not say that we would be as if nothing to do.
It contains a relatively strict rules on procurement law which owes much to the formal out certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also a tragedy if the offeror with the best offer Formfehlern solely on the grounds of being excluded.
The law never will be perfect, but it must be applied properly, and that is what I think is missing.
