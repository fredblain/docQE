'The brain is so far only moderate' dupe those
The supporters of modern technologies in popular subject of the enlarged reality is usually recently through the lens of a specific perspective.
Firstly, in the summer, Google, at its annual meeting in November, a working model was then known that Microsoft had declared an adequate patent.
In talks with the head of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in Microsoft-Labor in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, is clear that the prism of the scientists of the company was only a staging post.
you anew the opportunity to manipulate and virtual property with their bare hands in the air to create virtual Freiflächen.
- you Beschreiben short, what research your group.
We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to extend the limit of this interaction.
No humanity is largely remained stuck in the period in which to work with Pixeln preferably, sometimes be affected.
We, however, look to foresee 5 -10 years and the radical changes to this interaction.
Beispielsweise the Xbox-Konsole Kinect-Sensoren are a step forward, and nowadays Xbox will no longer be sold Kinect, since all the interested for Bewegungssteuerung.
What we have in the future?
Kinect - Although the interaction of a physical level, a great deal has to play in the Flachbildschirm, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We are trying to change the working, on real three - dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the Computerwelt in our physical world and comprehensible.
The same applies, however, it is important that not only the users, but also its surroundings.
Then we could add to the real world of virtual objects much easier.
And these bescheuerten Virtual-Reality-Helme, first and foremost, we should be starting to happen.
What do you think about Sprachsteuerung -?
is liked you, but they will not be exaggerated.
- it is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, since it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always Umstehenden all information about his actions and intentions.
Eigentlich any kind of interaction with computers, however, is any good, in their specific detail.
For example, we were working in the field of governance of objects in public places to a project in which we, with short and limited, rather than ausladenden experimentierten gestures.
Let the gestures were recorded Objektkamera not by the Council, but by a Armband, the registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
As it is a relatively large, could in theory be reduced to the size of a wristwatch, however.
But overall, the future belongs to, for example, joint Steuerungstypen Gestik and language.
- As this?
We would like to ask you - for example, to offer you these Sprudeldose?
you to say it and, at the same time.
I am normally simply.
- well, that would be very difficult to understand.
- the Heißt, you want the users adapt to what a machine can make the relevant time and what is not?
- It is not important, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I believe that in the next period, in particular, to the development of new types of the responses to enable more people to work.
That can be Lasersensoren for example in the depth, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
What you are basis of your work with the demands of modern cameras Xbox Kinect-Sensoren?
Mangelt of disintegration, or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of the three - dimensional detection.
Of course Megapixel 8 would be at a rate of one thousand fps not bad.
However, the main not Megapixel which are themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
However, all the current technologies are not good enough, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It is not only the disbanding along the X, Y and - but also along the Z-Achse be taken into account.
Even the speed, and the number of a second images are important.
The movements of people are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps in particular gestures are too little.
Stephen Betishes in our developed in a laboratory Redmond Berührungssensor with a regulierbaren Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 -100 Millisekunden, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 and 100).
Not all understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
To my work I had only just such an instrument without Berührungssteuerung and with more pictures per second.
- will increase the number of cameras Müsste not?
- Kinect is currently working with three 'cameras ', but one of them actually a Infrarotsender and the second is a recipient of the date, signal.
And the third is indeed a camera ordinary RGB-Kamera.
you is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe.
More cameras may be able to solve the problem.
Oder compound the problem, because more calculations are necessary.
system would be a flexible, check Kinect - similar in which we could play with various Kameraneigungen to see us, as in the case of the three - dimensional identifying a position to provide help.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, in contrast to his glasses Google not the public.
thinking you not think that, as regards the use of technology in the everyday reality of the enlarged glasses, the best prospects?
Of course, it is not always pleasant, on their way to keep in the hands of a smart phone, but I believe the following: The tollste formula would be an 'rotating' enlarged reality, in which we have a cloud of the prism of the smart phone, could switch
The impact is a personal 'gadget' and its strength lies (private you can see only), but also, at the same time its weakness: an enlarged reality through wear glasses that you, together with others to virtual objects able to work.
- posts before us a moment that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air from not only Mr Stark Iron Man, but also Normalsterblichen is accessible.
There is a problem, to the critics often this idea: There is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing!
What answers to give your group on this point?
- In my lectures I often talk about the importance of the extended reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of taktilen perception.
An interesting method currently use of second - hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.
you true takes pressure excellent.
There are, however, also technologies which are actually designed to 'pictures in the air ', something concrete to, for example, the number of collisions Ultraschallstrahlen aimed at a certain point, the finger is a feeling that at the moment, but so is weak, as someone Handballen pustete on.
It also ties to the Commission on the Nervenendungen in the fingers of one hand, this is also a possible way.
Have you tried to dupe those, the brain?
There I think that what the European Union should see it, if it is just a little?
- This is a good idea, so we still have not tried it.
Here is another task with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely a person physically in a closed area, to believe that he was instead in an open, virtually never - ending area; we are working on concepts with Laufbändern (other than in gyms too), mobile platforms and major bullets.
No, the brain, and only moderately dupe those before us for many years of hard work for.
That is precisely the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher rather this: In many issues we are only just beginning.
