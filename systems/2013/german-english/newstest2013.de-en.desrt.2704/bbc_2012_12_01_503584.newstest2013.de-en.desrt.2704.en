Aktuell transport is particularly bad in Mexico City.
Even for better days ago, this is always a clogged city, but on Monday was created as a ring of steel, the absperrt and several important routes in the capital is causing havoc on the roads.
The aim, however, it was not to disrupt commuters are on their way to work, but to stop demonstrators, to achieve this Parliament.
On Saturday Präsidentenbinde of Mexico and the new President will receive Enrique Pena Nieto take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderons Mexico is economically has to prove its worth, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, in the last six years, has already led to 60 000 lives.
'My government is strongly committed to the violence, to reduce Pena Nieto stated earlier this week in the Oval Office the US President Barack Obama.
I intend to propose a new security strategy, with which we can achieve this objective.

He is a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, above all, it was also someone who can hear.

In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast could be paved roads of the brilliant del Valle not growing.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of itself.
And the problems in the municipality of urban nature are crucial.
Earlier this year, the military was involved in the neighbourhoods in order to combat drug gangs operating, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
At a wasteland spots in the vicinity of a large landfill in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind.
During the period of the State Governor Pena Nieto - Mexico over 1, 000 women were murdered a statistic, which exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez for their violence and the killing of innocent women is well known.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that it is not appropriate to address the problem of the murders of women during his term of office.

'But that is not possible, if there were so many flaws and shortcomings, it says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday he receives Präsidentenbinde which will also have a great responsibility.
Mexican tens of thousands of families have been learned in the last six years of violent crime, and the new President has promised during his term of office, particularly to this problem.
'I hope, as President, it is true, as he was governor, which says' PRI-Kongressabgeordnete Olvera in Valle's del well done.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
