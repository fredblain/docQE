The Higgs-Boson analysed
The announcement of the discovery of the probable Higgs-Bosons has aroused last summer a certain, and for good reason.
We believe, in fact, that this Boson nothing for the majority of all the issues in the universe, less than the mechanism is involved
And finally, this is the last of the particles, whose existence of the standard model, our best or the least 'wrong' explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter, empirically, but still not been observed.
But for the physicist it is still not entirely sure that it is really the Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we have a genuine new particles and that the predicted by the standard model Higgs-Boson very similar.
I also believe this to be confirmed by the new data in this week on a major Physik-Kongress were presented in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data, in order to be completely safe.
from walking, we nevertheless, that this is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low level of risk, and what we are looking to us.
There is in this world a crucial law, which inevitably means that two objects the same place at the same time not able to be present.
It is not possible to keep to this rule - and you are not too much, because you will try to hurt.
Because even if the particle physics one world really odd that, for them, also proposed such a law, which states: Ausschlussprinzip Pauli is true that two particles not fill the same place at the same time, when they are in the same 'Quantenzustand', and the 'state' by and large there is for some of their characteristics.
Davon the share a physicist the particles into two categories.
In a corner, the good of the citizens, be described as Fermione and lastly the Pauli-Prinzip.
And on the other, the Bosonen a nasty gang of anarchists nothing sacred, which is in any case not of this principle, which means that they are in fact the same place at the same time can.
This divide Bosonen on the website The Particle Adventure of the laboratories Berkeley (which, incidentally, is absolutely remarkable) into two groups: the Mesonen we are not to be treated and the 'Kraftteilchen' by the spread and the major forces of nature with Higgs-Boson in a way which would be used.
It must be stressed, however, that these Bosonen not all such as it could be exotic are creatures.
If you are able to read this story, then, just a mediocre Bosons of exceptional: the Photon Lichtteilchen 'or' the ``is' boats the electromagnetic force.
If that is an unimportant or accelerated change in the direction of an electrical goods' the electromagnetic fields is disturbed precisely in this place, such as' in a pebble, who was thrown into a pond where.
Indeed, these ``disturbance " (an electromagnetic waves, infrared light or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a Photon Bosonen and therefore one of the`` bearer of force '.
Stabileres field
the same goes for the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another area that Higgs-Feld 'must' be disrupted, so that this Boson.
But Higgs-Feld which is much more stable than the electromagnetic fields; the pathogen should achieve very high energy, a bit like a frozen pond where its functions only by a very large rocks zerfurcht could be.
And it is a huge Teilchenbeschleuniger like CERN necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km, in order to achieve this type of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic fields is helpful to explain once again, the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It has not, in fact, all the particles are and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic fields.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not, for example, would never be a piece of paper in the refrigerator.
And just as not all of the particles interact with the Higgs-Feld: those who do it, have a majority, while the other (like the Photon) have no mass.
For what all these research can now be 'good' woman wondering Plamondon?
For it is the science of the review of the standard passenger data model (SM), and they allow the Physikern also to examine all the differences between the observations and the predictions of SM.
There are also numerous physicist, the hope that, since such exceptions are the slightest difference and plug open a door to a new 'physics some gaps, the model.
You must say that the latter still major deficiencies, because it offers no explanation for the gravity - ups (!) and of the dark ca. issue that 80% of the subject matter of the universe!) (once again - ups.
But not in CERN such derogations have been found by now.
impact
The effects of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no.
main issues here have thought: are the pioneers of Lasers in the Bell-Laboren that their work in the early 1960s would give rise to such a revolution.
you saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have invented the late physicist Boyle Willard has already said - in the Bell Sail Labs complex has worked in which the lasers in the 1960s, which has been developed since 1962 and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (the first gepulst) has been - that the lasers, at the beginning, rather than an 'Laborspielerei was considered.
posts before you...
can also be applications but also for all the instruments that surrounded the research.
Beispielsweise small Lichtsensor Willard Boyle has developed in 1969, during its work in the optics.
Although it is not the original purpose of this carrier was all digital cameras today throughout the world as the 'eye' and has brought him the Nobel Prize for 2009 physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of our life LHC necessarily change but it does mean that we really know it can never...
