'PSG is not the moment Barcelona!'
In this season PSG you have adopted with a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
You can say it with a personal view, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
significance are players.
Täglich I make progress on their side.
The technical staff has also been much.
These elements to spur me to do this on a daily basis, to improve my Spielniveau.
And in a game that is simpler than that.
In football everything is very quickly.
But I am not from breche in enthusiasm.
Since my earliest days of the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my Spielzeit in gradually Saint-Etienne I have always made progress.
you by Carlo Ancelotti therefore compete with imported from...
The addition of this summer are used to the Olympics, with a very high level.
you also know that any Trainingseinheit is crucial.
This means that a player, as I must be inventive and its very best wishes.
Carlo Ancelotti main issues here have much to me in relation to my Spielposition.
He is supported by Co-Trainern as Claude Makelele, as I was in the same position.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti a cause for all the technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and it is one of the best trainers of Europe.
He will look back on a rich experience and has won many title with eminent clubs.
He had contact with major players.
I think that it will be further title in Paris.
In January, I had a good discussion with him.
Damals I had just recovering from a Verletzungsserie.
The confidence that he has placed in me, is also an explanation of my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the Spitzenreiters us.
We lurk in ambush, however.
Champions League is one of our most important objectives: we have qualified for us in this way the Achtelfinale.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We will try to come, as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
But we are against a very good European crews to have our say.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in Porto, so that we take the Achtelfinales Heimspiel as the return leg.
Will the PSG be in the short term, a great European club?
He has already for the budget.
For Europe to be a big club, must gain and Paris is entitled to make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
Finanziell PSG of the funds so that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it not be a big failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as in the last season was the case?
Of course this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is truly committed to cream off, this title.
In the last season we were close off.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to embrace the victory.
We have reached the end of the season, with a very significant achievement.
We have concluded with 79 points.
should normally be master with 79 points...
However, those of another team, has achieved a better season.
I believe that this is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseilles I believe - Lyon - Bordeaux or the stuff that we have to gain the title, struggling
thinking that the media, you expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been spent and the players that we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept that.
If, however, we are against a Heimspiel Troyes 4-0, and it is still what we have to do something, we can say with certainty, which is somewhat frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We can never win every weekend 4-0 with.
We are not the moment Barcelona.
We are trying to set an Spielkonzept.
A team building at the time.
In the Champions League, we have demonstrated our strength.
Manchester City looking to you, a combination of the two Saisons unable, to qualify for the Achtelfinale, and has also made huge expenditure.
In view of the sums invested it was believed you to Spielpause ahead with 15 points.
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would ignore.
Lyon and Marseilles, the last season was not good geboostet 'of this new PSG'.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we, in the month of May will be the winner smiling and tell us that we finally, they have gained, despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the services provided.
In order that it better Zlatan-Abh 'independence'.
That means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and too many goals.
And he has come and it shows that it is the 'Star the Ligue 1.
Überall where he has played, it has led to great a player and that he is a world star with respect.
Within the team we respect both the players and the person.
He also respect the people who surround it.
What he has done is exceptional.
This helps to improve their Spielniveau the others.
Thiago Silva, the world is one of the best defenders, will make it possible for all the others, also to make progress.
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
It was very important to me, to the Euro.
Unfortunately my violation has also prevented Spielzeit something.
I saw things that emerged strengthened from which I am.
Today, we will be able to achieve good Games in the national football team.
This has, since I had with the 'Bleus' my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must behave in an exemplary manner in the day.
What do you have to consider the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the 'Bleus'?
He has achieved positive results.
We have a good position in the Qualifikationsgruppe for the World Cup.
The Austrian national coach is strictly, is close to the players and encourages on his victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc tragedy.
But I do not want to make any comparison.
Blanc has to be achieved by giving us for the Euro was qualified.
I hope that the 'Deschamps Didier Bleus' will lead to Brazil.
Stellt that on 16 October in Spain in a forced latched Auftaktspiel (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar line in my career.
