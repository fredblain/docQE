Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland has been received with him on the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a member of this space body zwanzigstes. Poland is the second Member State from the former Eastern bloc countries (to the Czech Republic, that on 12 November 2008 was ESA-Mitglied).
Poland in 1994 close cooperation began with the ESA and participated in the following years in several ESA-Projekten.
The path of Poland in the space of course, start much earlier.
The very before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte are employed in the space sector, but they were not always easy to understand.
I recall, for example, of the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw observatory, in which the author of its pioneering ideas presented Kosmonautik included 'to'.
The ideas of the young engineer. 1905) (and the people were, however, and following years, only Šternfeld that Dr Jan Gadomski shown interest in his work has reminded us.
Šternfeld won in 1934 Kosmonautik 'for' entrance to the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch gestifteten REP-Hirsch announcing.
Dr Jan Gadomski (he later - 1996) has been an important supporter of astronomy and space industry.
In Polish magazines published and hundreds of articles he wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis of internationally recognised contribution to the development of space has been appreciated by, among other things, that a Krater erdabgewandten on the side of the moon after he was appointed.
Right in the year in Poland in 1925 a Eisenbahn-Draisine was built on a Raketenantrieb was planned.
The author of the text and the details of this project, unfortunately I do not know.
It is not yet clear whether the rocket the brakes or off the Draisine should be used.
The information that come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 to the Polish infantry started raketenbetriebenen with bullets.
The research, the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
is clear that research for the documents provided to the stage of practical tests was.
The research was interrupted by the invasion, of course, then the German.
In the year of 1937 appeared in the press of the message of originating. Rohoziński draft fotoelektrischen Jagdrakete, and the following year, the work was' Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza 'Leliwa-Krzywoblocky of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
short before the war were all projects to military use of the missile technology by the person who was scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of hard work was its work by the end of the war.
Another article appeared after the war, the aerospace and thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first discussion of this takes place in society in 1954 Novemberausgabe Problemy the magazine, in the four major article devoted to the space industry.
The article by Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time, there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the research of space would have a future.
Right in its inception in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA tried to join up to the 1951 International Federation for space travel, and indeed the PTA has already been in the autumn of 1956 proper Member.
In the following year, was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), vice - chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
This office he has been holding up to his death in 1959.
Since the 1956 PTA significantly involved in the development of the most successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type RM-1, which was concluded in 1957, the first start was made on 10 October 1958.
The rockets with a maximum altitude of 1 800 metres around 80 cm was long and weighed not entirely 5 kg.
Später an improved version, which was built RM-1A, in 1959, and started in the test flights Błędów - desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The rocket 1.4 m was long and weighing kg approximately 11.5.
Another development should already be in a position to provide genuine scientific work and the missile RM-34 should achieve an altitude of up to 14.5 km for the monitoring of Höhenwinden.
In 1962, however, the further development has been discontinued.
successor of the first type RM the rockets in 1962 to 1965 Meteor-1-Rakete developed.
The rocket, was conceived Zweistufenrakete than 510 cm was their overall length and the take - off weight was 32 500 kg.
From this missile (Meteor-1A three types have been developed, -1 B -1 and C in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport, with 0.4 litres Meteor-1B on 0,34 litre and Meteor-1C on 0,62 litre.
The maximum altitude, in all three types of 37 km.
In the years to 1968 in the 1965 Luftfahrtinstitut Meteor-2-Rakete has been developed, the first test flights in 1970 began in October.
Meteor-2 had a take - off weight of 380 kilograms, and was able to implement a 10 kg in a level of around 60 km.
after the versions were built Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Erwähnenswert is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, the two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses followed.
Poland participated in the framework of the Interkosmos-Programms also with Soviet satellite in space, and in 1978, was the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut second.
