At our concerts Šimon Ornest: we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world that, in less than a month to take place?
This is one of those Katastrophenmeldungen, to which we are so keen to function.
With our band The Tap Tap we are rather fun and to say that we are the only link to the world of the collecting sufficient positive energy in order to prevent or stop the end of the world, can.
In December, you have kept also a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you imagine our readers to this project?
It is a national Benefizveranstaltung, which we are already two years.
Hierfür we want to use the Marketingpotenzial Maya-Kalenders of the end of the day, is forecast for the 21 December at 11:10 a.m..
The day before, that is, on 20 December, from three organises concerts at 21:00 at the same time take place in Prague and Ostrava Brno.
The end is organises concerts about the time of Kiribati on the Pacific in a zone of 12 hours before us is the Maya-Kalender.
From whom this idea?
My original, then I think we have reached together with the idea of our Grafiker Honza Augusta.
Let us not only to collect sufficient positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, we should also consider, together with the public, but in which we state our children all over the world.
The end of the Maya-Kalenders we have developed a unique range of shoes, T - shirts, pockets and Schlüsselanhängern against the end of the world, with whose purchase on www.e-tap.cz we can also support the people.
The band The Tap Tap has begun, together with other actors also the so - called national anthem against the end of the world with the title 'statements from is'.
The very today the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also being proposed in the Benefizkonzerten?
Of course, at the very end, provided that all the work and the end of the world is not taking place.
The hymn sung by all actors to be at all three concerts at the same time.
the anthem also be broadcast live together in a Direktschaltung the Czech television.
The text of the anthem was played by Tomáš Hanák, the main character of Jesus in Videoclip Xindl X, with is...
As you have come to the cooperation with the two?
We also cooperate with other people, the Czech Kulturszene connected with that we implement many Benefizveranstaltungen organises concerts and...
We are trying to involve those people involved in the projects.
affair has shown that most to cooperate with us and are keen to have fun.
Welchem purpose of the proceeds, organises concerts benefit against the end of the world?
For the creation of integrated Bildungszentrums Studeo we already six years, together with the club Tap Jedlička Institute in - work.
The students - regularly Jedlička Institute of teachers, with the help of various leisure activities.
Since the pupils themselves do not have the resources to go before the assistants, we would like to help them in this way.
In the completion of a separate institute Jedlička - building in which we have to work with this project.
At each stage of several groups and the interpreters.
After what criteria you have chosen this?
We wanted to put together a programme, which addresses all the generations, including children.
In Prague Chinaski, for example, to support, with Dan Lesbiens Illustratosphere Bárta The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All you will be further www.kpks.cz on the website.
Are similar 'events have also planned for the future?
In May we come to the Prague Spring, for the first time, and also for this project, we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
next year, we also want to be held in New York in the Czech Parliament, and I personally - if we then in the United States, this would also have liked to have a link with interventions in Washington and Chicago.
your Auslandspläne are not just small, you have been so far in Madrid, London, Brussels or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the logistical and organisational travel?
It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the Gepäckraum transported in wheelchairs, we must also, of course, many Instrumentenkoffer must haul and luggage...
Nevertheless it has worked to date without its problems, and British Airways ČSA were always prepared to us very well that I have already partly I am sometimes surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Indeed, you have your travel as a comparison, in the various countries with accessibility is, how it is dealing with disabled people, etc.
As you have seen these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other towns and cities where everything works better than us in Russia, we have just seen that in the East, everything is still in its infancy.
confrontation Prague Moscow is absolutely not accessible, it is still unusually, if someone using a wheelchair, is alone in the city centre.
It is not, of course, that we have a wheelchair users in the lift vorlässt, for example.
terms Fortunately, there are also the clubs try to address the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many issues where we are lagging behind.
The same applies, that is an improvement but it also depends on the situation and the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid it is perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities are self - employed in the public sphere, museum, use the toilets can move, etc.
It is not just that there is a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in the public arena, we are ahead with the band The Tap Tap the West is a little.
is public respect - and one thing, but only when a change from the ranks of the important things are really start, athletes, artists and actors, to be politicians or lawyers.
So far these are only individual cases of particularly willensstarken figures.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, however. If we go back a couple of years, is motivated to you: What has happened in 1998, to set up a bond?
I went to Damals Jedlička as carers, the Institute, where I met many young people who were keen to deal with something.
And since I myself am a Musik-AG Saxofon and musicians and I have established, together with a colleague.
Na, and in time, that is, as our facilitator, Láďa Angelovič, tends to say, somewhat out of control (laughs).
Volume Bekannt but which was only in recent years, or are we not?
It is true that the cooperation with also well - known Sängern we have started to have also helped; actively for us.
We are aware of the fact that it has become rather, and this is not to see the merit, in some sense, does not exist.
Thanks to the EU, we can make our good teachers and high - quality products, and so on.
War, it aims to get it with The Tap Tap?
From the start, I have heard the potential that we can tackle the situation is different.
In the branch of show business today that is often one of the other.
This is logical, on its way with caution, because anything new only after a long time, and will be accepted.
There are only a few things that are truly unique and, I would venture to claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the public has often, there is, of course, and this is only natural.
But this sympathy is totally superfluous, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned we would regret that.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities, something that is not only to themselves is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
War for this success is also useful that you are strictly a head, as we heard from many people?
If you want to make something good, we should not make any compromises on many things, and must also demand a certain degree of discipline.
This is, I think, but completely normal.
Some come to us with a romantic ideas, and then, when they see that they have twice a week, to undertake stages and spend a lot of time on the enthusiasm, sponsoring concert tours then many of them quickly.
This is how it works but everywhere, in every bond, the serious work and wants to achieve something.
A The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were from the outset, namely that since 1998?
Just one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. The one can prevent.
Who has the will and the desire to contribute, is always welcome.
