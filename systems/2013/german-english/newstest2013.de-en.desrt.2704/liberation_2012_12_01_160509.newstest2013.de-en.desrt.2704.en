Regarding the surprise of all he has delivered on the Wednesday of the constituent assembly, the next day will adopt its final version.
It is just a week ago, the Head of State has given to this House the two more months to complete its work.
Egypt is now for nearly two years ago, in a provisional text amended several times, which weakens and institutional stability leads to a legal confusion.
