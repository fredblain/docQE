"The great and powerful leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While Members of Parliament and civil rights activist discuss the usefulness of the law on binding language tests for immigrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers to come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which each working immigrant must pass a test, the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far this provision applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests with the time, according to federal immigration authority should be in the future for all guest workers on duty.
We must not only language tests, but also take tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language must be demonstrated both for the conservation, as well as the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions only for citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
It is also exempt from this law, people who receive their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The problem, and the protection of the rights
The whole of the review will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian language, St. Petersburg of the Russian University of Friendship, the Moscow State University, the State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can put the tests in all the cities; now in Russia were already more than 160 center opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal immigration authority.
On the other hand, human rights activists said prior to the entry into force of the law in the press on a number of occasions the following question: what makes the whole thing?
What changes does the legislation to have language skills, both for the Russians as well as for guest workers?
Above all, spokesman of the migration authorities say, it is trying to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many people are talking about the protection of the rights of migrants," says the head of the representation of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights must be protected, however, already before departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.
On the problems of migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which will put him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he stuck with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home is the one you promised, and they are cheated on arrival, have taken their passports and do not receive the promised pay," the head of the main administration for labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow confirmed.
Rail, chief!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, that they do not control not only the language of the country, but also in their own language hardly can express in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their debt, rather than the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford only a sound basic education.
Because, in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager then these children to take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language," they admit.
"You still feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activist in terms of the law following an important aspect.
The test only migrants must discard with legal status.
You do not have that status, so there is no review and, therefore, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "ban on access for unauthorized"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
You can make a fake registration quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely fabricated, and we are not registered, and then resulting cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow manifests itself against journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers,"
Already on the day on which the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates which certify the completing of the language tests have already been beschlaggenommen by employees of the federal immigration authority.
The fake papers were printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, that the new owners were not in vain: any migrant who hoped to spare the tests to be paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost for the official test: it costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, are united both officers, as well as civil rights activist.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers who fall for the first time by the test, only promise that you will have time for a language course.
In addition, in areas will be newcomers without language, in which no active understanding is necessary with people.
