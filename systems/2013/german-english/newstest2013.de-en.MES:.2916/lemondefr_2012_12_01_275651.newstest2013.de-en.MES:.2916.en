"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain to him through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players are coming.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff gave me too much.
These elements spur me on a daily basis to improve my level of play.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football everything is very quickly.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress gradually.
They are taking advantage of Carlo Ancelotti introduced competition...
The latest games this summer are accustomed to a very high level.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player, like I, must offer the forehead and wants to give his best.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a great deal in terms of my position.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I do.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
As a matter of course.
Jeff inspires respect for all the technicians.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
The confidence that he has put in me, it is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the.
But we are lurking in the ambush.
The Champions League is one of our most important objectives: we have qualified us in this way for the eighth finals.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we are going to talk with against a very good European teams have our say.
First, we want to be the first of our group, Porto, so that we can carry out the return leg of the Achtelfinales as home game.
The PSG can be in the short term, a major European club?
He has already been the budget...
In order to be a great European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Weld together the resources so that this project takes concrete forms.
It would be a big failure, not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really at the heart of this title.
In the last season, we were informed.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to cope with the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has had an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In the light of what has been invested, and the players that we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we can win in a home match against Troyes 4-0, and it is still a little place, what they accuse us, and that is certainly a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to make a game concept.
A team builds up with the times.
In the Champions League, we have proven strength.
You look at Manchester City, a club of the past two seasons failed to qualify for the eighth finals, and which has made huge expenditure.
In terms of the sums invested believed you to break with 15 points ahead.
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup would ignore.
Geboostet, Lyon and Marseille, who were in the last season of this new PSG were not good. "
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, smiling winner, and we say that we have finally won, despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many goals.
That is why he is coming, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he has played, he has led in mind that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This stimulates the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all the others, in order to make progress.
How do you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was to take part in my heart, at the European Championships.
Unfortunately, something has to beat my injury prevented from playing time.
I saw things, from which I am emerged stronger.
Today, I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
Since this was my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what occurred in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must put an exemplary behaviour on the day.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strictly, is close to the players and stimulates the victory.
It was, as well as Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal, he had qualified for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" after Brazil.
On 16 October in Spain, forced draw (1: 1) a game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.
