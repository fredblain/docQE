Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to his office, he wants to grant analyzed by the BBC, the challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
The traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring built from steel, blocking off several major transport routes in the capital and on the roads for chaos.
The goal, however, it was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but also to prevent protesters trying to reach Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Präsidentenbinde and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon, Mexico can prove economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week the U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy, which we will be able to achieve this goal.
Before he went with the US president at eye level, Pena Nieto was working as governor of his home state Mexico.
In this densely populated part of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo remembered, for example, would like to him.
Residents of the resort to write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can ride on one of the highways, Pena Nieto, who represent a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy streets that were once again.
With his name plaques hanging outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes" to him, his friend and political ally Gabriel LAX Nietos Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards the security and the economy, we hope to an interesting and real change that our country desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI has been replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman LAX admits that the party after 12 years out of the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view on their former governor.
Subsequently, also known as Ciudad neza, the contrast could not be greater on the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo.
The place is hidden under highway on guided tours and represents, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems are in the municipality of urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military has been switched to combat the drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a wasteland in the vicinity of a large landfill sites the corpses of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years.
During the term of governor Pena Nieto Mexico have been murdered in the state of more than 1,000 women - a statistic that exceeds even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killings of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is not adequately addressed the problem of feminicide during his tenure, to say the least.
But, in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical for the run-down district, fights Irinea Buendia with the tears when they showed me photos of their deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life partner.
"When I arrived at their home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the body had already used.
While her mother tells her story, an image of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is right next to a cross, which bears a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, you have denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me when I was a humbug, troublemakers, whingers.
You just want that we accept their verdict and the mouth.
"But that is not possible, if there were so many errors and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto Präsidentenbinde on Saturday, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to care during his tenure to this problem.
"I hope that, as president, he is so, as he was as a governor," says the PRI Congressman LAX in Valle del Bravo.
But it is precisely be afraid of the families of the victims in Ciudad neza most.
