Héctor "Hetin," Reyes: "basketball was my life '
The globalization of the sport, Héctor "Hetin," Reyes, the basket was more than 60 years and has traveled around the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of the history of the city of the country such as Héctor "Hetin," Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, Rexes was 6 years, part of this sport, either as a player lower classes, the first National League player, agent and manager in the BSN with the vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My life I have put myself in the basketball many hats, even more at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," he remembered Reyes during a visit from Primera Hora Bayamón at home, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
Almost all the walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify.
In the heart of Bayamón
The emotionalsten memories are those who remember his time at the vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player in 1982, where he celebrated his fifteenth anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or director of the club.
"That was my best years that I have enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships of the vaqueros since 1967, as CEO, Mitgeschäftsführer or trainer.
There were many years, including five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy BSN.
Then took "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "Reyes says.
I do know that genes Bartow, who worked as a trainer here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was given to me, said: "I have a very strong and 2 m big players.
Do you want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had ever Puerto Rico.
Raymond Gausse Bartow recommended after the free throw specialists, and one of our best shooter.
I know, even as he said that, if Mincy allows for a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another.
The championship of the vaqueros with Gausse was granted, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the Association in 1988.
At that time he preferred it to enjoy its executions and Mincy's in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the upcoming tournament in Mexico against the United States.
After the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, what should have been, if not repeat this Canadian referee would have left us in the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
This group of the World Cup in 1990 was the best national team that you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won the Olympics in 2004 against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and the team of the US offered a fight against us, as when they won bronze at the World Cup.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be here in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, with which we won a gold medal and caused us great joy, was that of the upcoming tournament in 1995), Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of what happened at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We have had a number of good coach Julio Toro, Flor, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, the work of Leo Arill strikes me well.
What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of national team from 1988 to 1995, which encompassed the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in a season.
What remains to be done to you?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The fact that the guys in Ponce, for example, only play in your area, and only in the national teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children needlessly make many trips and games.
At least I see the result of mandatory training and courses for trainers, contracts officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I would like to listen to music, see YouTube videos of music in my time, I enjoy my grandchildren and to go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
