"The people that I want to save the republic, but I am just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how the idea to stand for the office of president?
It is not my intention to be a senator or president.
If everything would work in our country without any problems, I would stand anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves, will be increased during the people, taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But when I see what I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I'm already over 40, and independent and party, I have no other way to influence things, rather than to run for senator or president.
They have succeeded in the Senate and then straight on the road to the castle.
They would not return to their voters back?
I told myself all the time that I am going to take the fight to the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later I made it and said that I am going to run for the office of president, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function of the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I do not need as much influence and a strong mandate as possible.
However, the problem is not only that we rail as people in the pub, and in front of the TV, but anyone who wants to make the change.
The media who want to rob an honour, and confusing to lie the freedom of speech with freedom.
For example, has been said about me, that I would bribe journalists or that I was consultant from JIRÍ Paroubek.
We are talking about their visions.
The battle for the castle, they have taken with the idea of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retrospective asset declarations about 20 million kroner.
To do this, you need to change the laws.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have argued that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it will be rejected, and that keeps the population.
As an independent party I have a much greater potential to win support for all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of each party, which is the best for our country.
They see themselves as a human being in politics rather than right or left?
From the point of view of Czech, it seems to me that the people see me more to the left.
For me, this right left thinking, however, is totally unimportant.
For me, it is important that we can move forward.
For me, it is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or to the right, I would like to connect the people.
I always publicly support every good approach, even if it comes from, or from the Czech Republic, and I shall also speak against bad ideas.
It is not like you, if someone calls you as populists.
But they do not confirm what you have just said?
If you are a company in a business plan, then you also have an ideal destination and a vision.
And that you are approaching.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken, already work in the world, or they have been discussed by experts.
But without support in Parliament keywords.
And so you come in the policy does not go far in the long term.
Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk with the people who will be able to push through, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
And to try to convince politicians, journalists and the general public, to bring them to our side, to implement these goals.
As President, there would be no problem for me, to ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television, to anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And the raised would have to say why they reject it.
A strong personality, which points to abuses can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, who was an achievement of the public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy I just started and trying to find my program for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the things themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I go back in six years in the private sector.
It sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I am not alone; that is why I have spoken with several well-known personalities whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with, for example, radim Jancura, which refused, however, due to overwork.
In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which uncovered the fraud in the trade, with light heating oil.
My candidacy, I started with the premise that the people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not sure any more.
Sixty percent of eligible voters went to the polls, and those who are mostly gone, have elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are now only two independent.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of the mayor and district of the main men.
You think about the creation of your own party?
I have not yet thought about it, because I don't have time to review the past every potential party member, and also do not have the money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
They have no money?
They talk of assets declarations, how would their?
I value my private assets to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu, which is worth about a million, and then I still have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was, in fact, a children's dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he was in the car drove, Galant to women and, at the same time, fought against evil.
Drive an Aston Martin, have a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that they want to change the Republic, but they do not want to invest their own money.
This is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
I should make some debt?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is probably not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources.
In fact, the cost of the campaign will be covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senator salary alone I could not live; so I could, for example, my son is not the English school funding, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing.
In other words, they remain more than entrepreneurs, in order to have their livelihoods?
They said that they will not cut back on these activities?
But that does not depend on the level of salary.
As promised, I have reduced some of my activities.
For example, my deputy in spring, CEO of the travel agencies.
The people want to see me as a Good Samaritan, which saves the Republic.
But I must do something.
They were accustomed to monthly income as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is to continue.
As President, I would put my activities, however.
