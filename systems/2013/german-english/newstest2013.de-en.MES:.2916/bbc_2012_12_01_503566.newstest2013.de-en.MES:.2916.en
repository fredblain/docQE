Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe but all over the world.
The secret of the country's success might have something to do with the local appetite rather nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of cheeses.
One place you in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And they leave a week.
So you have to imagine the smell of rakfisk nasenbetäubenden, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which is fermented, depending on how you would like to have his fish stink - up to one year in water.
When the darkness comes in Norway on the country and the weather is colder, Norwegians flock to a very hard here in Fagernes, that is, well, complete with specialty.
"You eat it raw and provides it with an aquavit," Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but also as a so-called "rakfisk General," says the festival.
People eat small fish cubes and make a large amounts of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Harvard.
The liquor can crowd out the smell.
I cost some hors d'oeuvres.
If one is to bring the rakfisk near the nose, he is not a bad thing - such as sushi, which has a long bus ride behind.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and soaked fish in autumn in airtight salt water casks.
In the deepest winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol consumed.
A generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians forced to leave their country in search of work, and mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, which was still not too long ago, much richer than Norway, immigrants flows.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy here.
But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a whopping 10 euros.
Norway often failed in the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here are still hates it, to name Anders Breivik in the name - those racist right-wing extremists, who shot 77 last year, men, women and children.
Instead, it only applies to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone is in their peace-loving country to such brutal killings.
It is held responsible for today's wealth in Norway since the early 1970's growth is one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is so good to us," said Anna, our waitress, which distributes round trays with seasoned rakfisk and with her long blond hair and blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal says.
We are a people - as they say - need to be careful.
Your English is exactly like that of most of the people here.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not emerge.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very careful - a large part of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As with all money raised in the years up to the global economic crisis, which they had not, Norway, held its purse firmly closed.
"As long as we can go in winter, skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, rakfisk eating," she adds with hearted laughter.
I am in the snow and instead of me for another court - from rakfisk I have enough.
Such a moose burgers is definitely something else. The juicy meat tastes wonderful to me.
But on the evening of the stink fish on the menu is once again.
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several venues that can organize a rakfisk dinner, guests at the vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to one, with fly dressed show master, which is surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What have ye up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Harvard."
They applauded and laughed.
A man is overwhelmed by his chair, possibly from the aquavit.
But perhaps it is, but the severity of the whole fish.
