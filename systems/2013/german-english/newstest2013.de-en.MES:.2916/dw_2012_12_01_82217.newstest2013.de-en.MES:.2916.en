Szabo: "German must play a greater role,"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the motion of the Palestinians' observer status at the United Nations.
But then contained Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza did not.
Now Germany must be careful, however, because of its special relationship with Israel.
At the same time, however, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it comes to set up a no-fly zone.
This was, after all, enforced by NATO.
Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is true.
This is due to the fact that it is precisely his foreign policy and away from a policy that has been gemanaged, so to speak, by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
Compounding that Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The German is therefore find themselves between the fronts.
One expects from them that they play a more independent role, but not because they are accustomed to.
I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What is a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It also shows the willingness to take positions on national interests, which are independent from those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, in other words, the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have had influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful, the general public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, not the head.
It plays a role in any case.
But I would not want to attach too much weight, this is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it is definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, it has abstained in important decisions, such as when the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was a dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will play a certain amount of respect.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests are taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.
By contrast, the United States have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Due to the American domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
However, due to the political situation here, the government can, of course, does not represent the position publicly.
I believe that the real differences are not so big, as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy.
Germany find it hard to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that this is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little bit easier for the Germans, if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead must push things from their own position.
Just make it with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future, to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as a major international players - Germany wants to play a major role at all?
The lead or Germany is still difficult?
Germany is not yet accustomed to the fact that the country is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, because every time when Germany takes on a greater role in a wide variety of anti-German feelings.
It is not just the Germans.
This is, in fact, the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be susceptible to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who remains otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like it, and there is still a lot more unpopular makes it - c'est la vie!
