In Colorado, there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime before the court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar, close to the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, had been summoned for the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien - excusable peccadilloes, which are equipped with a fine of $100 - and received a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco.
But he is also one?
To legalize marijuana in the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drug offences less by the law, rather than from the site.
Hundreds of Administrative Offences, which revolve around marijuana, and dropped in the state of Washington, has already approved similar measures.
The police authorities are no longer adults over 21 years for possession of small dimensions. This is legally permitted, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that pursuing existing marijuana offences and people are still quoting in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J., the police chief in Aurora, which lies to the east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington scratching perplexed at the head.
They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and we have a deadline on 1 December 2013 before our eyes.
In Washington there is of the opinion that Colorado is, in any case, most of the states with regard to the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes, and then to the own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, the state therefore well suited to the orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that there is no place or system can do more to serve as, in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent, which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, known as I-502 enters into force on 6 December in force and thus also forms the end point of a grey area, in which the state licensing system is not yet exist, but legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practice issues need to be resolved at this time - for example, as the government target of a "reasonable access" to which resulted in inserting beeps into marijuana should be agreed with the ban on the use of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare.
"Nowhere, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle," Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal, "a recently formed research group says.
On 21 November chief sent his employees in Aurora, an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21 years ago, and that the police "immediately" will strive for any prosecutions for these offences.
Chief added that the police will continue to enforce urban targets for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and would continue to pursue drug traffickers.
In Weld County in northern Colorados district prosecutor Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he gave his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for the possession of 50 grams of marijuana or less accountable in court, even though many have been indicted for other offences.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue violations, where they were at the time for crimes," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults for the possession of small quantities of no longer.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but it also decided to do so, not all outstanding procedures.
"I do not believe that I don't waste my time to implement the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged local officials a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.
District prosecutors if it is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendants in court for marijuana offences and local acts as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives to prosecute people for criminal that you can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states, such as alcohol, the smaller quantities of marijuana, Colorado and Washington acted as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sales, they also waiting nervously on the instructions of the federal government, which wants to treat the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level to continue as a crime.
Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give.
Despite several arrests of consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government allows the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Drogenpolitik adviser to the Obama administration is of the view that investigators are likely to enter any doors, to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but probably will be reluctant to condone the legal under the new legislation, state-regulated marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado don't wait for the fact that the federal authorities to act.
Before the election day some local municipalities approved moratorium on new marijuana shops, even though they could open up until about a year ago.
Last week decided Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then stand at the federal level, a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this legislative change.
Then we decided, for what the community and not afterwards, for which the state has decided.
There are still many questions open.
