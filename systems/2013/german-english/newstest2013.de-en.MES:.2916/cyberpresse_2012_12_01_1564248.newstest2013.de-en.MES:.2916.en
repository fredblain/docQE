A Republican strategy, to confront the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter for a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud is rare in the United States as the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of Republicans have recorded in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is for sure: these new rules will impact negatively on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the Member States.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws that hamper the process for the registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections of November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills have been introduced in 2011, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that the voters to present a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, also be shortened by these laws, the periods for the early vote, declared to be invalid, the right to register as voters on election day, and denied citizens the right to vote, for which a court acts.
Before the elections of 2006 has to show no US government demanded by the voters, a photo identification.
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice in other states.
In the course of the last two years, they encouraged to show bills in 34 states, with which the voters will be forced to a photo identification.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal ID card, such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e., 21 million eligible voters have no identification document issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a card in 2012.
There are, however, often to pay more than a hundred dollars, to obtain the necessary identification.
The new restrictions on young people, minorities and low-income people are affected disproportionately.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 years did not have the required photo identification.
This goes further.
The students, who are considered more voters, who will be voting for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo identification issued by its establishment.
On the other hand, it may choose the same states members of fishing or hunting clubs that more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state asked for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, which introduced such a request.
Since 2011 a dozen states have passed laws that demand from the voters that they prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures aim to limit the vote.
Because it is clear that two of the three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 in eight states, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the voter registration for the general elections in 2004, to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted in five other states laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections were in Florida 33% of voters who have chosen in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the whites, who constituted accounted for 76% of the electorate, only 46% of the voters who elected in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate-General of the United States has intervened in order to implement the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of electoral law.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws and see them as a clear objective is to influence the results in the key states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws, which make up, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with any certainty that these changes to the electoral system of legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will impact negatively on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine the democratic system of the United States.
