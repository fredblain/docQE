"The Internet as a medium for the search for information; however, with the release of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she says.

The digital natives, they are the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants, which is supposed to teach them, where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we demand of them that they have a defined criteria, which must be distributed, published or said, and that in an age where the maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be picky about who, if it is to think the most important thing to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is to provide you with questions, which brings you to reflect.
"To say to you, you should not do it, do not work," he says.
Porras then called a number of possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger, why do you find it on the Internet?
Or: would you, if you published a photo of you, such as that which thou hast published by a friend?
You know what the other post about you?
If you have other people asked for permission in advance, if thou hast labelled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: all need to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online, as they do offline.
