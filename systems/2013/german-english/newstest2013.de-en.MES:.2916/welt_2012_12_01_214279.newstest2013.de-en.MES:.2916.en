The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo seems to be the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as the basis is controversial.
The Egyptian president with pathos.
We need to create the transition.
"And that he succeeds, it is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was aimed at the whole nation, but, above all, to the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because they have all been hopelessly in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile from grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He did so, said Mohamed Morsi almost excuse the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed and its powers expanded, "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate of the American University of Southern California, save really wants the Egyptians, the world is not entirely in the clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
In fact, the 234 articles that were pushed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a late-night, 15-hour Parforceritt, partial worrying.
As in previous constitutions also stated in the draft, the law on the principles "Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
It was, and is, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will take advantage of the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
At least that sets a new article hinzugeführter close: in all matters relating to the Sharia al-Azhar University should be held to the rate, the most important Islamic institution in the country, with great power throughout the Sunni Islam.
This is not necessary, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would lead to the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much of the interpretation is Verfassunsgsentwurf
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule on the suppression of opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
The state should also protect, as it is in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and promote their morals and values. "
This is legally formulated so blurred that state institutions could control with the help of this article, even the content of film art and literature.
In plain English that means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, there is no article stipulates equality between men and women.
It bans or another to insult the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to slander.
But what is an insult and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Just as questionable is the wording, the "insulting people," was banned.
There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a jurist?
Morsi interpretation, like so much in the draft, which will be presented before the signature and according to his words, "very soon," the Egyptians to the referendum.
"The revolution is back,"
The opposition formed for weeks against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the charter to fall, even before they can enter into force.
"The revolution is back, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said, the draft Constitution "belong to the scrapheap of history."
He accused via short message service Twitter followers Morsi to want to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said the opposition persuade Yasser Said.
"We are still not tired, the blood of our brethren has yet to be paid," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced, do not want to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution,"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew on the counter-demonstration, but not in Tahrir Square, as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile river in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis attended and cried: "the people calling for the application of the law of God."
They demanded by Morsi: "don't use the country!" And promised: "the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, had summoned warlike conditions.
This obviously did not want to risk Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood said, both the opponents of the draft constitution, as well as the supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to be decided, the people at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word 'human rights does not happen again,"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this constitutional process, which would have until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they sat under Mubarak in prison or were in court.
For him, not because he would be part of their beliefs, but because human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now is the word 'human rights, not even in the new constitution," he complained in the interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
Morsi power to extend all three powers in the state had resigned the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of having to strengthen civil society, you have the president," de facto suspended Saeda complained.
But without civil society organisations could be a democracy does not work.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which sees the ideological direction of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
It could be revenge.
A protestor in Tahrir warns: "your gebährt a monster that you can no longer control."
