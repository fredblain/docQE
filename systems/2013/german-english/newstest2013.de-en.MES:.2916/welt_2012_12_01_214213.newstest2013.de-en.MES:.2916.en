There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country, in the 97-year-old are still relatively young.
Many people in the south of Azerbaijan to achieve a high level of age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country, in the 97-year-old are still relatively young.
The trip through the Talysch Mountains is to name wild romantic.
The minibus rumpelt on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one might think that being in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, which borders with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, not much is known, except that she speaks perfect Farsi and Aserisch and is very durable.
The terminal is Lerik.
The small town flaunts to powerfully meeting the architecture of Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here to tread the directions from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers, because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth, the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Lerik Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that the vehicle to the tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and in the next year, we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, the older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years ago, a children's shows
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, which is supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is not a birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, appears Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region, and he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years ago, he is said to have a daughter.
So has irali Müslümov charged at his age for a couple of decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also striking many hochaltrige people in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documentation no scientific proof to bring about the age, given that person was missing.
Every day, melted butter becherweise
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often striking a Biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why do so many elderly live here in the south?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of Talyschen.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is the food.
But that it is precisely the kalorienreiche Talyschen should be as healthy, especially the love meat, bread and milk products, many of which have daily drinking a glass of melted butter, from a nutritional point of view, not just seems plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years for this is still relatively young.
And 143 descendants Mirzayeva, which claims to have lived in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground back and forth rolls with butter, which you worked tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both of which are grandparents.
Two infants also jump around.
In the kitchen, preparing the tea, which is served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly under her headscarf conceals a long, dark blond braids, which reveals her son proudly in front of us.
I washed my hair with milk, so you never went out and retained their color.
"I have never used," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to life
She has always eat only what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the most serious in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar Aliyev Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult, which will drive the father figure of the nation, ruled his country like a dictator knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, and later his son, Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no emergency, Azerbaijan's old.
Mirzayeva, 230 Manat (about the same amount in euros) per month as a pension, a sum for local conditions, from which you can live well.
And perhaps has also long been Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: "the old enjoy in our culture."
They are living in the midst of the large family, are loved, and are happy.
If there is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
