My Mexican American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave due to the lack of opportunities, Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - call them hard times in the memory, he says
Navarrette is of the opinion that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, as the helplessness in me.
Signs point to two queues: one for "" ("Mexican"), another for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I grew up in central California, and my life has been referred to as "Mexican."
An ethnic shortcuts - exactly what my friends in Boston "Irish" or "my friends in New York," an Italian name.
Later, I decided for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to say to me in this language at both ends of the interviews.
But I do not have the vocabulary of Muttersprachlers, and my American accent I will also not meaningless.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for extranjeros.
I thought about those Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto moment this week, when the future visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues, which are expected to meet the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans today as most likely to remain in Mexico, rather than in the United States.
He would like to ally themselves with the United States and Canada, and create a North American trading bloc modelled in the European Union.
Mexico's Pena Nieto vowed to continue to wage the war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States in 1848, fell in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem gun forced to leave them more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, are memories of this event should not be overlooked.
As soon as a US government official criticism of Mexico, you can hear - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans are pressing the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children Montezumas go on the warpath.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about feelings of resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for which the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people Mexican origin living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, lies in the fact that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parents or grandparents emigrated part - got no chance in Mexico and in the north.
And, in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now living the American dream, have visited good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream, which we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes blurred, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial, a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties with Mexico never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families would not have failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would see us now is not behind the silk curtain caught - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and as a child legally in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who you are - and Mexican Americans.
While it is in American citizen, she sees itself as a part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, who I know, have the feeling to belong neither to the one nor to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You can enjoy the best of both worlds, but it is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
How should I learned during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie want to take their links to the diaspora.
Mexican Americans want to set up a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, such as a visit to this country and put pressure on the leaders to step up their ties to Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And, given the unequal income distribution, the rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I am afraid, because you need alone, amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some of the Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico, one and a half centuries, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.
