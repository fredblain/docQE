A constitution with the sledgehammer in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt remains divided on the constitutional declaration, which granted him temporary unlimited power, more than ever, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly on the next day will adopt its final version.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given to this House two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt is based on a number of occasions now for almost two years ago on a provisional, the amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has provided only for greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic" Delirium, "when he breaks his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the sides of his supporters we are assured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which the brothers forces to abandon their plan to explain the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president is once again to find it a manner, his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest rages across the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this resort to a hasty vote will be an ultimatum: "either is true for my draft or do I keep the unlimited power," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly to an end.
85 largely Islamist members of the constitutional assembly have adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
On the eve of the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have been turned away, because they are of the opinion that they are not in a position to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted alike.
In order to achieve the quorum were yesterday morning in haste 11 people, Deputy members, added.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously.
Moreover, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of the day is... In the time for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the clocks Â– the Constituent Assembly was not exactly.
The text, which has been adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which attracted all the attention is identical with that of the constitution of 1971, and states that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope that "the principles of" by "to replace the" rules, which would have made it possible to make a stricter application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article was not changed, proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals say that this can only be seen as a propaganda.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution via other articles.
In doing so, they have particularly Article 220 in the eye, which recognises the University of Al Azhar University a consultative role, particularly in terms of the examination of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia law.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier this is worrying, because the people who are not being asked for an opinion, "have been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals also fed by the fact that the next chancellor of the university is likely to be much less moderate than the present.
"There is currently no specific religious commitment to recognize.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no ulema, but academics, who have been trained partly in the French system, "says Alexis Blouet, who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition appeased.
He admits, "that can have an ambiguity in terms of the article, because the terms are used borrowed the religious vocabulary.
It is here, in particular refers to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of whether civil judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday will be severely criticized because of the far-reaching powers, which he was granted to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but a national defense council.
Likewise, there will be no ban on the use of civil proceedings in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their fears in relation to the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, in particular for the press.
Moreover, no longer article refers to the protection of women, underlines HEBA Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to say yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
