With Bitcoin without paying and selling bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system designed by banking monopolies, leading to financial crises.
This is indeed by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange, such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network about 200,000 transactions have already been collected.
A few thousand websites Bitcoin accept as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 has reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had five months later, he fell to $2, before he has recovered today at around 10 dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) shows in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest for this purpose.
She describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro," and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to make headway in a video game, which you can win games or buy (and sometimes back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
Each time, however, the trade is controlled by a central authority and processed.
With Bitcoin network nodes are all at the same time, trustees of the Court of Auditors, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Any transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of data associated with this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to make sure that the traded Bitcoins are taken into account in the book in the entire network of public accounts.
The decisive step is to contribute to this new transaction in this book.
This is happening on a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, which is a kind of preliminary central banker, has the privilege, add this additional line.
It is a carving up the file, i.e., the conversion of a large file in a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
"The computer," the new transaction and add a number before the whole thing is being hacked to bits. "
The goal is to find the one number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, and the other nodes can easily check, whether it is the right one.
The transaction is closely linked with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay to cheat twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes), with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network, and the other remains without a link, because both have different fingerprints.
The computer, which has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task will be increased with each improvement of computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stole the Bitcoin deposits.
"The vulnerability does not affect the actual Minutes," Pierre Noizat, which has just introduced Paymium, this is a company for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin assured.
The ECB also reported on the possibilities of money laundering by using this anonymous service.
However, cash has also these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
They will be accepted by others, such as the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyses of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the invoice book and shows that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-Schlussverkauf" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company, the Bitcoins Coinabul converted into gold looks forward.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book on this currency firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to the validation of the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages its identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented at the dealers, and the latter must install any new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to give an address that can be photographed by a telephone "and" recognized, Pierre Noizat indicates, which assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in the hierarchical systems to be reconsidered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time until 2013 Bitcoin prevails, but could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB sees in her report to assess the various today as a highly respected risks in the event of a success of this currency.
