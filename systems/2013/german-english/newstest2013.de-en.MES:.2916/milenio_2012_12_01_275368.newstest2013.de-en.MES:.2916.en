"South America needs to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 6th summit of the presidents of UNASUR, which took place in Peru in Lima said on state television that the Europeans' in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing "and" are now virtually a fatherland. "
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which push the Member States of the Unasur.
"Must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; but there are still reactionary sectors that strive for a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the agreement of San Jose on human rights.
Those who never commit to something, and in return, we sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights headquartered in Washington and will be financed by the United States," he said, alluding to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa asserted that he did not regret this decision, because it does not betray his principles, but also fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that it was "justified suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and not complied with procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which requires him to subject him an interrogation on its territory because of an alleged sex, while "the Swedish law, which allows via a video conference on the Embassy of Ecuador in London could be carried out."
Correa said that the danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since it is located in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador, however, has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the leader in Ecuador.
However, there is the danger that he treated physical and psychological damage, because he was trapped in a narrow space, and no physical exercises in the open air could carry out.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa was that the solution to the asylum, which was granted Assange since June in the Ecuador Embassy in London, the granting of a letter, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that it would be in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the legal authorities Europe's, he stressed that there have been talks with London, I have to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, this word, we do not apply in this case, however, there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a set of procedures at various European bodies," he said.
This morning, "when Britain granted carte blanche, this is done, in my opinion."
And if Sweden verhörte Mr Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or via Skype, as it was to be the Swedish law and made in other cases, the problem was resolved.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the malicious intent and the lie that weaken the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the most evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who aspire to profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated themselves that Ecuador is not more of these journalists, "and also not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and skewers bourgeois" countries, and it is anticipated that he will deepen in a re-election, "the revolution, and pursue the path in the right direction."
Correa also supported maintaining the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism must remain "hard and instead give any opportunism and no legal coup d'etat," because the legitimacy of democracy has been "destroyed in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the privileged maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua's maritime borders between the two countries to negotiate, for "absolutely justified."
This judgment is not implemented at the moment.
It is a problem between a South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be dealt with comprehensively, so that we can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America, to call international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
In terms of the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third mandate in order, he stated that he sees this possibility, "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he would lose the election in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances, such as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had to believe that I was guaranteed that likely victory, which is why I must comply with this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as President, then I would like to withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is crucial," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken with the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, he told me that he had traveled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba once again after the election campaign.
"In any case, it means a relapse into the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader took part in Lima today on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, which ended with a call for greater regional integration, to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security.
