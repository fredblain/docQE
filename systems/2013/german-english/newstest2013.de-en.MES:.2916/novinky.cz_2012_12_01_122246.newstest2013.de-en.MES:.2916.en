Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls annually a survey about the oddest bank charges, decided this year to hold the competition "absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"This idea of recently brought to us by the EU's plan to introduce a women's quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of this survey, compared to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women is located.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they represent a lower risk for the insurance companies.
"Further incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "Nacher said.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory admixture of ethanol fuel, which is in its follow-up naturschädigend, furthermore, banning mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or even the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen, because the eggs in this year have been much more expensive.
In the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in general are represented by one or more member countries (as the Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to push through, with veto threat, the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas of the highest class of trade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not an "anomaly" exhibit.
The European Commission defended with the argument that they only harmonisiere the fragmented national standards that would impede trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have already been watered down by the EU against the opposition of some countries, with the suggestion that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation of last year, according to balloons in the sale must be provided with the note that children under eight years are not allowed to blow the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU invoked an American study, which, in accordance with balloons are the leading cause of the suffocation of children.
A similar restriction already applies for children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious, cross-border raids at home
It is also relatively absurd - a directive that concerns the European officials themselves, everyone in the EU, which occupies an official function must not be used because of the sensitivity of the matter for Greece, the name of Macedonia and instead must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the association liberal economists laissez-faire, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the amount of food stocks on the territory of a member country.
The EU set the Hoechstvolumen food stocks, which was located on the day of our EU accession on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic, for example, then crossed the volume set for fungal canned foods, and a large fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money to ensure that they have no sea, or by the idea, however, to provide funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, however, came not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage that we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU, "said in autumn 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument, he said that the grain harvest was very high and overcrowded government camps as a result of the so-called intervention purchases goods.
The Czech Republic as another way to ports, according to the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
Finally, the European Commission was the Czech Republic so far that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered the communities, the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically, it should act to promote funding for the limits of money applications to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations in the Member States are easy to the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus deserves to efficiency and development of the entire European Union according to some experts, however, more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, which were, however, imposed in the budget negotiations by individual member countries.
Emotions cause is the fact that the Czech Republic similar to other member countries in Brussels to fight for the right to use of specific names of traditional products and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic was able to defend after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvaružky, the residents (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but in our manufacturers have had to rename" Tuzemák. "
The name may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the Karlovy Vary rusks, carp from Pohorelice and Trebon, or even the more hops appear in the company of the world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham.
With an EU trademark Pardubicer gingerbread or the Horicer breasts roles.
