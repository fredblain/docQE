After the Appeal Court of the United States has confirmed a ruling, which does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the group, which has been achieved over a bankrupt trade in Mexico, a pernicious precedent for each national companies with offices in the neighbouring country will be created, the payment problems.
One could say that the procedures for the survival of the company, which allow the Mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment on 15 June handed down by the judge at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale leads for the northern district in Texas that Mexican companies are exposed to the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river Bravo helpless.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, in order to call for tripartite inconsistencies the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judges of the matter indicates that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the Appeal Court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans first says that it is the main proceedings in Mexico to the trade deals with bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in the procedures in the case of default of companies is not known with länderübergreifendem profile.
Indeed, for this purpose, the model law was created by the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, but the American Law Institute has been used as a mediator.
Secondly, the ruling states that it is not the majority required for the restructuring of the debt would be without the votes of the companies after the recognition of the liabilities in the liquidation, which had branches of vitro with its parent company, has been achieved.

It is also true that after deducting the votes of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained in the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had no majority.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37 percent.
This will not be taken into consideration by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, there are blamed for his difficult situation from 2008 in the framework of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country.
This is why the Gonzalez Sada family before the same court sets a contradiction, so that the vote will take place in plenary, i.e., of all the judges, because only three of them were voting.
It will not be granted, will be the Cerciorare appeal, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious in this case is that the court had set aside a document, which was sent by an amicus curiae (friend of the court of the government of Mexico under the figura), what is the procedure will be explained in the framework of the law on trade bankruptcies, and pointed out that it will adhere strictly to the agreements signed by the two countries had to meet the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law in the United States.
In addition, it is pointed out that the country subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
