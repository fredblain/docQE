Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford, because I am Tory
Today, not only university students to be attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once held for the world's largest stamp, for a modern Greek symposium, which encouraged the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after I entered the Worscester College in the late 1980s - there I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said, I would have gone, because I would have had a problem with the fact that students in neighbouring rooms had sex.
The author A N Wilson said Haydn, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
One had harassed me only for one reason - a reason, which seemed in this so-called cradle of enlightenment so parochial and cruel: my late father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatchers and I advocate in the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to the latest reports is suffering from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred on the Tory students in Oxford has gained such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection, who is gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College, they are often due to their political views, "active in isolation, attacked personally and declared undesirable."
They are calling for ensuring a place in the Equality Committee of the college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as Exzentriker and neo-Nazis represented.
It shows an alumnus Joe Cooke, a former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls Royce was, among other things, and with silver suit and silver occupied floor protzte.
Conservative students at other universities say they are regarded as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham said in a Sunday newspaper: "there is a growing trend at universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon club without having to have met us at all. "
In Corpus Christi, Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent, who initiated the request for greater protection is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student association of Oxford says that they have observed in JCR members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
When I was incredibly shy 18-year-old arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - as a result of cuts in higher education, not an honorary title.
The atmosphere would be even Stalinisten on terror.
In the first days of the current week, the new students learn more about themselves and the tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even with the joys attended it.
Political issues, such as the miners' strike, the privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
In my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century English. On what should happen, I was not been taken.
", Miss Wyatt said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased)," please translate the first paragraph. "
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and quite invidious.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or they are simply stupid?," he asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Tears in my eyes on wallten.
"I suggest that you do in your free time, a couple of hours - in other words, if they are not too concerned with their social activities are," Pitt gave vent to me.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
On this evening, I sat in the college alone at dinner, when someone typed me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father close to Margaret Thatcher, therefore, it will be worse for you.
Most of the Tory pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to adjust to me.
I insisted that I do not agree with Mrs. Thatcher was in all respects.
This should prove to be unsuccessful.
A study in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, as a conservative force Eton College had visited, said to me: "you are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"As Tories have sex?" One asked me.
Each other?
I felt so, such as homosexuals in front of the more liberal legislation in the United States had to have felt like.
I think it would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
I would be able to meet like-minded after collapse of darkness?
I should have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that were in front of me, extended before my mind to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, which was open to identify themselves as Tory, Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he had discussed Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and to write speeches for you.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic-fascist history perspective.
In 1997, he took a professorship at the BMP Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he said to me.
I started to commuting between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties were accepted all the political views.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
You would never do such a thing, not in my city of the tower.
Even my friends always impeccable manners on the day.
His wet eyes marred.
Give me a chance.
I am sure that you can only neckt.
It would break my heart if you.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and Renounce his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, when another Geschichtstutor claims seriously, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I zerging secretly in shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone a "brainwashing," and called them "old sucker."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who suggested the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and my Häscher gave up after five minutes.
As they went, I grabbed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weinerlichen tail.
But no 18-year-olds should ever have to suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice.
And even worse is that it was a University of Oxford, which spawned not only 14 Tory Prime Minister, but is far behind a reputation of equality and freedom of thought hidden.
