Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (the Czech Republic, which was on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA and participated in the following years on several projects.
The path of Poland in the space, however, began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish workers with the space, but they do not always understand.
I would remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "entrance to the Kosmonautik."
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience, however, cold, and after years of remembered Šternfeld that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the Kosmonautik" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André-Léonard Louis deer donated Prix rep Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been acknowledged by the fact that one of the crater was named after him on the side of the moon erdabgewandten.
Already in 1925 a railway trolley was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is still not clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to slow down the trolley.
The details come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research, the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia resulted in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents that the research was reached in the stage of practical tests.
But the research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 of ING appeared in the press on Rohozinski draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and in the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects have been coordinated with the military use of missile technology from passing by scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, however, his work was finished by the start of the war.
Other articles on the space appear after World War II, thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is carried out in 1954 in the November issue of the journal, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to the space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space society.
At the time there were already the first projects to the satellite technology, and it was to see that the exploration of space would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA sought accession to the 1951-based International Federation for space, and indeed the PTA was already in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), vice-chairman of the International Federation for space.
This office he held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1 was completed in 1957, the first start was on 10 October 1958.
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959, and flight tests began in the Bledowska Desert with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 kilometers and come to use for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, the further development has been stopped.
His successor in the first missiles of the type developed the Meteor missile was in the years of 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as Zweistufenrakete, their total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1a, -1b and -1c), which differed from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor missile had a room with 0.4 liters capacity, Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and Meteor-0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude fraud in all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor missile was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km.
Later versions of the meteor-2H and Meteor-3 have been built.
Also worth noting the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, is on the two years later was followed by the establishment of a national committee COSPAR.
Poland also participated in the framework of the programme Interkosmos on space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was second after the Czechs Vladimir Remek Interkosmonaut.
