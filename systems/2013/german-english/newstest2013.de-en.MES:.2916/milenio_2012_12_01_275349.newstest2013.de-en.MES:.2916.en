Sources in the Heads of State and President firm initially told that they would be handed over to it after the examination, said, however, that it would be published for some time on the website of the Peruvian government.
If you have any questions about the text, you said that the content of the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was set out in brief statements to the press.
