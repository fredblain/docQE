Analyzed the Higgs-only
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs-bosons has caused a stir in the last summer, and for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this only is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And, finally, is the last particle whose existence was our best of the standard model - or "at least" false declaration of nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is still not completely sure that it is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the standard model Higgs-only.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data, which were presented this week at a major conference in Kyoto, but there is a lack of data, to be completely safe.
Nevertheless, we are assuming that it is actually the Higgs, there seem to be only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we look at what it is all about.
In this world there is a law, which means that two objects may not be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and they do not try to do too much, because you are hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law is also for you: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are located in the same "Quantenzustand," with this "condition" is from some of their properties.
Based on the part of the particles in two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are referred to as Fermione and obey the principle.
And in another move the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that you can, in fact, are located in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the website The Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is) absolutely amazing into two groups: the decay, which we will not deal with here, and the "power" through which the large forces of nature and spread with the Higgs-only would somehow related.
But here it must be stressed that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, as one might think.
If you are in the position to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a bosons of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light," which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle speeds up with an electric charge or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field exactly at this place, "disturbed" about like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon, and thus one of the bosons "sources of power."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs-only, with the difference that another field that Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this only shows up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to reach very high energy, a bit like a frozen pond, whose surface could be zerfurcht only by a very large rocks.
This is why we need a giant particle accelerator at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 km! - to achieve this kind of energy.
Once again, the analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do not do this, but others - for example, a sheet of paper would never even in the refrigerator.
And not all of the particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon) have no mass.
For all this research can now be "good," said Mrs Plamondon asks?
For the science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to investigate all the differences between the observations and predictions of SM.
Moreover, there are many physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some of the holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter has more major shortcomings, because it offers no explanation for the gravity (UPS!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter in the universe (again!).
However, at CERN such deviations were not found until now.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population are more difficult to say, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw further scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Boyle - which has worked in the Bell, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the self-developed in 1962 the first laser (the first were gepulst) - has already said that the laser was seen at the beginning, rather than a "laboratory."
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, in turn, has developed Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in a small room.
Although it was not the original purpose, serves this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know it...
