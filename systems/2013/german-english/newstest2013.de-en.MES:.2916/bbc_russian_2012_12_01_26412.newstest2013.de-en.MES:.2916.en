In the last few days it was everywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will continue, or whether you soon the air goes out.
The protests are supported by unions and several left-wing organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple Walmart and almost food- employees, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far this sector of the economy is hardly organized trade unions.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, which were held in the United States, the Ausverk√§ufe attracted millions of customers, which has led to sometimes to Handgemengen.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, your work and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target audience are low and middle-income people.
Cannibalizing sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries up to dust extractors, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores in the interface between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only on their own work.
Prices and product lines were cannibalizing to one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics often cannibalizing the goods can only sell so cheap, because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about working conditions, for example, lack of forklift or scanner.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday," asked for wage increases, and expressed their irritation that the contribution to the operating their own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employees, which earned 9.5 dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company increases the average wage at 12 dollars an hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars it would cost.
The donations are about 1.1% more than they now pay.
To make the wage increases would be cannibalizing fully to the customers, they cost more in the future only 46 cents.
That would be a year for you today, compared to more spending of only 12,39 dollars.
Advocates of cannibalizing satisfied to note that it was only in nine states to protests and that gave the company any losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and in this period cannibalizing sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart funds led to the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees work and the protest only "another PR stunt," the union, which organized the protests, was.
"Free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their objective, however, were not Walmart stores (which are not wanted in this progressive city, and that is why so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work.

At present, the minimum wage legislation in accordance with federal and New York is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants will raise the minimum wage, but not too strong, and the average in their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No less than they deserved in this expensive city.
How is it possible, to come to New York with so little money, incomprehensible.
There was once upon a time, in which nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.
No one saw the main source of income or planned to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's people who complain that they have to come up with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper, the author points out, it would be irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's in the Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashier and chefs from fast-food restaurants will receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate governance, to stand in the way this objective and to urge union members or to fire.
On the other hand, the company makes it will not be easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
On this day Lautstarke protests, there were also many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a meeting at midday before the McDonald's at the Times Square, in which some local Democrats languages, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it should sell billion portions, and yet it gives you no sick days, and ye shall not paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food staff together, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, which everyone deserves New York!."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, not all of which are far from being employed in the fast-food industry, in which tens of thousands of work in New York.
It is not yet to see whether the spark of these protests will mobilize the masses.
