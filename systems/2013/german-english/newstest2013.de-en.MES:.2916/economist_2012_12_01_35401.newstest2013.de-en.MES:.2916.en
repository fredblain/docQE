Old battles, the new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
It can ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to be such a hope to nip in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blame were countless buildings to rubble and ash, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis - and, for the first time, rockets are taken from Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although both Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether you want it or not - both Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally find their end.
A war, which will neither lost nor gained
At first glance, seems to be optimistic in the face of the current situation anything other than appropriate.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November persists, the this week's struggles have strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
Since 2007, the leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group saw large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and packed the 1.7 million residents of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and dense bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel until now failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that you have the time on their side.
So, as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has to take powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, Israel's closest Muslim ally, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once known as has taken for Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren could face the Stürzung Bashar's, up to Jordan, where hamas- allies are threatening the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - the strongest and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is verschwägert with Hamas and its leaders more dependent on People's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be a player, which can not be wooed by Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, however, leave the opposite conclusion.
Hamas is no longer a military threat.
The Israeli anti-missile system, "Iron Dome" has been able to prove its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
Israel will be able to sleep, at least for a while.
In diplomatic terms, the United States hold firm on its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed 30 Israelis since 2004, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers remain, not least thanks to the closed plants, which lost in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state to protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared contrary to international law, however, continue to be developed.
Netanyahu is well in the run-up to the election on 22 January his Likud party has allied itself with Avigdor Lieberman with a still kämpferischeren group.
This is why cuddled scheming Palestinians and leave them a state of their own?
In fact, if you have control over the West Bank, then they would not like their comrades-in-arms in the Gaza Strip to fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them in check and punish those behind the wall, you should dare to raise the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to carry, but the Arab Spring could make you a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries on the seat of power, have little left for Israel, you will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is greater than that of his four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will help the new Arab governments in the repair of its economy.
Indeed, that is the pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama together to achieve a cease-fire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Even Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world, taking tentative steps in the direction of democratisation, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt someday explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like this week, a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to the suppression of Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly demand over the years, its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The right answer is, those who will be represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and from this newspaper: two states, where Israel for security purposes.
The small - for the near future, the hope is that the cease-fire outsiders grants more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must stop now, together with Turkey and Qatar, the arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by trade and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would be done more than for the creation of a Palestinian state with the forthcoming request for a UN observer status.
Obama, too, must play its part to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he missed the presentation of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if it were a reluctant participation.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
