Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there are Mercury ice on the planet.
The ice may be up to 20 metres thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, as is evident from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science."
The Messenger probe have found evidence that there is an ice in the region permanently in the shadow of the planet.
They should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids that are taken on the Mercury.
But nobody put the discovery of ice in connection with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon said.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, to explore the depths of space.

The name is derived from the Latin word trifidus Trifid (divided into three sections, dreigespalten), because dark dust strip dreiteilen the fervent heart of the birthplace of stars.

Our insight into all: the most important telescopes
The telescope should have been invented by Hans Lipperhey - before Galileo Galilei set up a year later to the star observation.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes were growing - and the insights that they deliver, deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular Telescope.
It looks to be in the same all over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone, the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Construction: the telescope is ground to a halt in his elevation - and thus limited in his mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high light gathering force.
This is enough - despite the comparatively low mirror diameter - the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to the alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
"In the" search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) each computer owners can help by putting more computing power available.
Overlooking the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, which makes his name.
With a total of four reflect the telescope will be able to shine in the medium-sized Infrarotspektrum.
Also on the Chilean observatory was NASA's Hubble Space Telescope is being planned.
Its main mirror should include whopping 42 meters - and will be set from nearly 1,000 mirror elements together.
But with the images until at least 2018 is to be expected.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea, as the largest in the world.
They offer two levels with an average of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which, along with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on the Mauna Kea is intended to create a new, huge telescope, with an average of 30 meters.
It is here to gaze on an illustration.
However, the main impressions from all the space telescope Hubble supplies.
Since 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the search for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 was announced by NASA that 1,235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission began.
In the picture, the last launch preparations are documented on the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot at the earliest 2018 aboard a Ariane5 rocket into space.
The primary mirror of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: there are looking for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice on the south pole of the Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data, as the Messenger circles far closer to the North Pole to the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
The Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first, which revolves around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
