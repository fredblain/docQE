Singapore babies needed to rescue the economy
The Stamford put the blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the children.
"The people of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, thou art my patriotic duty wife: we meet our citizens, and we are creating life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising Minzbonbons, but - or precisely for that reason - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as "will be a" Bao "(loaf) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who has shot the video preserves the hope that the commercial funny manner, to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to perform their "national duty."
This is something only for the Internet, which is why we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The Fortpflanzen we are the worst in the world, and that is why we realized that this is an issue that we had to look into the matter.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume flirting with Pheromonen or the organization of speed dating evenings (quickly).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but not necessarily led to success.
Therefore, we thought: why don't we do something as creative as possible to deal with this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?
1.2 children
If this issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore.
Every year, there are 1,300 dollars for political measures to encourage people to have more children.
A package of government for couples and parents up to 15,000 dollars per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax advantages.
But everything so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-technology city-state in south-east Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the Stamford more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of the national population authority says that this was partly due to a "better training" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has enabled the people, except to marry and form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in the social realities have contributed to the higher number of alone, and the delay marriage and birth rate, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims to tackle on a surge in immigration in order to reduce the population to resentment in the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the little laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are critical to ensure that they do not keep wages low and integrate.
The increase in the number of immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the government party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the well-known effects on the economy of a nation that tax revenues, the health-care costs and the immigration policy, the example of Singapore has also shown unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that many small apartments are not built.
She also has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and must be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, the concern is that they can support the lifestyle of the alone, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large apartment for families.
However, Lim yew soon, Director-General of the real estate company says that his "shoe boxes" to sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that you are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards wanted to give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way, if you build too many small units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, is to take the talks with the Singapurern, the work in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"People are highly stressed that housing and education are expensive, which is why it is delayed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me, it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old man.
Men and women have their careers, the stress and the costs for the property and the education as reasons that you can have no children.
That is why the Stamford have the last word when it comes to have children, because the government can do so much.
