Share of legal weapons offences extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the arms law for private gun owners.
Thus, the authorities to respond to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the rampage of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police do not want to ban the deadly weapons in the public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been the chairman of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes will be presented to the arms of the Duma shortly.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems through "attraction of the screws."
An open letter was published in the Internet, whose authors call - representatives of various associations - from the authorities to take the "senseless" distance.
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the experts in criminal law, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC said.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes committed with the use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousands of crimes have been recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will hold criminals not to use on the black market.
At the moment, you can find in Moscow, according to the authors any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.

According to make a contribution to the black market arms manufacturers Baranez.
