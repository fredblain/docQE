Instead of their own culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "avant-garde," which is dedicated to city residents who form the avant-garde art and culture.
On the list have already landed high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city, and who often find recognition in Europe, without having to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt of extravagant artists Miller.
The whole town knows Miller, the bearded, dressed in red and one time at the Russian Museum, in the summer garden scene meetings or at openings.
Wherever the images of Miller, they attract large crowds.
Miller is one of the typical of St. Petersburg social philosophical artists, the new myths.
Miller is a luminous personality of the avant-garde end of the 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures up by his presence on the street for his fellow citizens a smile in the face and makes you a good mood.
He recently grabbed a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg summertime, as it is for this difficult role in terms of his life, his philosophy and his image finally felt ready.
Why, for example, you're not actually always in red and yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world is red, the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
Everything in the society, which deviates from the norm, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get through my provocations with the people in the conversation.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- when you know that you need to be?
- at an exhibition in the Cultural Palace, in which my works were exhibited.
I realized that I have to go down this path.
Then there is the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter came to an end at the time, and new and free painters like I was incomprehensible.
I am friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; "Rachmaninow" and then once was concluded.
It attracts me to the theater, to the fashion, to the music, in fact, apart from the literature.
- and all the united in your kind of clinic... - it was important for me to be at the heart of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best new artist should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there until the renovation a musically artistic club for the Boheme, the house of Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: name., Tequilajazzz, and I remember, as with his project "Ucho van Goga" came there.
Cord and his friends sang songs to the play-back, wore T-shirts, and also to you today's hottest composer Igor Wdowin belonged.
When the group began to play live, was removed from the "Leningrad."
The costume moderated many programs before the time of "Halli Galli."
We gave them the costume, and it began his career, but he learned the basics with us.
Even the gallery "d 137," or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the clinic.
Our employees and regulars were there.
I am a hero of the last century, as culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press, which was about the award "personalities of our city."
I won in the category of "Artist of the Year," and so I had reached the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, to make a cultural contribution.
- your works have an unmistakable style.
- many of my pictures are genuine pearls and bring the timeliness and sharpness of the ideas expressed.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
In the past, I was afraid of social, but now it hurts and is preparing to be the case.
In a clown that blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have ideas.
For example, we save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone respects the clothes and is based on the outside, not the inside of the people.
But perhaps we should not be a people's hands, but should he spit in the face.
The deception will disappear by dressing up.
Recently, we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- commercial art can also be beautiful?
Today, commercial art must be careful and considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
In the past, people were the other major groups: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to fall.
I am not one hundred dollar note, which falls each.
Now you have to think you, whom thou shalt case.
Now, each about 100 supporters.
- to the performances of Stas Michailow, however, several thousand!
- abandoned women come to him, where the social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less money, and all perish.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is that you do not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I have painted these pictures, which were hung in a collector, even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images, which are usually only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty in order to rejected time and money.
This is the culture that I support.
Petersburg - what is missing?
- good cultural experts.
One says: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Tzars, it was different, because the Tzars may not understand a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have experts who could be, but you will be the road, because it requires hochrangigerer experts who assess the former right and make them the way.
Now only one's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, however, with the difference that you have to say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some other museums.
Petersburg - which is for you?
Petersburg - is not the cultural capital; in Moscow, there is far more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones art can grow up is difficult.
For example, we need a cultural ferment, because we now have more writers as readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art must again be modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants in the town of St. Petersburg
