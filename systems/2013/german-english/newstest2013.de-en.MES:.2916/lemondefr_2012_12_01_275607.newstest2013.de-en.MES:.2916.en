Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Administration, companies in the construction sector, creators of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia every day to tell what they know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are enmeshed.
A "industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange, as the system is unraveling, since it has taken drastic measures," Jacques Duchesneau, an MEP in Quebec and a former head of the Montreal police witzelt.
The scandal was revealed by him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the Treaties in Quebec, which had reluctantly agreed with the then Prime Minister.
The report "Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "would have been the Transport Ministry alone saved $1 billion on the Treaties," because some zügelten your instinct to get their share.
The Commission, "Charbonneau already has two mayors brought to fall," he adds, "in the hope that it will be able to show the tactics behind the individuals."
Launched in 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit
Launched in 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit taking with their troops to auditors, the government and analysts also identify a great deal of effort.
In addition, the police force, "the" marteau, which has since 2009, that the "cartel" Montreal is more circumspect in the artificial inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, it has made house searches and raised accusations of fraud and corruption against local representatives such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec, the third-largest city.
He is suspected of having received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Moreover, engineers have been accused of Straßenbauamts of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino zambito.
The latter has attracted attention by the Commission explains the functioning of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He himself has paid for several years, 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator, associated with the Mafia gave the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr zambito has had in the 2000s throughout his hand in the game, he gave more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) province of political parties, especially on the power of his liberal.
He also admitted to have organized an illegal fundraising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles surprising has described it in detail before the Commission: ten years ago, he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736.000 in return for contracts, whose costs artificially pumping up.
Other officials of the Road Administration have admitted that they were artificially aufblähten the bills with false benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party's mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay accused that he deliberately overlooked on a shadow budget, which has filled its coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations at the beginning of November, Mr Tremblay resigned, which Montreal plunged into a serious crisis.
Chantal rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, which suggested an alarm.
As a citizen mistress of the budget of the city district of Rivière-des-prairies, in the east of the island, they rejected 2010 against the sale of a community that, for $5 million was bought and sold for 1.6 million developers in the booming real estate market.
More than 70% black money in the election campaigns
The investigation, which is being carried out at the end of the day, she says that they "on a thread, which allows you to understand the workings of the system of ants migrated to stop the evil and to condemn the culprits."
She says that the procedure "was painful, but in a positive way."
We are trying to clean up the wound, but need only one for Montreal certain investigative unit, as well as a supervision, in order to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean power.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but above all thoughts about the role of the "mandate, which are about the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a share of more than 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he witzelt: "I was told that this is only a weak imitation of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to political parties to $100, which would change nothing in the situation, according to him: "as long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of political parties: "we cannot fall deeper; when we go to the bottom of things with courage, we can build the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh, to take a look in their own backyard...
