Nkú chief: control of the Black system failed due to the fault of the policy
The Czech Republic has in connection with public contracts on good control bodies and adequate laws, however, falls back in their application.
In the interview for Aktuálne.cz of Vice-President of the highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úrad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala says so.
"A law is never completely, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case with us," said Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar outcome is apparently also a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
Prime Minister Petr Necas as a negative example he leads the attitude to the so-called "black system."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not burden the entrepreneurs with controls - so the system now is banned or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, however, and if something is prohibited by law, but it is not just the chairman of the government, and hinder the control office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other.
What was it?
It is a parallel review, with which we have started about two years ago.
Easier said, it is important that the European legislative determines how to handle public contracts to build the national legislation and, finally, there is the real practical application.
This is all we have compared with each other, and even though the review is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are with us, maybe even a little "strict and perfect," the actual application, however, is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish, always new and more detailed rules. You must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How you can be an aid project? What emerges from this project?
It is precisely such a joint control could help that we stop to constantly strive for a perfect balance of the laws and the lowering of thresholds, if this is apparently not particularly positive impact.
Efficiency means one thing to purchase at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and rule out unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
It is perhaps even in such a way that we are only the excessive burden on the system in this way, "paperwork," and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to use the system, as if the threshold were higher.
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
What is the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the Federal Audit NKÚ, which is similar to us, and also has a college, which will be formed only a little differently, but fundamentally similar work both authorities.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is, however, a federal state, which means that there are courts of auditors in the individual Länder - is the German system differs from our.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the counties and municipalities are subject to the control of the land audit offices there.
As regards the German legislation, it is easier than our?
In general, I would compare this reluctant without any concrete information. However, in a sense, is often described Germany as a model, but you can certainly not say, however, that Germany is better.
Perhaps it is that the auditors are better there?
This is not determined, but as I said: I don't particularly like comparisons.
This is to say that even those countries that are a model for us, will also have to contend with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing of a cooperation with our authority, isn't it?
As regards the Czech legislation, which had meaning for their authority, the revision of the public procurement law, you already feel any impact?
Given that this is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests.
Since our controls take place later, you have to expect here with a certain amount of delay.
We feel so far more impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and examined and analyzed with this nearly 14,000 public contracts - here are the changes impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified
You can see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption has been confirmed.
It can occur, however, the problem is that the rules are "severe," and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules are an audit of the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, accountable to the Regional Council) to the effect that any breach of the public procurement law amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But then it is useful to make the law even stricter?
I do not think that in this way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a mistake, which does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system is only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.
Where is the way out here?
Firstly, we say, which is not targeted way.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
The black system is banned or permitted?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the government can not come easy chair, and hinder the control office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work.
He can say: 'we change the law and allow the matter, "but he could not say that we are doing so, as if nothing would.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer will be excluded solely because of errors.
The law will never be completely, but it must be applied correctly - and I think that is what is missing from us.
