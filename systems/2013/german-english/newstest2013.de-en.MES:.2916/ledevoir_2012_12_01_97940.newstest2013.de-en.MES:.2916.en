Palliative care - the best way to die... | le devoir
With your Committee "die in dignity," Quebec recently discussed the thorny issue of life.
The debate must be included in the near future, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much to be done in this important area.
Le devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which had aufzehrte him, let him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have managed seven years," he said, half-heartedly, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he was reached the day before.
"However, there is always a shock, you can't be prepared," he says.
The disease makes their work: an immense weakness prevents him to go to the toilet, and even to eat alone.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned to help with dinner.
Even succeed him to smile and to talk with the stranger, which employs around him, around him bring his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, since this is humiliating," he shares with.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man in the stand," Pierre-Victor-Gadbois told Brodeur, a psychologist in the home.
In the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation returning home for some people.
"That depends on the ability of the person," to take a step backwards, he notes.
According to several people who work in the palliative care to find great events taking place in the midst of this regression.
All the patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, you will be inundated by the doctors and nurses, who care about you, not with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is aware of, "and" by suffocated to death.
But I learned my children really know by the disease.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more hope in life," she says, before she accepts that one up a mask, which helps her breathe.
You can expect in the next few days still have a last visit their son, who comes from Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois offers with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the food intake.
The palliative care will then be used, if there are no other options.
To make it more enjoyable.
In Quebec a bed for the palliative care comes to 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little, if you take into account that we all die someday.
Here life will continue under the best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Given the dying according to a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control their blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we have a beer served Mr X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son will be drinking beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," director Nathalie Savard reported.
The home Victor-Gadbois is not like the other day.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, which enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and well supported by his pillow, while one is in his honor, dies, a young man of 36 years ago, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.
"Six months since three to five beds are occupied with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years ago," said Dr. Christiane Martel shares with concerned.
53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their dwelling, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is to say to a care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients, if the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major shortcoming in the healthcare Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concern.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health-care system Quebec is not powerful enough to ensure that all have the right to a quality palliative care, before it is accepted, move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, no one has taken measures to alleviate.
I am afraid that the patients want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And, at the same time, several ONCOLOGIST treat their patients despite the worst predictions doggedly until the last day.
The survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as she has canceled an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my Onkologin that I will break off the treatment, she replied that they regret that I am giving up the fight, they said.
However, she had told me that I was at the end of the day.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish to thank, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be said clearly that the palliative care is not in pain treatment Janet Quarton.
After Monereau, director of the palliative care of society of domestic palliative care of Montreal are talking about 8% of patients to a pain treatment.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to the-terminal sedation, which amounts to the patients either einzuschläfern sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer do so, as if we do not take this side of suffering.
Patients without pain will increasingly be able to fall back on these-terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is relieved not to say all the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want that they put me," but "I would like to say that my pain is relieved."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship Canadian health research institutes.
