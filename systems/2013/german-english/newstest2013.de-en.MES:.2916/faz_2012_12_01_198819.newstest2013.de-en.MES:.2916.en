"" trademark protection in China: if Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind an officially registered designation in China, which has nothing to do with the company, however, hides.
However, as long as they do not accuse protection, such as the actual name.
And even then, it is not clear whether they get right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Patt hole, lawyer in the firm Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protective rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The other countries have indicated a few additional letters enough so that they are not allowed to register their brands.
Lu Gucci, Prada will simply enter from Gucci, Prada-Kny.
German companies will also be legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Stand-off hole opens up a folder with entries of the PCT in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company, the trademarks protect Zegna DF Puma, a name, which is also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are the world champions in copying and the injured intellectual property rights, is well known.
In the large cities there are stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
But Pattlochs cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he is opposed to the fact that Chinese companies from the Trademark Office officially receive the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This means that women are rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"This is, we must fight it," calls for stand-off hole.
"The brand will be diluted, which disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion in the year of the third-largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing.
But DELETION dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the process can drag, with an uncertain end.
Reports of cases in which the court rejected complaints, because the name was rejected after the long duration of the "market has become a reality."
If the plaintiff misfortune, he must pay the Plagiator even money, because he violated its brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company that recently took over the German concrete pump.
The Chinese must therefore today use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes.
The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue and white logo, which reminded BMW; the dispute has been resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which would look at the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The trademark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
In the past year, but it was returned by the "emergency in the workflow to normality."
So the stock unbearbeiteter appeals procedure was decreased by 22 percent.
You almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, are still waiting in the office 81.500 appeals to carry out.
It costs a lot to deal
As so often happens in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year, more than 1.4 million applications were CTMO on trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
It was a record and means that China for the 10th time in a row, the list of new registrations in all over the world, who shares with authority.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 1.8 billion yuan had been taken on charges.
This means that any simplified registration costs, on average, 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It costs a lot to go against it, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years ago, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
It is true that the Germans have been able to achieve its illegal manufacturing imitierter motor vehicle parts was dug.
But the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg.
We have failed to do that, because in Germany family names could not be protected, hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical says in Munich.
Indeed, the trademark office CTMO rejected the appeal of the Munich.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got it right, but the process opponents continue fighting until today.
We must be careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "this process is extremely time-consuming and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly figure, the company archives have seen even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to the settlement.
"You can see how much it is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are threatening to spread to Europe.
Then, when there will secure unprotected brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he was able to avert the registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the Council's lawyer stalemate hole German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China.
It was not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather the foreigners should register "everything which is somehow deserving, as well as in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, in the last act: if Freudenberg under his trademark drama, then we would have to pay royalties for its own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being pushed into the segment in question from the market.
