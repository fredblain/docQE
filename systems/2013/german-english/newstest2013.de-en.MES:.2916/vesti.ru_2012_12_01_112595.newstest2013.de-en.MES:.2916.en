Born in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or clash with killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with planet aboard on the search for a replacement.
To save humanity, the important question is how we can continue our plants in weightlessness or on the spare planet?
In my opinion, there is not a lot of choice.
In fact, there are only two real planet that we could live at least hypothetical.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
While the conditions on Mars, however, are relatively friendly, there is life on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in other words, all the possible.
The question of reproduction in all the researchers treated first in terms of the flora.
Already half a century earlier experiments have been carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of the difference in orbit bred peas are not in the least by the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more of the tiny fruit flies (), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study the impact of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It has developed a normal chicks.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chickens must be stopped; it must be able to stand on its feet and start to move," the director of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Vladimir Sychew explained.
Without a solid surface the chicks tripping over their tongues.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn fully.
The chicks responded to light and loud.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let slip chicks and made the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chicks in all records.
The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years ago in the orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only to be located on the bio-satellite "Bion" homosexual species.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been sent in the fertilized.
In principle, it was found nothing special.
"It was just the bio-satellites, but once again, it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," Vladimir Sychew noticed.
After the landing of the space rats were young.
The issue of reproductive directly in space could not resolve so far.
The task is a difficult one.
Animals, who will travel from their natural habitat cannot simply follow their reproduction.
In contrast to the human animals could in principle.
Homo sapiens is able to abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
From the ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying in all 50 years ago.
It was the biggest risk for Tereshkova.
The most valuable asset that has humanity, is the female body.
Our gull flew them, and no one on Earth could answer the following question: survives the space flight?
They will be able to bring a child into the world?
"After all, nobody answered that question," says veteran Wachtang Watschnadse space.
In June 1964, only a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew was also kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit, and even if work outside of the space vehicle gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where, after long flights everything went well, and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in orbit," cosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and concludes hero of the Russian Federation.
But humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and creating artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in the centre of the Cosmonaut is a mandatory stop during the flight preparation.
Here, in a state of flux the Cosmonaut routine win for the work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as a pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants water as a natural element.
It is, as the small Ichtyander would bear witness that life in the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the belly of the mother is in the water, and the water that it can then make it easier to get used to.
In principle, this is logical, since crime from birth to the first swimming just two weeks ago.
"This is too little time to forget about something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While the weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness is the belly and Beckenmuskulatur speed back and thus also takes the ability to press the child.
Well, we go through geburtseinleitende tools.
For example, the birth could also take place in a Spezialkammer, the child.
"But what happens then?," which is not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
Without having to feel the earth attraction, the organism can't form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in orbit as an adult to the training in a suit.
He is simply the absence of what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we make together, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment will mean that we will have a disabled person, a completely unadapted people to the world," the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for medical and biological problems, Igor Pestow, predicts.
So far, the birth of children in the world is all mere theory.
At some point, however, it will be a reality, when the earth's inhabitants to break into your space ships to a distant planet, which will be the home for their offspring born in all.
