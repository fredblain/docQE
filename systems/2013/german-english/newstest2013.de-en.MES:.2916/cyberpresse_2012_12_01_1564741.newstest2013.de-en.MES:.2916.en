Prostate cancer screening: the test should be made or not?
The PSA test on the way, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, but also with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to further delay the already indecisive men for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be made or not?
We have sought the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies carried out in the United States passed a number of spoilers between the control groups so that it is difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without screening.
The study also showed that the probability of the formation of metastases to 30-40% is higher in a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years ago, when there is no screening was carried out.
I therefore commend the test from the age of 50 years ago or 40 years ago, if one has a direct relatives, who had already been ill with prostate cancer.
In men Afro-American origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was detected.
There are cancers that aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient must be made to understand the extent of the risk of cancer, making the options will be presented to him, where Prostatakrebse can remain untreated, if it affects the quality of life in the long term, and it is in these cases, rather than for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men, where no one has detected cancer treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active surveillance and offers progression of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy determines the criteria for a decision as to who should be dealt with and who does not.
That is why I recommend, however, the implementation of the tests.
However, it is most important to talk with his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to assess the pros and cons of the PSA tests.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and would move.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," emphasises André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unresolved.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after abandoning the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, Grimmdarm, Mastdarm, oesophageal, pancreatic and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity throughout the life protects against colon cancer," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommended to limit the consumption of red meat.
It is too large quantities increases the risk of developing a Grimm or fattening colorectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The conservation of meat, smoked, dry or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
But their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While a study has found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu-sur-Mer stressed how important it is to speak with his doctor about his concerns and his family.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
