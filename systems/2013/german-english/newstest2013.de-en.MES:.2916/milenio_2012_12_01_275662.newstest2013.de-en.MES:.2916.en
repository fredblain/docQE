Cause of a dying of AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they were the result of the investigation confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success, "tried to weaken."
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to care only about his illness and started to inform; and this with such use, that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, a few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time it avoided even the director of a clinic of IMSS, to adopt, "because it led to a dead end."
Then AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people are still in the hospital, who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already caused damage and the immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, i.e. the emergence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of patients, which absorbs the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," the head of the HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva said, but he said that this information was based in April of this year from a respected scientific publication.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists inferred since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the extent of the deterioration of the immune system of people at the beginning of the treatment, and that those would have greater opportunities, which are not drug addiction: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a census of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean that anyone who gets in the age of 25 years ago, the diagnosis HIV-positive, in this sense, "can easily 75 years old, as long as it is under control," the expert said.
In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate has reduced significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who are dying of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 reduced in 2011 (annual report), it is nevertheless true that 60 percent of the national database collected patients have died since the release of AIDS.
Alone in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and until the month of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, rest assured that there is a universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- so why people are still dying out?
In my opinion, the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs, the problem is that people come in far advanced state, because they do not know their condition, i.e., in the very late stages of the disease.
He makes a compelling statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an accompanying infection in order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why all the people, where it is needed, need to be offered screening tests."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de si del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) to vote (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio, who had to carry out its test at a private laboratory, and this is the only reason, because it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS phase, and even the Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then three more times," says one in my case.
The change was to improve the, well, I am ernähre practise sport and take the medication.
Today, his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work a lot, but I have an active, responsible sex life, I am on my health and the other person," Fabrizio lists, which agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco, to encourage those who with his testimony today in the context of the world AIDS Day afraid.
You should make the test, if they belong to the risk group, the sooner you know whether you are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, they should learn how you can live like all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizens, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has adopted the cause of HIV said.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past, they were made separately, now you give us with hundreds of packages, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The risk of new infections among young people.
"Why do you need?" Is a question of widespread derision by social workers, guidance personnel in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system, who did not want to expose young people, the correspondent said.
He proposed to re-orient this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities, which are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
It should not be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms should be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality looks; it is best, the condoms closer to those who already have a sexual activity exercise," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (1.317 12.158 AIDS and HIV).
The state is seen nationally on 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in terms of HIV.
92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2%.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there is a case for every registered 4 or 5 persons who do not know it.
