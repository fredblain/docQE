The architects MVRDV prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books - 2 photos
"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is to see something interesting," says Verhaig, a Passantin on the roadside.
And, Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby says: "it is that house."
But I wonder what we still need a library.
All have Internet access, iPad and e-books.
No human being is voluntarily today in one of these old-style libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a little town on the outskirts of Rotterdam, sonderbarer record holder.
The 80,000 residents of community has the lowest rate of education throughout the Netherlands.
To curb this stupid circumstance, we decided a few years ago, contributing to the general education and to build the seven bridges that are displayed on the euro notes, as pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the offensive.
And so the city fathers recognized that there is only one way to become the statistics: a library.
, winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of bold bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings took the matter with their usual serenity and appeared at the hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury looked nonplussed and wincing with the armpits, Esspecially Freche Maas his exquisite gifts to the size of a pyramid and ended his speech with the words: "love an actionist founded municipality!"
In other words, that is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million mountain is dug up.
He is part of a revitalization project, which also include parking garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November the books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
So the faceless town retort that no longer had to offer so far as a post-modern pedestrian and an ugly town hall, behind whose white façades one would be inclined to suspect a Molkereifabrik, a piece of contemporary architecture is richer.
Above all, however, has now Spijkenisse on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: books Eldorado under glass.
There is a lift, which runs right through the mountains, but the real space and read the fußläufigen climb the topography.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and well-structured, the ceramic Klinkerboden and elegant street speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It already holds for banking, dog and soccer-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle of a large, dark space, which is usually way too expensive and impersonal," says winy Maas.
We have asked the classic space configuration upside down and read the area from the inside to the outside world.
The interior of the books is cleverly used: in the middle of offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and headquarters are located.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are wall panelling, parapet, rose close countries.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and engineers shake of the head.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse said, at the request of the standard.
And so we have encountered in a friesländischen farm of one day on a waste product from agriculture.
For many years, is used in the Netherlands in glasshouses and fields a thin plastic woven as the root surface.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two seasons, then it is ripe for the rubbish bins.
The fleece was pressed for the library - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, material that smells a little after new cars and a little after sports shoe.
After 105 steps one has reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journeys will be rewarded in the literary cafe, not only with a fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in the mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, yes, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Geheizt and chilled with geothermal energy.
Although the book is under a glass of fall, the sun itself seems just on sunny days in the interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder, which are across the glass facade, serve as shades and intercept a large part of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptics from the IT industry has already ventured to go the way of the new library.
Also Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM Lehrerin Cynthia Bogarde, who described the Boekenberg even as Spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: the opening of a few weeks ago, every resident has been invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
In order to be filled the gaps in the still not fully stocked library - currently 70,000.
The concept is absorbed.
The shelves are filled to obenhin.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
MVRDV succeeded so that those who are called in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
They also may be so young and uneducated.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
