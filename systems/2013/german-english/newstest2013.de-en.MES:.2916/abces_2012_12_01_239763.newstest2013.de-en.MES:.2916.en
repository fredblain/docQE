The hardest job in the world: the human work animals from Kawah Ijen
For four million to the winner of the Indonesian volcano your life and your health at risk if you have 70 kilos of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is hell, and other work word for word in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
He must rise every day, down to the bottom of the crater, where the gas out of the ground advance sulphur entrenched in contact with the air.
After he has extracted large stones, which can weigh a total of up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the stone paths.
Although there are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the need for more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, and they need to keep the balance and put their cautious steps, so that they are not slipping and crash.
You know that each step can cost lives, as a French tourist, who crashed a few years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miner from Kawah Ijen 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which they dismantle.
The path between the tourists who shoot like circus monkeys and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales that a mining company has set up a little further down at a height of 1850 metres
The company is PT Ngrimbi, which uses since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and never (better) said its workers, which pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and used in the manufacture of wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar.
"Because we are usually 70 kg, we will receive for each way about 46,000 rupees (3.8 million)," Anto, which normally three routes a day explained to us.
For each route he needs three hours that he is completely done, but at the end of the day, he then 138,000 breast cancers detected rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such an inhuman effort, but it is the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the miner here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 million) will be paid at the coffee harvest a day, and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 million) is very high," said the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer explained on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 million) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, returned, and for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, was coughing frequently and his eyes are due to the poisonous gases.
The 27-year-old Anto since three years of his life at the Kawah Ijen to play, whose sulphur when he left the first tracks, even though he covers his face with a mask and Spezialbrille.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, was coughing frequently and his eyes are due to the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I am going to work here two years ago, because I would like to invite you to make or to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This friendly and intelligent, but could work as a tourist guide of the life gestrafte young man, waiters or at the reception of the hotel, but instead he performed the work of a Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands at two o'clock every morning, because the sulphur coming out at night, where its characteristic yellow shines in the darkness.
The shadow challenging, he rises in the light of a small headlamps on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, in the crater.
About 400 on Kraterboden baskets with sulphur onto their shoulders.
Despite their large profits, the mining company does not reduce the sulphur mechanized, in order to save costs, and the media, the work on their own account and will be paid according to weight, no equipment.
You also get no share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 million) charge per camera, which the guardians of this nature parks demand, together with the entrance fee in the amount of 15,000 rupees (1.2 million) from the tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and human donkeys.
"This work is for the animals, and not for the people," Madrusin, an alert, 42-year-old carrier, which operates three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen protested.
He is in a position to contribute up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as there is" because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years old.
I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the eyes, throat and itching, if the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers in the thick pillars sticking up from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases... Of course, apart from the usual respiratory problems, Arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders of the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back is Unainik with its 53 years used to be able to contribute 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which will be transported by three trucks on a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in the absence of some teeth.
The oldest of his five children with his 30 years, also works as a sulphur-makers.
Time passes, but the meagreness generation to generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who work as human load donkey on Kawah Ijen.
