A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The Republican leadership forces justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
However, of the Brennan Center for the latter is a myth, confirmed that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The law, lawyers, the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
One thing is certain: the new rules will negatively affect the turnout.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In this sense, these measures are part of the democratic system of the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
In contrast to Canada, the US federal states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, announced new laws, the procedures for the registration and the ballot box.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which the new Republican leaders in 26 states.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
As a result, 180 law drafts were introduced in 2011, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The new election laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of the US State of citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In addition, these laws also shortens the time periods for the early vote, the right to void the election day to register as voters, and State denied citizens the right to vote, for which a court file.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Before the elections of 2006, no US state has asked voters to show a photo ID.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Indiana was the first federal state, which has made such a request.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed that the constitutional law of Indiana in 2008.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other countries.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Over the last two years, fostered in 34 states, federal law drafts, which forced the voters to produce a photo ID.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In fact, 11% of US citizens, 21 million voters people no photo ID card issued by a governmental authority of their state.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
However, often pay more than a hundred dollars to get the required identification.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected low-income young people, minorities and people.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with an income of less than $35000, 18% of people over 65 years, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
This goes further.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The students, who are seen as voters increasingly cast their vote for Democratic candidates, it is not allowed in several states to use their from their establishment issued photo ID.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting, more for the Republican side of the cards issued by these clubs to use for elections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Before 2004, a federal state, has called for dialing a proof of the State of citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Arizona was the first federal state, introduced such a requirement.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their US state citizenship.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
These measures clearly are intended to limit the Hispanic votes.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted in 2011 in eight federal states laws with the registration of voters on election day.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups, those voters who want to register.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
These restrictions are not without consequences.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Example of the campaigns to register voters in the general election in 2004 helped to register some 10 million state citizens.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other federal states, which aim to shorten the period for early voting.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Examples were in the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the federal state.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
In contrast, the White, 76% of voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Several drafts law were blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
They were able to limit the damage.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the submission of a photo ID.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Democratic critics point to the partisan nature of the laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the crucial states for 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted such laws, 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
It is too early to confirm with certainty that the legal provisions of these changes to the electoral system have a significant impact on the outcome of presidential elections in 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the turnout.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
In this sense, these measures are part of the democratic system of the United States.

Prostate cancer early identification: the test should be done or not?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The PSA-wise, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This leads to a greater reluctance of men already undecided for the implementation of screening tests.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The test should be done or not?
</seg>
<seg id="5">
We have sought the opinion of two doctors.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and to give clear recommendations.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
This study has also shown that a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of age, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30-40% higher when no screening was carried out.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
I therefore recommend that the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when one has a direct relatives, which was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
There is also a higher risk in men, Afro-American origin.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer was identified.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There are cancers that are aggressive and others, the indolent.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The patient really needs to be made to understand the extent of the risk of their cancer, giving him the possible options, which if left untreated prostate cancer types, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, an active surveillance of the disease.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Today, many of the men, which has cancer detected no treatment because their cancer is aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They are proposing an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who is not.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of the disease
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy life, the best way to reduce the risk of him.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and get enough.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"If there would be no more smoking, would increase the value of at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
However, it is assumed that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Several remain completely unclear.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It is also a risk factor for several types of cancer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
It harms the health of the people.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"Today there are still regrets in Quebec, 1.5 million smokers," the spokesman André Beaulieu.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The weight
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
According to the Canadian Cancer Society also overweight and obesity, the outbreak of the disease.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
They seem to increase the risk for breast, colon, rectal examination, feeding tubes, pancreas and uterine cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life against colon cancer," he adds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
The diet
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In them, it increases the risk of a Grimm or fattening colorectal cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Sausages should also be avoided.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Vitamins
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin additives and cancer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Their studies are not conclusive.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
While the study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer showed another increase.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also not yet clear.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is to talk about his concerns and his family Vorbelastung with his doctor.

The Higgs Boson analyzed
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs-Bosons has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It is believed that the Boson is nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And finally, it is the last particle predicted by the Standard Model - our best or the least wrong " explanation of the nature and behavior of matter whose existence - but not empirically observed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs Boson is very similar.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data were presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data yet to be completely secure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
We assume that it is indeed the Higgs is deceiving, because apparently only a low risk, and let us look at what is at stake.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
In this world, there is an inevitable standard law meant that two objects can be both at the same place.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It is not possible to violate this rule, and try not to, because you are hurt.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Even if the particle physics is a really weird world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same quantum state ", a " condition " on the whole, consists of some of its properties.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The physicists share the particles into two categories.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In one corner are good citizens, who are known as fermions and suddenly obey the Pauli principles.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And in the other, the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, whom nothing is sacred, not in any case, this principle, which means that they are, in fact, at the same time, at the same place.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
These bosons are divided according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the meso, we will not deal with the "force particles", the great forces of nature, and which would be the Higgs Boson, somehow.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
However, it must be stressed that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, such as one might think.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
If you are able to read this history, it is only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the photon, or light particles, " this is the " messenger " of electromagnetic force.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge faster or change the direction of the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" at this place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
This "disturbing" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "bearers of the force."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
More stable field
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs field, "disrupted" must be the Boson.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen can reach very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, with a surface that could be a very large rocks spall.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
That is why a giant particle accelerator is needed - as CERN's Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve the kind of energy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It is not, in fact, all the particles and not all of the materials, which interact with the magnetic field.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - example of a sheet of paper would never think of themselves in the refrigerator.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
And not all of the particles, the Higgs field: those who do interact, have a mass, while the others (such as the photon) have no mass.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
What all this research can be "good", asks Ms Plamondon?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The review of the Standard Model (SM) for science, and they also enable physicists to examine all the discrepancies between the observations and predictions of SM.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
There are many physicists hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference to open a door to a "new physics" and there might be some holes of the model.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It must be said that the latter is still flawed, as it offers no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, about 80% of the matter of the universe (re-ups!).
</seg>
<seg id="32">
However, CERN such deviations were not found until now.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Impact
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The impact of this research for the general population is difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the bell-labs would not suspect that their work such a revolution.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (1962, were the first pulsed) has already said - that the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gimmick" in the beginning.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Imagine...
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
Applications can also result from all the instruments, surrounded by the research.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Example has developed, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969, during his work in optics, a small light sensor.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Although it was not the original purpose of the sensor is now all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know....

This very serious shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several doctors specializing in palliative care, look forward to the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which has been signed by prominent figures of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express its opposition to any such initiative.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system is not capable of Quebec's performance enough to ensure that all of the right to have a high-quality palliative care before it is accepted on euthanasia.

Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room without has taken measures to alleviate.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I am afraid that the patients are dying simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions hard until the last day.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has an arduous chemotherapy.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
When I told my oncologists that I will stop the treatment, she replied that they regret giving up the fight, told them.

<seg id="56">
However, she had told me that I was at the end!

<p>
<seg id="57">
No omnipotent care
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, to thank the medical staff that it is not granted this request, after the pain of a team of palliative care.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
But it must be said that the palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care society of domestic palliative care of Greater Montreal 8% of patients do not speak of a pain treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
At the very end of life, doctors often rely on terminale sedation, the patients either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death einzuschläfern.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
We can no longer pretend that this side of suffering.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Patients without pain relief are increasingly resorting to these terminale sedation.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Patients whose pain is not all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
</seg>
<seg id="65">
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want to put me," but "I want my pain."

"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
How do you explain this progress?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
There are great players.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Every day I am on their side of progress.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
These elements gives me every day to improve my game.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And in a game that is even easier.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In football, everything happens very quickly.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
But I break in enthusiasm.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
I have always been gradual progress since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my game time at Saint-Etienne.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Thus, the competition from Carlo Ancelotti introduced advantage...
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The new additions this summer are used to a very high level.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They also know that each training unit.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This means that a player like me to stand up and do the best.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my game.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Of course.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Ancelotti instills respect all technicians.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no other person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He had contact with great players.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
I think he will win another title in Paris.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The trust he has placed in me, as well as an explanation for my services.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
What do you think of the first part of the season of the PSG?
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the frontrunner.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
But lurking in the ambush.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
One of our main objectives is the Champions League, we have qualified for the final.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
We will try to get as far as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
From now on, everything is possible.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
However, we will have a very good European teams our input.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
First of all, we want to be first in our group of Porto, so that we can fight for the return leg of the Achtelfinales as a home game.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
The PSG in the short term a major European club?
</seg>
<seg id="39">
He has already had its budget...
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In order to become a major European club must win the Paris title and make a name for the long term.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
This is not the case today.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Financially, the PSG resources so that this project taking shape.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
It would be a major failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
This year, it is really important to us, the cream of this title.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
We were close last season.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
We have finished with 79 points.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Normally you should be champion with 79 points....
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I believe that this year is the right one.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
Do you think that the media too much from the PSG?
</seg>
<seg id="55">
In the light of what has been invested, and the players we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
We accept that.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
However, if we are in a home match against Troyes win 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us, that is definitely a little frustrating.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
One wonders what people expect.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
We never could win every weekend with a 4-0.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
We are not the FC Barcelona!
</seg>
<seg id="61">
We are trying to establish a game plan.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
A team builds over time.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, fails to qualify for the final, and also has huge expenditures.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
In relation to the sums invested was believed to break with 15 points ahead!
</seg>
<seg id="66">
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season of the new PSG "geboostet."
</seg>
<seg id="68">
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.

<seg id="69">
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling victors and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
The PSG appears to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
The better that people speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
</seg>
<seg id="72">
This means that Ibrahimovic performance is strong and many goals.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Within the team, we respect both the player and person.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
He also respects the people who surrounded him.

We have a good position in the group qualification for the World Cup.

The national coach is strictly, the players and stimulates the victory.
</seg>
<seg id="92">
As it was Laurent Blanc.

<seg id="93">
But I would not.

<seg id="94">

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt

It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.

<seg id="3">
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily divided the unlimited power of attorney granted more than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly to approve its final version, the next day.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Just a week ago, the head of the State House was granted two extra months to the end of his work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Egypt is based now for almost two years on a temporary, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and lead to a legal mess.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This new initiative has a greater division of the country.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
For his opponents to the President in his " autocratic delirium, " he breaks his word " and " the right underfoot. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
On the side of his supporters, you can rest assured that it is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
A referendum should be held within 14 days.

85 mostly Islamist members of the constitutional assembly yesterday, the text adopted in a strange atmosphere.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned away, as they believe that they have not been able to put their views.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
To achieve the quorum yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy Members added.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Some of the Muslim brothers.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... the time has come for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the clock of the constitutional assembly was not exactly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The text adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, all that remains is identical to that of the constitution of 1971, and says that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The Salafist parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement had hoped to replace the "principles" by the "rules", which would have a stronger application.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed, proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"Hypocrisy," say the liberals, who see it as propaganda.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
For them, according to the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
They are particularly Article 220 in the eye of the Al-Azhar University, an advisory role, particularly in relation to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because " the people who will be asked to comment on it, have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The fears of the Liberals will also be fuelled by the fact that the next chancellor of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
" There is currently no specific religious commitment.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no Ulema, but academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, " appeased Alexis Blouet writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But he admits that " in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity, because the terms of the religious vocabulary.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
This applies in particular to the "fiqh," [Islamic jurisprudence terminal Red.].
</seg>
<seg id="38">
And in the future could be raised the question of civilian judges are competent to decide. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday strongly criticized the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will not be submitted to the parliament, but a national NDC.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
There will also be a ban on civil cases in military courts, as requested by the associations for the defence of human rights.
</seg>

The latter also share their fears in the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression, freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Furthermore, no article refers to the protection of women, underscores Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.

<seg id="18">
First and foremost, we should these silly virtual reality helmets!

- What do you think of voice control?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It is popular, but it will not be overrated?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
- She is certainly not the solution which can solve all the problems, because it raises questions about privacy, because people do not want to inform all others on his actions and intentions.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Is any kind of interaction with computers, but their particular niche.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
For example, we worked in the field of the management of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight, with sprawling gestures.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but from a bracelet registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It is still quite big, but it could in theory be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
But overall, the future is mixed control types, example, gestures and language.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
- How do it?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
- We would like to ask, for example, this Sprudeldose?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
They say it and interpret it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
- Normally, I will say it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
- hot, you want the user adapt to what can be a machine at the time and what is not?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
I think that we need to work in the near future, especially in the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to collect the reactions of people.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
This could be a laser sensors, for example, in the depths of a good resolution, which is very important.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
- Which claims you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
</seg>
<seg id="37">
There is a lack of resolution, or something else?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Of course, an 8 megapixel would not be bad at a speed of 1000 fps.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the Matrix and depth.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
So all current technologies are not good enough, because the developers of the algorithms have more work for us.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
It is not only the dissolution of the X and Y, but also along the Z-axis.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The speed and the number of frames per second are important.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The movements of the people are very dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 fps, particularly for gestures are not enough.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a touch sensor adjustable processing delay between 1-100 milliseconds, whereas the current commercial sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Not all understand how much influence the interaction between man and machine.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
I, for my work as a device, only without the light touch controls and more frames per second.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
- must not increase the number of cameras?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
- Kinect is currently working with three cameras, one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
And the third camera is actually a RGB camera.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
They are not used to calculate the object.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
More cameras could solve the problem...
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Or the problem as more calculations.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera tendencies to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, not his glasses to the public.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life, the lens has the best prospects?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
- Of course, it is not pleasant, always on the road to a smartphone in the hand, but I think: the best option would be a "temporary" enhanced reality, we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone,
</seg>
<seg id="58">
The lens is a personal gadget, and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but at the same time its weakness to prevent a broader reality through glasses, you can work together with others in virtual objects.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
- Imagine us for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air, not just Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
There is a problem that critics often point out this idea: there is no tangible response.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
The hands feel nothing at all!
</seg>
<seg id="62">
The answers to these objections, give your group?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
- In my lectures, I often talk of the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
An interesting method is the use of second-hand unusual projection surface.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It is perfectly true pressure!
</seg>
<seg id="67">
But there are also technologies, which are designed to give the pictures in the air, something tangible, " for example, the interference of some targeted ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger, a feeling that at the moment but there is still so weak as someone spitting on the palm.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
There are also bands for the wrist on the Nervenendungen in your fingers, it is also a potential direction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">
- Have you tried to outflank the brain?
</seg>
<seg id="70">
We think that it can feel what it should, if it is just something?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">
- This is a good idea, so we have not yet been tried.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
Here is another challenge, we will still have to fight a man physically located in a closed room to believe that he is, instead, in an open, virtually infinite space; we have been working on concepts with treadmills (other than in the gym), mobile platforms and large balls.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
So far, the brain can only fool, and we still have many years of working.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
The work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: on many issues, we are only at the beginning.

Our own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Rosbalt, the project, "Peters Burger avant-garde", which is dedicated to city dwellers, who are the avant-garde art and culture.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
On the list of already high-ranking representatives of the Peters burger scene that go beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe without having to be known in the rest of Russia.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-clad Bärtigen, the Russian Museum, in the summer garden, scene-meeting or exhibitions.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also attract large crowds.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Peters Burger social philosophical artists to create new myths.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of Peters Burger avant-garde end of the 80s and early 90s.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He is also a man of the city and puts a smile to the faces of his presence on the street with his fellow citizens and provides them with good humour.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and was finally ready to Peters Burger Drehorgelspieler because it for this difficult role in terms of its artist existence, its philosophy and its image.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Kirill, why are you always in red, and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
I have chosen the color red, a fashion designer with the optics and image.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In the company of everything, which differs from the norm, aggression and bad behavior.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But I want my provocations with the people.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Each of my last provocation was an invitation to talk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
- When you knew that you have to become a painter?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
- In an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Newskij were exhibited in my work.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I realized that I have to go down this path.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Then I went to the time of the old-free, but not officially recognized as a painter at the time, and new and free painters were incomprehensible.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
I befriended the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; hence, "Pushkinskaya 10", and then once was.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
For me, theater, fashion, music, actually everything, except the literature.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
- And all the united in your Art Clinic... - It was important to me to be at the heart of the Peters burger culture, where the best creative artists.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In 1995, occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and then there were up to the renovation of a musical and artistic club for bohemia, the house of Peters Burger Bohemians.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz and I remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Wireless and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and belonged to the now trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
When the group started to play live, was removed from her "Leningrad".
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Costumes mountain moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
We gave them costumes mountain and began his career, but he learned the basics.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Even the gallery "d 137" or the "Griboedov" club have their origin in the Art Clinic.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
There, our employees and regulars.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In the year 2000, there were in the press, a survey of the "people of our city."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
"I won in the category of" artist of the year, and I was at the peak.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
It is not easy to work under the old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
Your work - have a distinctive style.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
- Many of my pictures are real pearls, and clearly the timeliness and sharpness of the idea.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
I will have an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as a clown."
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Clowns are timeless.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
I used to be socially, but now it hurts and fear.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
In a clown blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Save the world by stipulating that any fully.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Now all the clothes and is based on the outside and not on the inside.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
But perhaps we should not a people's hands, but he spit in the face.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The deception will disappear by the panel.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
- Before we saw recently in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers. - An urban culture should have a hero.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Who, if not me?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
- Can be commercial art?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
- These days, commercial art must be cautious, respectful and flattering.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Previously, the large groups of people: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Now there are micro-communities, and it is hard to please everyone.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
I am not a one-hundred-dollar note each.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Now you will have to consider, whom thou shalt.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Now every cult star has about 100 supporters.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
- Among the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
- Among women abandoned him, the sexually-social sphere plays a role.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
For cultural reasons, about 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money and everything.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not destroy what has been achieved.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
In my youth, I painted these pictures, even for a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">
Today, there are many misunderstandings.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who were living in poverty and died in poverty and refused to paint.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
This is the culture that I support.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">
- Kirill what Peters Castle is missing?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
- Good culture experts.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
They say: servant of the culture.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
But not all of them can deal with culture.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
The real czar was different, because the Tsar might not seem like a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
In Peters Castle, we have what could be the experts, but they closed off the road, as it requires senior experts, the former properly evaluate them the way.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
Now only one's own taste.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say that they do not accept all of the contemporary art and some painters, therefore, have to find other museums.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">
- What is Peters Castle for you?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
- Peters Castle is not the Capital of Culture in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
Art is difficult to grow on our stones.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
We need a cultural realm because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
In Europe, there are many people who are curious to visit the exhibitions and concerts.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
We are much less.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.

We have only very few cosmonaut, a long flight, everything went well and they got healthy offspring.

"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.

While the weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
In a state of weightlessness, the abdomen and pelvic muscles rapidly, and thus the ability to extract the child.

Well, we deal with birth introductory tool.

On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.

"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied right - and I think that this is not the case," said Kala, the current situation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
A similar outcome seems a common control by Czech and German auditors.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
As an example of bad practice, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "black" system.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls, the system is prohibited or allowed?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"A law has to be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, it is not just the government, and chairman of the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work," says Kala.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the two countries ' laws on public contracts were compared with each other.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
What did it mean?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
It is a parallel examination, we started about two years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature determines how to handle public contracts to build national legislations. And finally, there is the practical application.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
All of this, we have compared with each other, and while the review is not yet complete, we could see extremely interesting differences, generally speaking, the laws are perhaps a little " rigorous and perfect, but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more detailed rules. We must also deal with the actual application of the law.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
How can it help? What is for you from this project?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
We are such a joint control could help stop a perfecting of laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds, if that is obviously not very good.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and illegal enrichment and criminal acts.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
It may even be so that the system is only in this way with the "paperwork" and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
How does the control system in Germany?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The authorities, as is the German equivalent of the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us, and also has a college is just a little different. In principle, the two authorities, however, are similar.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The skills are similar to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, which means that there is this billing courtyards in the individual federal countries - the German system is different from ours.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
The BRH can only control of federal funds, which corresponds to our state.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Public funds are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the country's courts billing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
As regards the German legislation is easier than ours?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Generally, I would be without specific details are reluctant to compare. Nichtsdestoweniger Germany is often referred to as a model in some ways, but you cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
Perhaps that is because the auditors are better?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
This, but as I said: I don't particularly like to such comparisons.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It should be noted that those countries that have a role model, also with problems.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, right?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
As regards the Czech legislation, the importance of your administration, the revision of the law granting you feel any impact?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Given that this novel is only a short time in power, it has so far our tests have not yet.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Because after our controls are in place, we should expect some delays.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
We feel effects in the preparatory phase of future inspections, we have introduced the new control instrument "recognition of the risks of inefficiency," and with this nearly 14000 public contracts examined and analysed the impact of changes, of course, because the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of alerts were modified
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
You see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with additional bureaucracy?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
It is the problem, however, that the rules are "harder" and cannot be met.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Under the previous rules are put to the test persons to the medium (example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the regional council) accountable for any non-compliance with the procurement law is a violation of the budgetary discipline.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
However, it is worthwhile to make the law more stringent?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
I do not think that way.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack the system and abuse, and not to punish those who have committed a form of error does not affect the actual decision-making.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
Where is the solution?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
We say, first of all, what is not.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs do not bother with the controls of the so-called "black" - what does that mean exactly?
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The system is prohibited or allowed?
</seg>
<seg id="49">
A law has to be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, it is not just the government, and chairman of the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
He can say: "we change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we are acting as if nothing would.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain events - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
On the other hand, but it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid simply because of defects is excluded.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied right - and that is what is missing, in my opinion.

Originally from me, then, we have developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.

Five of our members are wheelchair users need wheelchairs are carried in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have many instruments suitcase and other luggage mitschleppen...

<seg id="43">
Nichtsdestotrotz has always worked without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I sometimes partly understood.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
Your travel abroad, you have a settlement in the various countries with accessibility, as they deal with disabled people, etc.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
How have you seen these things?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were witnesses in Russia, in the East is still in its infancy.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
To Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, alone in the city centre is on the way, it is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
It is not obvious that a wheelchair user example, in the elevator vorlässt.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Fortunately, there are clubs try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
There are still many things on which we are still lagging behind...
</seg>
<seg id="53">
However, an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of those concerned.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities themselves in public space, go to the museum, toilets etc.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
But it is not usual for a larger group of disabled people actively involved in the public arena, with the band The Tap Tap the West a little.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only after significant athletes from our midst, artists, actors, politicians and law, lawyers, things really begin to change.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
So far, these are only isolated cases of strong personalities of goodwill.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
The Tap Tap is very popular, but if we go back a few years, what has motivated in 1998 to form a band?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
Then I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people, who were keen to deal with.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
And since I am a musician and saxophone playing, I have founded, together with a colleague, a music-AG.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
Oh, and, over time, as our host, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say anything to get out of hand. (laughs).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
The band was known, but only in the last few years, I am wrong?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
It is true that helped us cooperation with well-known singers; we have also begun to campaign actively for us.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
We have realised that and it is not visible to the outside one's own performance in a certain sense, does not exist.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
Thanks to EU funding, we can also provide good editors, high-tech equipment and the like.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
It was your intention to bring it with The Tap Tap so far?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">
From the outset, I sensed the potential that we can approach things differently.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
In the show business often copied today one of the other.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
This is logical, because everything new is viewed with caution and take longer to accept.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
The first impression that most of the audience is, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
</seg>
<seg id="72">
But that sympathy is entirely superfluous because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature, which we regret.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
There are people who live a full life and can develop if they have the necessary funds.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
I always say that if people with disabilities can not only for myself, it is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a strict boss, we hear from many people?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="76">
If you want to do something good, you can make any compromises on many things, and also has a certain discipline.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
I think this is completely normal.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week, test preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, that enthusiasm quickly extinguished.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
It works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">
Currently, The Tap Tap 20 members.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
How many of those were from the outset, since 1998?

</p>

<seg id="82">
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.

Poland and the space.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Last week, Poland was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the 20th member of the Space Agency, Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (according to the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008, ESA member).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Poland began in 1994, close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and took part in the following years several ESA projects.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Poland's path to space began much earlier, however.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos with space travel, not always met with understanding.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I remember the example of the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, the observatory at the idea of the author from his pioneering work "entrance to the Outer Space Exploration".
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905), the audience, however, and after years remembered Šternfeld that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Šternfeld won in 1934 for entrance to the Outer Space Exploration " donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix REP-Hirsch.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote several books on the scientific disciplines.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Gadomskis worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space was honored by the fact that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
In 1925, was built in Poland, a rail trolley for a rocket.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
It is not even clear whether the rocket will be used to start or the brakes of the trolley.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The research work, the institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is clear from the documents that the research was up to the stage of practical tests.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
In 1937, appeared in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, the "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Both projects related to the military use of the rocket propulsion.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology, coordinated by the person who was passing the scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of his work was the start of the war.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Published another article on space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrt (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The first mention of the company in 1954 in the November edition of the journal Problemy, in the space of four long articles.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The article by Prof.M. Subotowicz proposes establishing a Raumfahrt society.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At that time, there would be the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
In its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrt society PTA to accede to the International Federation for space travel was founded in 1951, and indeed the PTA was due in the autumn of 1956.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The following year became the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space flight.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
He was president until his death in 1959.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Since 1956, the PTA instrumental in the development of highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The first type, the RM 1, was completed in 1957, the first starting on October 10, 1958.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959 and began in the desert Blęd flight tests with the two-phased missile RM 2.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
A further development stage should be able to provide real scientific work, the rocket RM 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km, and for the observation of altitude winds.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
However, in 1962, was set to further development.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Successor to the first missiles RM the meteor was developed in the years 1962-1965-1 rocket.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The rocket was designed as a two-phased missile, its overall length was 510 cm and weight was 32.5 kg.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
This rocket have developed three types (Meteor-1A, 1B and 1c states), which are distinguished from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 litres capacity, meteor-1B 0.34 liters and Meteor-1c states about 0.62 litres.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The maximum altitude of all three types of 37 km.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
In the years 1965 to 1968, was developed in the aviation institute the meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg, at an altitude of about 60 km.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
The versions of meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Also worth noting is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, two years later, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek was second astronaut.

The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Last week, the constitutional court, the Law on charitable work.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This decision in the public a lively discussion.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with one another.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, with rampant speculation goes hand in hand.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) price tensions.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Under this concept is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to pass through the importation of cheaper goods in economic competition, the "offer" competition, in order to grab a bigger share of the market and to increase its profits.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their manufacturing abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Private capital because no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rise in unemployment caused, the state spending.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This situation is compounded by the fact that the men are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and to replace the overall social, economic and social damage.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The reckless practice of private capital into the economies of a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The aim of these measures is forcing its people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
This is done by economic duress in long-term unemployment, by limiting the rights of workers.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In Germany there for several years, public Lebensmittel levy for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The number of people who are already in the millions.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the wake of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy are cases in which workers get such low wages that the state to increase their income to the subsistence level.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of the German Bundestag auxiliary staff employed.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The austerity of practically all EU-South will undoubtedly run into the same state where people are under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century, it was the case), or for a pittance left to languish on the margins of society, and to hope that at some point, private investment capital is flowing into the country.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Nature here is the question of where the capital?
</seg>
<seg id="26">
If it is from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains completely, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, the employees are working for a fraction of the wages of Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
This applies to all of Latin America.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam that the State should not capital on its own people, economy, and that the economy will lead to economic disaster.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Private capital narrow insists on its position that the state is not allowed to directly intervene in the economy.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Then you have to wonder whether or not the private capital, the politics and the entire state in its own selfish sense or even.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Here is the unequivocal answer: yes.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual unmistakably, legislation is practically everything, but nothing criminally punishable by law.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department in the absence of private finance, dense with industry interrelated law firms charged with drafting legislation.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
All the violence is not more popular as Western constitutions, but strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Obviously, the liberal democracies have been fast in a situation like the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey ': " the state has long been in decay, and the offices occupied by force.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Against bribes, illegal Erschleichung of benefits or with stone and sword.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Corruption has grown unchecked, and the people with already bought votes for the election, "... " people with character applied for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul "... " it began to really talk about it, that is the only medicine a rule in this difficult situation, and that should be a strong man "... Appian thinking at Pompey, but the strong man was Caesar, democracy permanently replaced by the one-man rule.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
As it turns out, today's society is based, as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, not paying attention to the overall interests of society.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to see the advantage for the whole of society.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The result, now as then, is one of the decadence of the elites, not the slightest concern for deeper reforms.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we must look at the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The current state of affairs, the downfall of this regime can be seen as a certain pause in favor of liberal democracies, in the next round.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites to the possible future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, which we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The repeal of the law on charitable work is no solution, at least not lasting.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition in the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to find ways to reduce the level of social security of the population.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
This trend is therefore system.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
The only solution is a targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital into the company in favor of the state.

The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world's central banks and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they were wars, or are these (before the invasion of Afghanistan in 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were five countries after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, while Russia has in the meantime, its central bank of the Russian government).

The global appetite for power led to the Rothschilds in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert spades, Freemasons in the 33 and the highest degree of knowledge.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The first war was aimed at the big royalist European states to eliminate the second war, in particular, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and luxury and would not consume so many resources), to create a universal religion (the Ökumenismus here is nothing more than the first) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power.

The film Argo: if it is the worst, Hollywood
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating occupied Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
For their release, they called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the US, which had for decades, the patronage of his regime.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
For the US government had no positive way out of this situation, it could not afford to throw the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
At the same time, it was not in a position in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States and the subsequent failure of hostage-freeing the violent attempt made things worse.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The fate of the hostages phoned home to a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.

The combination of genres

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The plan, developed by the experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The camouflage was credible, published articles about the film project in professional journals, held press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called "Caper movie", that is the story of a successful feat as example, the film Ocean's Eleven.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
This change in the movie the mood levels, on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations.

<seg id="21">
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and it is easy to exaggerate.

<seg id="24">
A spokesmen ridiculed actor has become a respected director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Argo is his third feature film after the thriller No breeze (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
</seg>
<seg id="26">
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film not in the native Boston by director.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the previous films, the director of the Hollywood standard.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Affleck, however, is also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The best scenes of the film to play in the streets and the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the sequence of the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, yet conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that comes when somewhere even history.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
A similar effect, Affleck and his team also fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Too much in too many places
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
The director had to face the fact that the story is not a lot of exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
With a few works but quite successfully, reality sometimes nachhilft - which is not always so elegantly acts (the scenes of the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or the persecution of hunting on the runway, artificial).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is caused by the need to have too much to act in too many places.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, their characters but deserved more space, and that they are in the film by no means alone.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
Afflecks movie loses a little traction, it is a movie with some interest, and the design and reminiscent of a thriller from the 1970s retro-style approve.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Enthusiasm, it is very difficult.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
As a reminder of a living piece of history in some way, and as evidence of how the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is sufficient.

The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey about the oddest of bank charges, this year, has decided to hold the competition "most absurd regulation or idea of the EU's workshop."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
"This idea that brought us the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organisation of this survey, the newspaper Právo.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Among the nominated absurdities example is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are objectively for the insurance companies are less of a risk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
" More incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, " said Nacher.

<seg id="8">
The controversial EU regulations including the mandatory blending of ethanol fuel, which is harmful to nature in its aftermath, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometer, just because this is a relatively small amount of the dangers of substance, or the directive on size of chicken cages for egg this year were much more expensive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The comment drew criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "Butteraufstrich" or the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.

Bananas must be 14 inches long

The EU machine, often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in the rule of one or more member countries in Brussels (Czech Republic is currently trying example, including with veto threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Lobbying interests were also that bananas from the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 inches long, and not an "anomaly" curvature.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The European Commission defended with the argument that they only to harmonise the different national standards that would impede trade.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries that the directives would lead to a loss of life.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons in the sale must be equipped with warnings that children under eight years of the balloon puffed up without the supervision of an adult.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The EU, citing an American study, according to the balloons are the leading cause of the drowned children.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
There are also curious incursions at home
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
It is quite absurd, a directive that concerns the European officials - everyone in the EU, an official function, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece not to use the name Macedonia and FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities of the EU regulation on the scope of life resources stocks on the territory of a member country.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The EU set the maximum volume of life resources stocks, on the day of our accession to the EU on the territory of the Czech Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the specified volume of canned mushroom, for which threatened a large fine.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive the money that they do not have the sea, or from the idea of funding for applications for funding.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
These ideas came not from Brussels but from Prague.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
" We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.

<seg id="26">
We will be asking for a refund in the EU, " said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.

<seg id="27">
As he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the crowded government camps as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
As the Czech Republic have another way to sea ports, should pay the Palas hundreds of millions of euros.

The European Commission, the Czech Republic was so well that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.

EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Regulations will easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, hence, effectiveness and the development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, more recognition in the member countries.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
In the opinion of a deeper problem, experts are more EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, together, but they have been forced by individual member countries in the budget negotiations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Emotions in this country calls the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and not always wins this battle.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
The Czech Republic could defend the designation " Olomoucké tvarůžky ' after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers to rename in " Tuzemák. "
</seg>

"The people want me to save the republic, but I am just an amateur," said Okamura.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Mr Senator, how is the idea to run for president?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
I am not trying to be a senator or president.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
If everything would work without any problems in our country, I would be standing anywhere.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But I can't see the Republic plundered for 20 years, as thieves are free, while increasing people's taxes and the retirement age.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
But if I see something I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
And while I am over 40, independent and party-less, I have no other way to influence things, to run for senator or president.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
In the Senate, you have done it, and then on the way to the castle.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
You return to your constituents?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
I said to myself the whole time that I will fight for the castle by the outcome of Senate elections.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Later, I have this and said that I shall be a candidate for the office of President, if I am elected senator.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
My goal is not the function of the function is an instrument with which I realized my vision.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I need as much influence and a strong mandate.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But the problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television, but the change.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The media, the one who want to steal the honor and confuse the freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
About me example said that I would impress journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
We are talking about your vision.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The battle for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retrospective assets declarations about 20 million crowns.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
You have to change the laws.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole will have the law.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
How do you solve this problem?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
As a simple citizen, I have argued that the guide remains a free trader, and this could be enforced.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal is rejected, this intentionally, and that keeps the population.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
As an independent party-less, I have a much greater potential to win support from all the political parties represented in parliament.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of each party can take what is best for our country.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
You see a man in politics to the right or left?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
This right-left thinking, but it is completely irrelevant to me.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
For me, it is important that we move forward.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
It is not a question of whether someone on the left or the right, I would like to connect people.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
I am always publicly any good solution approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or ODS, and I will oppose bad ideas.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
It bothers you when someone described as populists.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
But you have not, what you just said?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have an ideal destination and a vision.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
And you would like this.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
This may well be described as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to function in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
But without support in Parliament, you just keywords.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
And in the long-term policy.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk with the people will be able to enforce the material and criminal liability example?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
I have no other option.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
To convince politicians, journalists and the public, and to try to bring them to our side to enforce these goals.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
As president, there would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and state attorneys.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
And the Angesprochenen would possibly say why they oppose it.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
A strong personality to abuses can exert pressure on the political scene.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Take the direct election of the president, who was a credit to the public pressure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
I say very clearly that I am an amateur, I am neither a genius nor a intellectuals.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
I just started with the policy and try to find the majority of the support for my program.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
I always try to assess the things themselves, and if it doesn't work, then I go back six years in the private sector.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
That sounds a little as if Okamura, should be saved.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
I am not a savior.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
I know that I do nothing; that is why I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether they want to run for the Senate.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
I have spoken with, for example, Radim Jančura but congestion because of work.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
I have also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová fraud on trade, with light heating oil.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">
My candidacy, I started with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Sixty percent of the eligible voters went to the elections, and those who are generally elected representatives of the establishment.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
Do you think about setting up your own party?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
I have not thought about it, because I don't have time to review the past any potential party member, and don't have the money.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
I have no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only 20000 CZK.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">
They have no money?
</seg>
<seg id="65">
They speak of wealth statements, what would your?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
I value my private assets to about 60 million.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million art collection, which is about 10 million is worth, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu superb, approximately one million worth, and then I have a few million in the bank account.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
The Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond I liked, like he was in the car, galant on women and fighting against evil.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">
You are driving an Aston Martin, has a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
</seg>
<seg id="70">
You say that you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
This is not very convincing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
Should I do about debt?
</seg>
<seg id="74">
I have 2.5 million into the campaign.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program probably not too much interest.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
And I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
The cost of the campaign are in fact covered by my salary as a senator.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
But the senators salary, I could not live alone; for example, my son, I could not finance the English school, which costs 30000 per month.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
If I just wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing at all.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">
So, you as an entrepreneur, to have your livelihood?
</seg>
<seg id="81">
You said that you drive back these activities?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
But that is not dependent on the level of salary.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
As promised, I have reduced my activities.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
For example, my deputy in the spring of business leaders of the travel agencies.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
People want to see me as a Samaritan, saving the republic.
</seg>
<seg id="86">
But I have to live on.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="87">
In which month income were used as an entrepreneur?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">
Some 200000 to 400000, and continue to do so.
</seg>
<seg id="89">
As President, I would set my adventures, however.

<seg id="11">
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way, the statistics: a library.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of great daring bar graphs and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared on the competition hearing in 2003, with five books under the arm and a big smile on his face.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
And while the jury looked intrigued and shrugged his shoulders, stacking the cheeky Maas, the size of its fine jewelry into a pyramid and finished his actionist founded speech with the words: "love town!"
</seg>
<seg id="14">
This is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!

Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million is expensive.

Szabo: " Germany must play a greater role '
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations in Berlin, balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But Berlin abstained.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Why?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, critical of Israel.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to set up a flight ban.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This was finally enforced by NATO.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Yes, that is true.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
That is because it was precisely his foreign policy, away from a policy that were managed by the United States, a German foreign policy.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Germans are between the fronts.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I think they fumble their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A foreign policy, as they have in France or Britain.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
What does a "normal" foreign policy in concrete terms, from a German point of view?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests, which are independent of the United States or European partners.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Germany's economic interests are different from those of the other great powers, to a certain degree, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
These economic interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
That is why we must be careful not to alienate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
It plays a role.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
But in any case, it plays an important role in German thinking.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic collapse in the Libyan issue.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Maybe Germany will even some respect.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
It signaled that it should be considered as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The United States have called for a veto.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
There are differences of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
These differences have always existed because of American domestic politics.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
I believe that the Obama administration has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
But due to the political situation, the government will not publicly, of course.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they seem.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
If the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so upbeat about Netanyahu's policies.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
It is hard to reconcile Germany's close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
So they can be part of a wider line and instead have their own position.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
They are currently using the euro.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
I believe in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Of course, that is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
This has always been a sensitive issue.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
But I think that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player, Germany's desire to play a major role?
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Germany, or the leadership role it still?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
Germany is not accustomed to that is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a greater role.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because each time Germany assumes a greater role in various anti-German feelings.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
It is not just the Germans.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
This is the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics, the EU is currently not filled the vacuum, but who is?
</seg>
<seg id="62">
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them, and they are much less popular, c 'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But what is Armani polo?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Behind this lies a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the origin of companies.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
However, it has long protection, not the actual name donors.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
And even then, it is not clear whether they are right.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing, specialised in protection law violations in the Far East.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The copying a few additional letters, so that they can register their brands.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
So from Gucci Lu-Gucci, Prada, instead leaving Prada-Kny.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
German companies are legally copied in this way, such as the Sportartikel manufacturer Puma.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Patt hole opens a folder with entries of the Trademarks Bureau in Beijing.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protecting the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art names, the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The Chinese are the world champions in the copying and the injured, intellectual property, is well known.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In the big cities, there is a storied department stores, which sell almost exclusively to counterfeiting.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Patt hole, though, there are different: on behalf of its clients, it is the fact that Chinese companies officially by the Trademark Office granted the right to use a term which is already protected elsewhere.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Chinese call the "bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The word is based on "bang Dakuan."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
This refers to women, rich men.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
"It is damaging to business, we must combat it," says Patt hole.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"The brand will disappear, the unique position of image damage is enormous."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The financial losses and litigation costs of the affected industries in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
According to the market research company CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the third largest market for luxury items, and the fastest growing.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But deletions dubious entries in the register trademarks are hard to reach and go to the money.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Up to nine years in the process, with uncertain results.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Patt hole reported cases in which the court's actions, because of the long duration of the name, "complained of the" reality of the market.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he had to pay the Plagiator even money because it violated its trademark in China, says Patt hole.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Famous cases involving graphic elements.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction equipment manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German Betonpumpenbauer plaster masters.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The Chinese must use an emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue and white logo to BMW, the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile in the other direction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits that there was due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Last year, but from the "emergency employment expiration returned to normal life."
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The stock is raw appeal procedures declined by 22 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Nearly 57000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
However, in the office still 81500 appeals to completion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Address that costs a lot
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
This is a record and meant that China for the 10th time in succession, the list of Neuanmeldungen go around the world, with the authority.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
This also applies to the inventory of all the valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In 2011, were 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Simplified, it means that any application costs, on average, 1280 yen or euro.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
To address costs many times, as the case of the German company Freudenberg.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
For more than seven years, the group is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
The Germans were able to ensure that mimic the illegal manufacture of motor vehicle parts was mined.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But the terrorists remain the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
You have failed, because families in Germany could not be protected, said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the business leadership of Freudenberg Chemical available in Munich.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
In the next two instances rather Freudenberg, but the process opponents fighting continues to this day.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
We need to watch
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and commends the professionalism of the courts.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
But he also says: "the process is extremely time-consuming, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
</seg>
<seg id="59">
The internal costs barely quantify the company's archive, even through a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Five years ago, Freudenberg, the other side, in vain, "a high six-digit euro sum" to the settlement.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
"You can see how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to Europe zurückzuschwappen.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Then if adopters too vulnerable brands.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
This business field has long since abandoned the group, but he could turn the registration.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
"We need to watch," says Wentzler.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Both he and the lawyer Patt hole German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, the foreigners "everything is somehow worth protecting, including in China," as Wentzler says.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registration.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
In fact, if Freudenberg in the last act of his trademark filing drama, then you would have to pay the other side of licence fees for their own name, explains Wentzler.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.

Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Could the secret to the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
They place in the middle of a pile of dirty, humid sportswear.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
And leave it there for a week.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
So imagine the nasal stunning smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and this persistent smell in the air, just won't go away.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Rakfisk is fermented with salt sprinkled trout, which, depending on how you stink of fish would like - up to a year in water.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
When the darkness of the country in Norway and the weather gets colder Norwegians flock to a festival in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very impressive speciality.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
"You eat it raw and then washed it with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General," the festival.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"Mansche people more than the Rakfisk" aquavit, says Harvard.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The alcoholic beverage can replace the smell.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
I eat a few bites.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
If it avoids the Rakfisk in near the nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling capabilities and fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In deepest winter, he was taken out after a long fermentation and, no doubt - with the help of alcohol consumed subdued senses.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
A generation ago forced thousands of Norwegians in search of work, to leave their country, mainly in the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who not so long ago was much richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He is one of the more expensive dishes, you can buy here.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But here is all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs impressive 10 euros.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Norway does not often in the press of the world, and most people do not seem to care.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Here you hate it still, Anders Breivik to those racist right extremists last year shot 77 men, women and children.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Instead, it refers only to the "incident on 22 July."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in its peace-loving country.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
It is responsible for today's wealth in Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas in the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
"But oil is not the only reason why it is so good," says Anna, our waitress, the circular trays with seasoned Rakfisk and the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
We are, as it prudent people.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Her English is just as most of the people here.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
We are not very tinhorn, we may not boasting.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - a large proportion of industry revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
As in the years up to the world economic crisis all threw money around, that they had not, Norway closed its wallet.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
"And, of course, Rakfisk eat," she adds with easy laughter.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
I am standing in the snow and on another court, I have had enough of Rakfisk.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
I am a moose-burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
But in the evening, the Stinkefisch on the menu.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The hotel where I stayed, is one of a number of event locations, which can organise a Rakfisk Dinner, where guests for the best - or, perhaps, the sense of smell the most challenging - fish.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
There is a live TV broadcast a show master dressed with fly by plates with Rakfisk.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
"Our priorities are," Harvard.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
Applause and laughs.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the aquavit.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
But it is perhaps the severe haze of the whole fish.

And there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens in the home of my grandfather.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
I was just Americans.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to compete in this language on both ends of an interview.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native, and my American accent, I will not go ahead.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
So I took my American passport and asked me in the queue for Extranjeros.

<seg id="17">
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
On the agenda of all those issues that are expected if the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy is one reason that Mexicans today, as likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc after the model of the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even though he had no details.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with distrust.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Most Americans probably never wasting a single idea that the United States in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under the barrel of a gun, forced to leave them with more than half of its territory.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
But for Mexicans in centuries, not in minutes, not to overlook the memories of this event.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
Therefore, once a U.S. government official even mildest criticism in Mexico - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans, the sovereignty of their neighbour.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
And the children of Monte Zuma's pass on the war path.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
And yet the greatest challenge in Mexico is in fact in the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Want to talk about resentment?
</seg>
<seg id="29">
There are more than enough.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, it does not.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point, a person in our family tree, perhaps one of the parents or grandparents - a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
And in most cases, this person is a profile, dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Not Mexico.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
And while we may have to live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Our identity is blurred, sometimes perhaps, but our loyalty, this is not the case.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
This is clearly the United States.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
This is based on reciprocity.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look at us, because we are not Mexican enough.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
They think that our existence is a symbol of failure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
If not, our families in Mexico had failed, they would not.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
And then we would not now be caught behind the Seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child, immigrated legally in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
While the US State is a citizen, it sees itself as part of the two countries.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
But many Mexican-Americans, I know the feeling of belonging, neither one nor the other country.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but there is not one of them.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
In Mexico, we are Americans.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican command people and parts of the education bourgeoisie to resume ties with the Diaspora.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
We should tell our American colleagues, how great is a visit to the country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
Now.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
This will not happen.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Too many hurt feelings.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
And, given the unequal income distribution, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
I am afraid you alone, amigos.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">
That is fair.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members were just not so long ago.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
Hmmm.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected cornerstone for peace
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
There will never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The latest bloody events seem to have a hope in the bud.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In the midst of the usual recriminations were killed, countless buildings to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis - and, for the first time rockets from Gaza are in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But there are reasons to suspect that the deadly standoff could finally end.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
A war neither lost nor won
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation were inappropriate.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November the this week's battles have strengthened the Hartgesottenen on both sides.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although his group even large losses.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Although a number of Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in a bleak and packed densely populated corners of the planet, it is not managed until now, Hamas to destroy Israel.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Indeed, Hamas wins in the Westjordanland, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
And Hamas leaders might come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Turkey, a revival of regional power, once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken the Hamas party - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power over Syria, where rebels have an increasingly Islamist-style, before Bashar Assad falls could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
And, in particular, the rise of President Muhammad Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the most by far the inhabitants, and most important Arab country on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled the secular despot of Egypt until his fall 2011 for 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders are more dependent on people's views.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove as a player, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
In military terms, Hamas is no longer dangerous.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The Israeli missile defense system, the "iron Dome", and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In diplomatic terms, unwavering, the United States and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
Israel has in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Although the rockets from the Gaza Strip killed 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least because of the security wall has gone into the Westjordanland and thus in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. This to protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared for international law, but always be developed further.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Netanyahu. His Likud Party in the run-up to the elections on January 22, Avigdor Lieberman affiliated with a militant group.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Why this nanny cunning Palestinians and left to their own state?
</seg>
<seg id="33">
If they really had control of the Westjordanland, they would not like their colleagues in Gaza also fire missiles?
</seg>
<seg id="34">
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish you should dare to raise their heads.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Perhaps the hardliners. But the Arab spring could make them.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Even if the Islamists in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the problems in their own country.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its Arab neighbours.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
A war with the local superpower is hardly new Arab governments to help repair its economy.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The pragmatic President Morsi, working with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a cease-fire, could be a sign of promise - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Israelis should think long-term.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt will explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The repression is undermining the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly over the years, its diplomatic toll.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
Both sides need a nudge from outside
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
The answer is that the more sensible people on both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and is represented by this newspaper: two states, Israel's security purposes areas.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The small, for the near future, hope that the cease-fire outside grants more power to enforce this solution.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar to stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by area of exchange and a shared Jerusalem.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Outsiders, Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
Obama also needs to do its bit to push Israel to negotiate.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
He failed the vision of his own peace plan during his first term.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also unwilling to participate in it.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.

<seg id="55">
And a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

It was said, with the laws of the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more readily accessible.

"The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.

Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.

Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.

<seg id="15">
Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd., a small family business, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone to cover the unbearable packaging has grown enormously since the corporations, British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed with their appeal against the law in the Supreme Court in Australia two months ago.

<p>
<seg id="22">
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman noted an increase in reports of experience to brands that have been written by "ordinary people".

In a world constantly electrifying, it is nice to be bored
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
I spent this Thanks Giving unexpectedly five hours in the airport, as our plane because of mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another plane.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts on boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
I will not lie.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But more and more academics and child development expert boredom as something positive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
When it comes to them, it is for us and our children - okay, sometimes bored.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, which promotes creativity.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly on a screen, rigid, the benefits of boredom, not more.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Yes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And no.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
I will come back to this point.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
How many people I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed, with increasing leisure time.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: a Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The house walls of Pompeii adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom in many ways been defined and discussed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
After a long reading of the research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that the experience, "to a satisfactory job boredom, but this does not define".
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Boredom is different from apathy, therefore, that the person is not, but it would be.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The apathy, however, there is no desire to do something.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
The key to the experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption to the attention of process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Boredom can listen to almost like depression.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
However, Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be linked to see bored people, the problem in their area or the world, while depressed people, the problem in itself.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
Sometimes, we believe that it is boring, even if we only have difficulty concentrating.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
In their study, "the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention" - roughly translated: "the inert mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listen to a band, in which a person read a magazine article.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Some groups have heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content of other heard it on low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group not heard these noises.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more boredom than the other two groups, they have had problems to focus on these could find no reason for their difficulties and wrote the boredom.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate Professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
But if you put a monotonous work, "as the search for defective products at a factory conveyor belt, music can help and not get bored."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people physically attentive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
We will all eventually get bored - my delayed flight, a booming loudspeakers, a particularly shun dull, tedious film.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But some people get bored more easily than others.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s, a range of Langeweile vulnerability. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
On the scale are statements such as "many things that I have to do to repeat themselves and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly on the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
But, in general, teenagers are a bunch of pretty slack.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and Gemeinwesens development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and perform the tasks, while 23% said to be bored when they were not in school.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
But only 3% of parents said that they are bored.

Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages have risen about the boredom or dropped.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
He was sure, however, that "the youth is regarded as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have a big impact on their daily lives.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
So, back to my origin question: boredom is healthy?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people take extreme physical risks and all the happiness or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is Professor Vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
"With the boredom, the brain will say that we should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
But the brain does not always know what we should do.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
If it is boring and you use that energy to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
But the television in the short term for happiness, these feelings evaporate but in the long term.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
Anyone who goes to his bored child an iPad, so it can distract from the boredom, but has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas, more self-control.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
I do not believe that we should be celebrating boredom.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
We should also not critical.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Instead, our aim should be to feel at home, away from the ongoing activities and drip irrigation technology.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Professor Eastwood agrees.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
"It sounds like we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
He believes that the people in truth only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61">
"In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is hard to look if the noise is muted."

There are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law in Colorado.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime in court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few chunk of marijuana and a pipe he smoked.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Orozco says he and some friends in a car days in Lamar, near the Kansas border, when they were stopped.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After the police found marijuana in the car, Orozco was for possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien subpoenaed - Kavaliers offenses, each with a fine of US $100 - and received a court date.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
But it is also a?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller, less drug-related crimes from the law than the location.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Hundreds of regulatory obstacles, which revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures have already dropped.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The police authorities are adults over 21 years for possession of small-scale. This is permitted by law, once the new laws in the next few weeks to come into force.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
But state lawyers in more conservative districts Colorados have announced to follow existing marijuana offenses, people are still in court.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
At the same time, several cities, the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains, to prevent a new, state-licensed marijuana stores in the opening in their communities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I didn't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which is located east of Denver.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
And regulatory authorities in the federal state of Washington, scratch their heads at a loss.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
They are waiting for an orientation aid to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In Washington, it is of the opinion that, in any case, most states of Colorado is the regulation of marijuana was legalized the drug only for medical purposes and for self-consumption.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"Colorado has a more regulated market, the state is so good for orientation," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and the end of a grey area in which the state license system does not yet exist, but it is legalized the possession.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
And the unpleasant practice issues that need to be addressed at this time, for example, as the government target of a "reasonable access" to license marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres at schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
" No, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the agglomeration of Seattle, " says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis ", a recently formed research group.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his employees in an e-mail, he said, the state attorney would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years, and that the police would "immediately" no prosecutions for such offences.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to urban standards to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
In Weld County in northern Colorado represents District State attorney Ken Buck a stricter view.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
After the vote, he stated that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Currently must answer 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, though many have been charged for other offenses.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations, which point to the time of the offence to crime," saying in a statement.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
The reactions are in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults no longer for the possession of small amounts of it.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
State district attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but not all outstanding possession proceedings.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
"I don't think I wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
While 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and justice system.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
And the contradictory reactions throughout the country promoted a profound dilemma among local officials, the big green experiment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
In state district attorneys a cultural barrier, " said Sean McAllister, a law attorney in Denver, the defendants standing trial for marijuana crimes and acts locally as spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
"They have spent a large part of their lives to prosecute people that they can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as a national pattern of cases for the legalization of drugs.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sales, they also are waiting nervously on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Advocates of legalization movement hope will give the Ministry of Justice.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Despite several great deal of attention when arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government, the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that investigators probably will not close any doors to confiscate small quantities of drugs, but it will probably be reluctant to condone under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Wait several cities in Colorado, not the federal authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Even before the polling day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although this could open in a year.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Last week decided to Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
"We do not want to get into a position in which we license and then somebody at the federal level is a big issue," Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Our community has voted against this law change.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
We have done this for the community, not for what was decided by the state.

There are still many questions unanswered.

Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am a Tory
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Not only university students today attacked for her views
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="3">
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Both my father and my elder brother had visited the university, which I thought was once the largest knowledge stamp in the world - for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester College in the late 1980s, I had intended to study history - I had packed my suitcase and the first scandal of my life.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
My father broke down in tears.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
My friends were confused.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I would have had a problem with fellow students in the adjacent room sex.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The author of A N Wilson impish explained, I would have to leave the university because I was forced to drink from a damaged cups.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
But the truth was less amusing.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
I ran away.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I was bullied for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment: my late father now Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser of Margaret Thatcher and supporter of the Conservative Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Why do I mention this now?
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Now, according to latest reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week, the same Equal Treatment Directive, the protection of gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College, they are often actively isolated because of their political views, "personally attacked and declared undesirable."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
They call for a place in the equal rights committee of college, to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Their situation worsened by a recent documentary that radiates political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It was among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student union of the University of Oxford, who drove a Rolls-Royce and flaunts silver suit and silver occupied walking stick.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Other universities, conservative students say they are considered as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative Students Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: " there is a growing trend of links to universities.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, believes such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect of the conservative student association of Oxford says she watched with JCR, members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of its members," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
I was such a minority in my first weeks in Oxford.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old was reached in September 1986.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Last year, the university had voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education to any title.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
In the first days of the first semester-week to get to know the new students and tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
I made the experience that the tutors mocking of Tory students not only tolerated, but even with joy took part.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Political issues such as the miners ' strike, privatisation and the rejection of the Government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa had found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
In the first of these events I French texts into English from the 18th century. What should I was not taken.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
"Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "translate" the first paragraph.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
I stumbled.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and rather be horrendous.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
"Refuse Thatcher loyalists to learn French, or are you just stupid?" He asked me.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The other students giggled.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Wall tears in my eyes.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"I suggest that you take a couple of French hours in your free time, so if you are not too preoccupied with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
I returned with hanging heads in my room.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
That evening, I sat alone in the college at the dinner when someone had typed lightly on the shoulder.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I know who you are," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Unfortunately, it is the way it is.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Anyone who is suspected to be a Tory.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father, Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Most of the Tory first semester, to be a supporter of the Labour Party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
In a local pub I tried later to distract me.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
I insisted that I was not entirely with Mrs. Thatcher.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
A university entrants in philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, as a conservative force had attended Eton College, said to me: "you are the daughter of a fascist pig".
</seg>
<seg id="55">
You are dirty.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Other students shared his opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
I was perverted and dirty.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
"How Tories have sex?" One asked me.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
The beating each other?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">
I felt so how homosexuals have felt the more liberal legislation in the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
I think it would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
</seg>
<seg id="62">
I would be able to meet only after nightfall?
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
</seg>
<seg id="64">
The three years before me, extended song to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
The only tutor, who was openly as a Tory, Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
It was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy speeches and written for them.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
He was rarely there.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and turned him down for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
"You will not be happy," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">
I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
My father told me that I hated, Oxford, and why I did it.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
He seemed incredulous.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
During his time in the forties of all political views were accepted.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
It is something she would never do in my city of dreaming tower.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
Even my communist friends presented impeccable manners.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
Tarnished his moist eyes.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
Give a chance.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
I am sure you only teasing.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
It would break my heart if you were walking.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had bowed to pressure to renounce his beliefs.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
During a Tutoriums the following week, with a further serious history tutor had claimed I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
Although I secretly ashamed zerging, I admitted that my parents to undergo "brainwashing" and called them "old sucker."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86">
The relief lasted only briefly.
</seg>
<seg id="87">
It was my father, who was the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
</seg>
<seg id="88">
At that time, he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">
My door was locked.
</seg>
<seg id="90">
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors.
</seg>
<seg id="91">
As they went, I was packing a suitcase and took the first train to London.
</seg>
<seg id="92">
I never returned.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93">
You can call me a whiny wimp.
</seg>
<seg id="94">
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
</seg>
<seg id="95">
And even more tragic is that it was an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory, but until now hidden behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

" Valentino elegance of the celebrity '

<p>
<seg id="2">
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of couture," which opened this week in London, speaks with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of Italian fashion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is hosting an exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
This has been recognised by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - master of couture," a magnificent retrospective, for which more than 130 dresses of haute couture, which were created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"I love this palace," he says, with its distinctive Italian accent.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist of "il signore" Garavani but is not without its exclusive clientele could be written.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Valentino had always been a fascination for the sticky and distant world of the aristocracy.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In the first room of this exhibition, which will continue until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the choicest aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from humble fashion-maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international Jetsets.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
To be in love with the nobility, need not be a disadvantage.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"At least they are not tilting at your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Fiona, Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two in the Alps, and were good friends.

<seg id="13">
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant host.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"We were happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the Exfrau "Heini" Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the celebrity.

He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.

<seg id="27">
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long catwalk, which proposes a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model, and along the catwalk to admire a beautiful "audience," the masterpieces of Valentino, as the dress, Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, chose the costumes, Monica Vitti in "la Notte", or a coat made of wool and leather, the Empress Farah Diba was one example.

Key questions
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"The Internet as a medium for the search for information, with the release of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in education at Yale University and author of the novel "digital natives and Immigrants" these words to explain the phenomenon.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The Digital Natives are children and young people who grew up with this technology.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"We are the digital immigrants are to teach them when we learn," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we want them to have a defined criteria about what should be made public or, and this is not enough in an age where the maturity."
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"They should also be fussy when it is most important to be popular to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions they thought.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
"To tell you, they should not do not work," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
Porras is called after some possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Or would you, if you publish a photo of you, that you have posted by a friend?
</seg>
<seg id="51">
You know what the others about you?
</seg>
<seg id="52">
You have other people asked for permission, if you have pictures of celebrations labelled?
</seg>
<seg id="53">
And another question: all need to know what you are doing at any moment?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online as they do offline.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
They are the same rules.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
"Someone who is outside of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
Monitoring
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is vital that the parents of the directives of social networks to read carefully.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
If you understand all of them have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"Example, age, or what you can publish and share," he explains.

<seg id="2">
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of a common state citizenship is a goal, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Correa, who took part in the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans, "in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing" and "today is a country."

In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American state citizenship, the members countries of the Unasur.

"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as it is in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The President of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the Agreement of San Jose on human rights.
</seg>

"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said as a reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Correa asserted that he does not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He added that it was time to "reasonable suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and procedures."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which requires him to submit it to an interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence on his State territory, while the Swedish law allows this via a video conference on the Ecuadorian Embassy in London could be executed. "

<seg id="12">
Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental condition of Assange.

"Since it is in our message, I have not spoken to him, the ambassador, however, has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not serious," said the head of Ecuador's state.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
There is a danger, though, that he was mindful of physical and mental harm because he was caught in a tight space and carried no physical exercises outdoors.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since the month of June, the granting of an open letter, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe. It underscored that it was in talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.

We do not act with human rights, we do not apply in this case, however, there have been ongoing discussions.

"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedures at various European institutions," he said.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
And "if Britain morning granted the licence, in my opinion, this is done."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogated over Skype, as allowed under Swedish law, and in other cases, the problem is.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity, the bad faith and deceit, the free expression of opinion."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"The greatest enemies of press freedom is not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists seeking profits and blackmail," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
In this sense, he congratulated himself for Ecuador, no more of those journalists, "and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spit bourgeois countries", and that he had "a re-election will deepen the revolution to continue on the path in the right direction."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the body must remain "firm and no opportunism and no legal trick-State must take place," because it "destroys the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."

He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is true for Latin America, call for international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."

Correa promised that if he could lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.

Cause of death due to AIDS, is today a late detection
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, the doctor tried without visible success "to weaken."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He hid it from his family.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He decided to take care of his own illness and began to inform and with such dedication that he celebrated his 43 birthday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He is Zweifels without one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several clashes in 1994.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to conceive of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
At that time it avoided even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to adopt, "because it led to a dead end."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
At the time AIDS was synonymous with death.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
But still many people in the clinic, who know nothing about their illness and the virus has already caused damage and has exhausted her immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, after the first reported cases, "the big success has come to mean that the survival of patients, the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the life quality of the degree of impairment of the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that those with more chances, which are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Simply put, the above mean, who at the age of 25, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in that sense, "easily 75 years of age can be as long as it is under control," said the expert.

<seg id="15">
In order to correct this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years.

<seg id="16">
Even if the mortality rate decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico has reduced the number of people dying of AIDS, 6678 cases in 2007 to 4862 in 2011 (year report ONUSIDA)), it is true that since the release of the 60 percent of AIDS patients have died in the national database.

<p>
<seg id="18">
- Why so people are still dying?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of the drugs, the problem is that the people in an advanced state of affairs because they do not know of their infection status in very late stages of the disease.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
He makes a compelling statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, and all the people, where this is massive detector tests must be offered."

Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.

Héctor " Hetin " Reyes: " basketball was my life '
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The globetrotter of Basketballs, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, who was sporting a basket for more than 60 years and has traveled the world as a whole.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of intellectual history of Basketballs country Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Before he was bound to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, was Rexes 6 years for part of this sport, be it as a lower-tier players, players of the first National League, an agent and manager in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
"My whole life I have had many hats in basketball, even more at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, main business leaders of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Basketball was my life."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Reyes not with this statement.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career, almost all of them.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Bayamón in heart
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The emotional recollections are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros of the mid-1950s as a player in 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or business leader of the club.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
" These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967 as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or trainer.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
There were many rewarding years, including successive five championships from 1971 to 1975.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy with BSN.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
From then, " Cuco " Ortiz, who was a very good manager, " said Reyes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
I know that I am Gene Bartow, who was here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: " I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
You want it? "
</seg>
<seg id="17">
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Bartow, recommended that the Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gauss, creep, and was one of our best shooter.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
I remember he said that if Mincy a championship for Bayamon, Gauss further.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gauss was granted to him, but even from a distance, because he was already at the top of the Union in 1988.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
At that time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Then came the World Cup in 1990, in the fourth documented what bronze should have been, if not the Canadian referee would have been a repeat of the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
This group was the 1990 World Cup, the best national team you have ever seen?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
It is one of the best, as well as those that won against the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
But my favorite is the crew of the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and the team of the United States offered a fight as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
When the team were not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who in 1990 because of a knee injury.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities, not the best, but we won a gold medal and was a great pleasure, the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won against all forecast the gold medal.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
This was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
And this without taking account of his career in different leagues, in which he has played.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
This is a difficult question.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The boy, I like the work of Leo Arill.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
What remains to be done to you?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The guys in Ponce, for example, playing in only their territory and only in the national Play offs on teams from other corners of the island.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Today, the children of many unnecessary trips and games.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
At least I can see the result of the required training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
I am proud of that.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
What do you do today?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
I like to listen to music, videos, music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

Larry Hagman is dead
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." In the TV series "Dallas," where he played a ruthless, shrewd and manipulative business man.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Larry Hagman, whose role as the Ölmagnat J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He was 81 years old.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a press release of the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
"Larry was back in his birth city of Dallas, where he played the iconic role he loved most," said the family.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Erntedankfestes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series in Hagman when he died in hospital in Dallas, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
He made all the joy that knew him.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him greatly.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"He was a unique person and lived life to the fullest," said Gray, in a statement.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In 1995, a malignant tumor in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

In the years before "Dallas," Hagman on television as a nice guy with the sitcom in 1965-1970 "charming Jeannie" of the NBC television channel.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
There, he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden, who live in his own home.

<seg id="17">
To his movies were rated by the criticism of the roles in "the Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "primary Colors."
</seg>
</p>
<p>

But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting despicable J.R., made Hagman a superstar.

The dramatic series of the television network CBS about the Ewing clan and other figures in the surrounding area was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.

The slogan "who scored on J.R.?", the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure killed by Hagmann almost led to an international speculation and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Thus the series reached an audience record in that period.

</seg>
<seg id="24">
Carter had made and threatened to portray them as prostitutes, if they are not relying upon the city, but also had other reasons to want to see him dead.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, greedy man with a charismatic smile: a devious business man and unfaithful husband sought to familiarise its alcohol sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
"I know what to put on the tombstone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
It should read "here lies the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
This is the only business that he has not won.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
Victoria Principal, Mitdarstellerin of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as an "enormous personality in and outside of the screen."
</seg>
