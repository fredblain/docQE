<seg id="47"> This will Marek said to the server iHNed.cz this week be decisive for it how the finance sector and the government divide the losses up between each other ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Whether the plan or you adopt at the beginning of next week, isn't decisive to Mareks opinion now. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "It is much more important that the convention representatives reach an agreement to support the plan and that they approve it as fast as possible. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The psychological meaning of the agreement that it comes to a farewell is the most important ", at this moment Marek emphasized. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Duel on Messers blade: MP3 player against mobile telephones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We advise you in your choice </seg>
<seg id="3"> While almost every mobile telephone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a telephone call yet. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It therefore looks so of course that it is better to buy only a telephone for itself. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Despite everything there are sufficient reasons for it why one should get himself an independent player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The choice completely depends the future owner on the way of the use and the claims off. </seg>
<seg id="7"> One for certain buys a terrific expensive record player for himself hardly for at home to listen on this to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Once, such musical novelties don't appear on LPs and there isn't any objective reason for it from the qualitative view either. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you have, however, LPs with kind of skirt, jazz or blues in the shelf, you probably dream at least of a such. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So this is expressed in simplified terms also with the music on journeys that is with compressed music, music in the MP3 format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There are price and quality categories also. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Perhaps for the one it isn't acceptable to spend crowns on a player eight thousand, a pink Floyd fan will hardly well as well cope with headphones for twenty crowns of the market, however. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes between which gives for every sufficient room. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The choice is diversified broadly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The life time of the batteries is also decisive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Much more than only music can play Music player but they don't even create by way of a hint what mobile telephones can do some good. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern device has to be used as universally as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Besides the primary functions, making a telephone call and sending an SMS a worse camera it can represent music and videos, both takes, it has a better and can navigate perhaps also. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And, if one still includes the smart phon and communicators, one has almost a little computer in the bag. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a small miracle because no refrigerator can grill and no television set take a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of the mobile telephones also brings about disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Be of use for the more functions on your mobile telephone, the more frequently will you have to reload it, however. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And is playing music one of the greatest energy eaters. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only few mobile telephones can play music longer than zehn-zw√∂lf hours, it is much fewer mostly. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this regard Music player is (special the simple) considerably efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Therefore you should expect at the cheap mobile telephones with that that they cannot play longer than a couple of hours music. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If, from time to time, you then still make a telephone call, you prefer to buy another battery charger at safety reasons for yourself for the office -- this also applies to a more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Wanting to not you have this problem at MP3-Playern, the less good ones also bear uninterrupted business with a loading time for at least 9 hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> There is another problem when one wants to cover the music up on the mobile telephone. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, only a low part of the equipment has a USB degree, in addition, everybody doesn't have for himself attached mobile telephone to a PC without special software directly. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course one can cover the music up directly on a storage medium, becomes only few card film readers without diminution ready with the tiny memory cards which are used into mobile telephones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> You don't need special software at Playern except for exceptions (iPod). </seg>
<seg id="33"> You need to feed the device only over USB port with music from your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile telephones and player lay out a music library, organized according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or for example the assessment by users themselves. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some equipment shows only the tree structure of the address list both iriver (Samsung Sony Cowon intelligent telephones with operating system), similarly like the Windows Explorer, some be able to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Are player more easily to use, mobile telephones can do more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> You should particularly ask the choice of a concrete device about the life time of the accumulator, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also the using comfort. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Music is primarily scenery for you and you listen to it every day in the streetcar only briefly, for example, an arbitrary mobile telephone which plays MP3 files then suffices. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What almost every mobile telephone can really already do. </seg>
<seg id="40"> You don't have to check also particularly, which music formats a mobile telephone or a player can process. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Everyone creates MP3 and most music which you get will just be in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format is part of the most common and in addition, most equipment also can play music in the WMA format. </seg>
<seg id="43"> AAC (a format which Apple and its iPods use) is less usual. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better mobile telephones also make the purchase of music online possible. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One only needs to call the appropriate sides of a provider (or another supplier) over a mobile Internet and one already can purchase a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service can already actually be an apt argument for it why one should get himself a music mobile telephone. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately, the supply of the providers is badly and limitedly only on fast radio hits mostly. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices aren't the lowest ones either. </seg>
<seg id="49"> One generally assumes, that (however, exactly this manner of the sale of music be about GSM, Internet wireless) it the music industry will master in future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Most carry the mobile telephone at themselves. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you feel like sounding a little, you reach in the coat pocket for the mobile telephone while the player forgotten is lying at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> It depends, however, on whether you always carry headphone or at least a wireless free phone facility at themselves, too. </seg>
<seg id="53"> You can go back to the integrated loudspeaker which almost every mobile telephone has if not but MP3 player only the few. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The probably biggest advantage of the music mobile telephones will lie in the price for many. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three and four thousand crowns you already get a quite decent walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The greatest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are there. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and technically most mature telephones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> In turn the player is the light operation the advantage. </seg>
<seg id="60"> (See) choice the simple and not absolutely cheap -- each player really can use. </seg>
<seg id="61"> One, with the operation with a the in the past normal cassette recorder or for example the record player minimum is obvious to functions, the similarity. </seg>
<seg id="62"> No collision threatens in form of a mistakenly hired mobile Internet and a then horrendous invoice for data transmissions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> One should reach for which device now </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> The cheapest mobile telephones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also have a Slot for interchangeable storage media (type m2, microSD and √§), as a rule. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if you buy a corresponding card later, two thousand crowns suffice. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But respect. </seg>
<seg id="67"> As a rule, only cards are supported with a maximum capacity of 2 GB at the base models. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive ones also can read 8 GB memory cards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you want to have a mobile telephone already and buy another cheap MP3 player for themselves, then you reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> You then don't have to put crowns on the table depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) any more than 1100. </seg>
<seg id="71"> If you belong to the more demanding listeners, you take mobile telephones, walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung), specialized prefer. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This equipment has independent using buttons for MP3 and the using comfort approaches that one of a single MP3 player so. </seg>
<seg id="73"> MP3 player is the furthest here Sony Ericsson, his mobile telephones have the same user interface as these sold one by one from the series walkman. </seg>
<seg id="74"> Accumulator life time (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) reaches for the same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and one do you MP3 player of the manufacturers mentioned above. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual supplier comes to Czechia already this year. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps </seg>
<seg id="3"> The cellular market in Czechia is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer all services practically, like them are offered for partners also of hers in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Something is nevertheless missing here, a virtual supplier who forces the classic ones to lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps this will let wait for himself no longer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Czech mobile telephone suppliers work to the most expensive ones in Europe at all, we already have about it often reported on Mobil.cz that. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This also confirmed the telecommunications authority by the way T√ö which drew one's attention that the price for a SMS is higher than in the rest of the European Union here?. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of the roaming charges it so probably comes to a paradoxical situation -- for some customers of the Czech mobile telephone suppliers, from abroad, SMS will be cheaper than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How does it come that the prices are so high in the comparison with Europe in Czechia? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, the competition which a declaration of war makes actual is absent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, there are three mobile phone networks and a Penetration of far more than 100% in Czechia anyway. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On the other hand, the mobile telephone suppliers like to complain about it, that there is much competition on the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The chairman of the advice of the Czech telecommunications authority often agrees (?)?, at, T√ö with it Pavel Dvo √°k, too, which had that there is no place for another supplier in Czechia often said in the past. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It makes probable that a classic supplier has no longer particularly many chances with a net of his own (he probably would by the way also hardly find frequencies.) </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, there still is a possibility, a virtual supplier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Definitely the admission of virtual suppliers on the cellular market brought about a clear price reduction with himself to which the classic mobile telephone suppliers then had to react, too. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There still were similar voices like in Czechia on the market in Great Britain with the admission of such companies like Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, it have turned out that there is place for such suppliers and that this can be really successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> One by the way doesn't need for a long time to look for examples. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We have reported over the start of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland in February this. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In only half a year this supplier managed to win more than 100 one thousand customers and to climb to the five largest supplier of the country so. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind Mobilking the finance group of Penta stands, among other things this one U: phons has in Czechia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual suppliers consists that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To be able to work effectively, virtual suppliers need namely much less customers as a classic supplier. </seg>
<seg id="25"> You don't need relatively high costs for the making, the operation and the conversation of a mobile net namely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The virtual suppliers usually make a name for themselves as Low-Cost companies in the world out so, they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, what is often accompanied by a less extensive service offering, though. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> So Tesco mobile offers SMS as its competitors at least around the half more cheaply in Great Britain, for example. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As the example of Mobilking points, however, in Poland, it also can be a quite good gambit not to put a stereotyped target group on one. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This supplier consults namely specifically men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Real guys choose Mobilking the supplier whom so David Seibert, the CEO of the mobile Entertainment company, the operator company of this virtual supplier, they like and whom they can trust " -- ". </seg>
<seg id="31"> Hard to say whether foot could take hold of a similar concept like in Poland also in Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The press agent of Vodafone Miroslav also doubts it?epick √Ω: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment most virtual suppliers are based on. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, he is relatively made replete from the view of the service offering." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The mobile telephone suppliers mean in Czechia bound to lose </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> However, it is almost sure that will be this not Mobilking, if a virtual mobile telephone supplier conquers Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We talk about an expansion of this successful project but the negotiations don't look hopeful particularly in Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It will rather come to a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region ", kov√°, press agent of the finance group of Penta, says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studni so?. </seg>
<seg id="38"> She indirectly confirmed so that the present mobile telephone suppliers are inclined in Czechia towards this thought not particularly. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they try to do everything for this that no potential competitor arises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Your interest in a start of a virtual mobile telephone supplier shows the group of GTS Novera already for quite a long time which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef√≥nica O2 in the area of company customers. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have a great interest not to offer our customers only fixed network, but also mobile telephone telecommunications services. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the earlier, the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> We have negotiated about this possibility repeated with all Czech mobile telephone suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="44"> We could already reach negotiation progress ", so the press agent of the group of Pavel Kaidl with some of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps better times are coming now. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Information not goes out that the first virtual supplier has to be expected perhaps by the end of the year from official. </seg>
<seg id="47"> This is surrounded by an invincible wall of the silence till now, however. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "At this moment, we don't assume, that place consists for a full virtual supplier in Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market shows great Spezifika compared with other markets. </seg>
<seg id="50"> E has appealed no subject to us ", in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr thinks?with a complex and serious project in this area till now yet? from the press department of Telef√≥nica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Also further suppliers point to the Spezifik of the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press agent of T mobile Martina Kemrov√° adds in rare agreement with the explanation of O2: "We haven't found any viable and on both sides advantageous project till now on which one could further build." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And she adds: "Hardly a virtual supplier will appear in the net of T mobile by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At this moment we already should a concrete offer be available have to be able to think so quickly." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone rather turns its attention towards the fulfillment of the requirements of the 3 of one's own g license. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Epick √Ω thinks Miroslav about it?: "We are straight negotiations with potential virtual suppliers particularly in the area of dividing costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> We regard exactly this as the best one from the view of the customers. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is the search for a partner to the construction of a split net for a fast mobile Internet." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities with the suppliers Hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The procedure of the mobile telephone suppliers is easy to understand, another supplier would be called more competition, this also would lead this to a fall in the profits at dropping prices and through. </seg>
<seg id="61"> So why should one make the market entry easier for such a competitor? </seg>
<seg id="62"> The long proves also to that the suppliers can draw at a rope if it is about something and Her around the emergence of U: phon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> T√ö went out in the direction of?, as at the moment the probably heaviest pressure U: phon came onto the market from the society T mobile. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The publicly accessible information also covers this T√ö web pages of the?. </seg>
<seg id="65"> U: phon as an argument why one shouldn't allow a virtual supplier is just suitable now, however. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrov√° noticed to this: "The competition environment of the cellular market was recently still strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile telephone supplier, in addition. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Under consideration of the character of the cellular market in the Czech Republic a new protagonist is obvious that his would on the market make services high demands alone and primarily." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> In view of this Herangehensweise of the mobile telephone suppliers the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulation authorities astonishes, though. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It this one isn't only it the attitude?T√ö which unfortunately doesn't have the competence in Czech as opposed to Great Britain and further highly developed states to intrude on the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This exclusively has the office to the protection of the economic competition (√öOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> However, this bought his quite typical attitude at these complete difficulties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "The market entry of a virtual mobile telephone supplier then would be possible after it has come to a completion of a contract between a mobile telephone supplier and a virtual supplier about the rental of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> No such contract was concluded till now because the supply of potential interested parties probably wasn't interesting sufficiently for the classic suppliers ", about in his answer to our enquiry Kristi√°n Chalupa of the department outer relations of the √öOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Of representatives of the suppliers such a wording wouldn't surprise. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Of an authority which shall represent the consumer interests and among other things pay attention to it that nobody abuses his position on the market this is more than dubious. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Particularly if Kristi√°n Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual suppliers work quite normally it has to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction at mobile telephone services." </seg>
<seg id="77"> The pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction probably are not part of the interests of the √öOHS, however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> The harmony of the three mobile telephone suppliers almost already stirring which arises from their reactions really is shocking at this case. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question whether it really only is chance is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="80"> The absolutely identical price of gasoline for certain is just like only chance and the result of a hard competition for the gas stations. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "The authority has discovered no symptoms in this thing which indicate a behavior aimed at the competition and it therefore doesn't have any reason to intervene in the matter in any way either. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the suppliers has a dominant position in the market, he therefore doesn't have the corresponding increased responsibility for his behavior on the market either. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The regulation authority probably also lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the cellular market for virtual suppliers for telecommunications ", Chalupa led in its explanation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> One is the interpretation of the dominating position on the market from many controversial points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets T√ö, worked out of the?, one single market is after the telecommunications from the view of the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="86"> None of the Czech mobile telephone suppliers then holds a dominating position on such a market of course. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Some on the right experts offer another position, however -- the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile telephone supplier has the monopoly for his net logically. </seg>
<seg id="89"> This one means that he takes a dominating position necessarily in a certain segment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if one, however, doesn't go along with this argumentation, it should be at least a warning for the √öOHS that three mobile telephone suppliers proceed conspicuously similarly. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Troubles of a number of interested parties prove (including the mentioned society GTS Novera) that they push during negotiations with all suppliers on very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> T√ö is then a quite usual trick with which the √öOHS of the whole matter dissociates itself the Abw√§lzung of the responsibility on this one in the telecommunications services?. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This had already to be watched in some similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately, it isn't excellently, into the amendment of the telecommunications law recently adopted the?the expansion of the competences to succeed on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunications with T√ö although a number of experts had itself promised an improvement in the situation of this. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives of the √öOHS must know this only too well but probably they have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It already works if nobody looks </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Unnoticed remains once the functioning of any pseudovirtueller suppliers of whom there is several in the Czech mobile phone networks at once. </seg>
<seg id="98"> It is companies which spend price lists of their own on mobile telecommunications services which, however, only partly are public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> It usually is namely companies which proceed in the area of multi-level marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Mobile telephone services of one's own offer Starlife and others to Amway, Bohemia Telecom, for example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price lists of these companies usually reach only to chosen. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the thing consists that the company appears as a classic corporate customer opposite the operator who orders one large amount of SIM cards. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As an important customer he then receives special quotations (and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem consists in the fact that the business conditions of all Czech mobile telephone suppliers forbid a resale taken similarly. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "There should be cases, which you describe, then it can be an injury of the contractual conditions, which deal we then will, what can lead to a completion of the cooperation with the appropriate society", answered Martina Kemrov√° on our question on this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> It is quite improbable that something like that doesn't get round with the persons responsible of the mobile telephone suppliers, though. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Particularly in the fall of the three mentioned companies it can be thousands customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator opposes, however, such a procedure. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Profits to be not neglected namely go from the activity of these companies to them, they aren't impaired by the real official marketing as opposed to the actual virtual suppliers simultaneously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> Miroslav draws one's attention to possible problems?epick √Ω attentive: "The law makes such kinds of speculation possible, despite everything the services of these companies are only used by a very little percentage of the customers. </seg>
<seg id="111"> Furthermore these must accept that the SIM card doesn't run in telephone of their on name of their, so they cannot have it fully like the normal customers of the mobile telephone suppliers." </seg>
<seg id="112"> Spare this alone but this one must?at least seem strange to T√ö. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> In addition, further question opens up for the √öOHS. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Do the mobile telephone suppliers lock the eyes before such a procedure, why do they balk at a virtual supplier? </seg>
<seg id="115"> Himself it is added that the √öOHS for the uncovering of such activities has quite strong competences and it must, if it doesn't want, the supplier, it wouldn't know nothing with the explanation and these would its business conditions forbid, be content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When Czechia isn't the most expensive any more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> How was emphasized already repeatedly in the text, did the market entry of virtual suppliers bring a clear price recession about at the different services? </seg>
<seg id="118"> The classic suppliers have practically tried in all countries where virtual suppliers have arisen to prevent the emergence practically more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The arguments used by them were practically identically -- a too more smally or too very more saturatedly market, problems at the quality of the services etc.. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> However, the regulation organs which tried to keep the interests of the mobile suppliers but those of their customers not at all stepped in in the highly developed countries just at these moments. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Be by formal measures or not formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator arose and further followed this. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, the Czech regulation organs throw the whole case to themselves like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Starting out from our experiences we cannot rid ourselves of the impression that uncertainty is more than favorable in these cases in the competences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> But we don't throw the shotgun into the grain. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Perhaps soon, if the background information is correct and a virtual supplier appears soon, the Czech cellular market will get again into movement. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier allows the origin of a virtual mobile telephone supplier, the √öOHS won't remain idle if it is all about decline further interested parties (discriminate against). </seg>
<seg id="127"> And then the Czeches will not make a telephone call finally any more expensively than the rest of Europe. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The Sudeten demanded a referendum of the USA </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Sudeten Germans had requested the affiliation of the B√∂hmerwaldes to the United States in 1945. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This results from a letter which is stored in the collections of the south Bohemian scientific library. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> If we cannot be component of Germany or Austria, then we would like to live under the patronage of the United States of America at least. </seg>
<seg id="5"> With such a wish some groups of Sudeten Germans shall have addressed the U.S. president in 1945. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Among other things this results from a letter which has remained unchanged in a private archive and which is kept in the collections of the south Bohemian scientific library today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Germans of Krumau ask the American president, he in the letter the return of the "Sudetengaus" shall not permit -- this one was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement -- to Czechoslovakia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It is said in a letter which is signed with the words "people who are concerned about the destiny of the Sudeten" "we have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units don't enter a German territory as oppressor and enemies but as a liberator". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests in knowledge of the Czech national character that they would expect brutality, inconsiderateness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery to the Sudeten Germans, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take on the protection about the B√∂hmerwald for today and open eternally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> We "cannot" think that you award this area to one without consideration for the view of a quarter million inhabitants for a state foreign to us which suppresses and has tried to remove and nothing at all contributed to the victory of the Allies purely minorities, has to be read in the letter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The reason for it why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Czech oppressors". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> If the U.S. president entertains doubt about the fundamental attitude of the B√∂hmerwalddeutschen, it is sufficient if he would initiate a referendum about this in the B√∂hmerwaldgau whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or to live under the protection of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of the after-war history, it draws, however, a good picture in opinion of some contemporary witnesses with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans then. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Even if the Bohemian Germans had to suspect at least that one would negotiate about their deportation from the republic, only some of them admitted such a possibility to themselves at all. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some waited that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Again others thought they simply could stay in Czechoslovakia. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa who is from Budweis also confirms this one. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He was appointed Budweiser German in the war in the navy at the Baltic Sea. </seg>
<seg id="19"> When he came into a British captivity at the end of the war and one took him to a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of further Bohemian Germans came to him, he shall teach them Czech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> You thought if they came home " so Chalupa would get them the Czech to fits come ". </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nobody of the German prisoners of war which had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war calculated in his opinion that one would him expel decrees from the republic?on the basis of the Bene. </seg>

<seg id="7"> However, a bus can have an accident or slow down sharply also at the moment at which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> A role also plays, whether the bus after the registration document also is equipped with standing rooms. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If this isn't provided by the bus, the travelers must sit. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The far coaches of student Agency don't have any standing rooms; .cz confirmed what the director of the company, Radim Jan?ura, opposite Aktu√°ln?. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "We have discussed this with the department and this hasn't agreed to the movement of travelers first. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Later has one taken this back, and we have reached an agreement, after what may the travelers go during the journey on the toilet if they have their seat ", it informed about its point of view. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The law doesn't know any steward </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward -- no legal provision describes this role. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There isn't any legal provision either which forbids the carrier to render services, though. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The law about the traffic knows only the concept vehicle companion; it, however, doesn't define the rights and duties the spokesman of the department adds Hanzelka obviously ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The director of the department street vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn √Ω, however, thinks that the law covers these difficulties afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "It depends on whether the bus also has standing rooms in the product admittance. </seg>
<seg id="19"> All this then is ", he emphasizes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Busses subdivide themselves into town busses where there are standing rooms and the maximum speed is limited, short-distance traffic busses, with standing rooms and permissible a higher speed and far coaches without standing rooms with the highest permitted speed and seats which are equipped with seat belts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Like in the airplane says the expert </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> √çn doesn't see any basic problem in the movement of stewards the BESIP expert for roadworthiness Jaroslav Ho?on board of a bus. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "At a liquid way of driving many dangers don't threaten the situation is comparable with the service on board of an airplane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Himself isn't sure when turbulences come and the stewardess can also here push the head." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "If a bus brakes, however, sharply, then the laws are for physics of course, too. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Just like in the town bus or in a streetcar. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The carrier must clear the safety of the stewards ", he says and thinks by internal regulations also that these difficulties aren't solved completely from the view of the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Ura is ready to paint the services Jan? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Student Agency offers services of stewards as the only bus company. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The company employs about two hundred persons in this function. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The director doesn't consider her profession risk prone after the accident either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> "I but the impression gets that the profession of the steward is risk prone as soon as I will paint it. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Coffee and newspapers can get the travelers at boarding. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This also would lower the costs ", he thinks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As interest in the safety the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin gives reasons for being absent of stewards in his busses. However, his society operates only a fraction of lines in the comparison with student Agency. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We don't have any stewardesses, we already fight against it from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="37"> This ends with any fatal accident ", sooner or later it intended not quite one spoken year for T √Ω den.cz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> This was an unbelievable tragedy </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> At the accident of a regular bus to Naples a young stewardess had had an accident from the region Pilsen which had worked for the society for two years. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The Slovenian truck was probably bent by the stand stripe without flashing and had blocked the bus the journey. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The driver of the bus tried to make way by a sharp maneuver collided, however, with the right front with the truck. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Jan denies that the two places have been sold for the stewards?ura. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "These places cannot be reserved at long-distance connections, they are blocked." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Company wants to sue truck drivers. </seg>
<seg id="45"> With a compensation for the family of the young woman the agency won't wait for the judgement, it, however, expects a financial compensation also on the part of the guilty person. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> An amendment of the law? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Not in view </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> A more exact regulation of the movement of stewards on board of a bus could bring about a legal regulation a thirty-headed expert team of the Ministry of Transport works on already over a year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> "This hasn't reached any concrete end yet, though. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Busses don't stand the agenda, rather the Punktesystem, the maximum speed on the freeway and the use of mobile telephones in case of the journey √≠n absolutely on ", so expert Ho?either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> The Ministry of Transport "doesn't" regard the activity of the stewards as something which could endanger the safety of the travelers fundamentally how control of the safety of the busses is, so Hanzelka, in the competence of the police and the maintenance of industrial health and safety standards authorities. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hopes of D√ºsseldorf rest on Frankfurt </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Doesn't there be a lack of great words in the letter of the WestLB executive board to the employees of the house. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is said in the letter become known on Monday "the central capital market house of the savings bank finance group" can be made a bringing units of the financial institution of D√ºsseldorf together with the Frankfurt deca-bank. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The WestLB would bring in a "competence block" with a lasting earning power to such a business. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And such a connection can be the decisive annoyance in the country banking sector to further groupings at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Then it gets if an executive board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult time. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Because the shattered WestLB still is under an enormous pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Only on the part of the EU commission but also by the Federal Institute for financial service supervision which has only recently made clear to the Nordrhein Westphalian Land government the time is not pressing to find a future solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> From a connection taken like always between the deca-bank which savings bank customers know because of their investment funds and the WestLB the talk is also on Frankfurt side already for some time, though. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Approximately the Helaba has let deca-bank boss know Franz Waas at the end of August on the presentation of the half dates in a fusion of the house at the Mainz secondary road with a regional bank or, the WestLB, it doesn't see meaning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But the administrative board has this one deca-, this one are shared by the regional banks and the savings bank associations, engage the executive board to hold conversations about common business activities with the WestLB. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It could be all about the capital market business or parts of it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It has the conversations admittedly, is so called at the financial center, started just. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> For the first time, the talk isn't from the deca-bank which counts Frankfurt as one of the more important employers with its 3000 employees at the financial center if it is all about consolidation in the savings bank sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2003 it looked for a moment for a long time as if the deca-bank can merge with the regional bank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This three federation turned, however, into nothing. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The plans had hardly got public, the Hessian Land government voiced against a participation of the Helaba in it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The two other houses not found thereupon to each other either. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The regional bank Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank Baden-Wurttemberg in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But there have been intellectual games about a connection of the deca-bank with regional banks again and again. </seg>
<seg id="21"> G√ºnther Merl, chairman of the executive board the Helaba, had voiced against experimental games about a joining with his house last, though. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Independently of it, the knowledge of maturing seems, however, that a moving the different houses of the sector under public law closer together is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="23"> After the regional election is in Bavaria over now, a connection of the BayernLB with the regional bank Baden-Wurttemberg details back could first. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This isn't a piece of good news for the Helaba absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="25"> If the pressure should increase to further fusions, the partners go out her after and after for this. </seg>
<seg id="26"> It would be junior partner in the south only more, although, till now, they got far better through the financial crisis as the houses has in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The west in turn this one has LB for savings banks and bolts unite giro association Hesse Thuringia at the beginning of the year which is involved in the Helaba with 85 per cent pushed forward a join with. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Had if need be the north LB left. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, such geostrategischen considerations are only this side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is on the other one all about the question how the different business models of the individual houses match each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Merl said in June, till now, the decisive question with which business model the Zukunftf√§higkeit of the regional banks shall be guaranteed hadn't been answered by the German savings banks and giro association. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> At the end a taking apart also could the west LB which isn't wished there of course, though be. </seg>
<seg id="33"> So the talk also is in the letter of this executive board there, then, in any case a "complete solution" for the house is striven for. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Has units brought with the deca-bank under a hat, will let himself be seen still join like this with this single. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The German bank system is relatively stable, Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbr√ºck emphasized week only in this one formerly. </seg>
<seg id="3"> How good, that the politician used the word "relative" and also einflocht, that the German banking sector isn't spared by the krisenhaften developments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Because this one has entered at the weekend now. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This one in the DAX quoted Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo real Estate (HRE) gets a billion loan from a syndicate of German banks to protect himself from the turbulences on the markets. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday the credit helps amounted to up to 35 billions euro. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Hypo real Estate must pay interest on only the part which it also takes up. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The money comes both of private banks as also under public law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Losses are background at the daughter Depfa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Extremely quickly, the Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself according to a newspaper report for long period projects for which it has awarded money, what is meanwhile no longer possible because of the distrust on the markets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the first six months of 2008 the bar reserve of the bank had shrunk by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, the return on equity also had easily given way from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The regular yields and the net proceeds out of finance business had fallen to zero compared with the year-earlier period, the yields from ascriptions to demands and certain securities as well as from the dissolving of provisions in the credit transaction around more than sunk 70 per cent on 5 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Only thanks to higher returns on refunds of after stored charging costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the refund of interest according to the Internal Revenue Code and from the Gesch√§ftsbesorgung for group enterprises the yield minus had dropped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In the year 1990, formerly, Staatsfinanzierer had this one been out in its calculations after its privatization at first with commercial property loans which then had been hived off in the Aareal Bank. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because one earned too little in the classic state financing the Depfa then had increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint ventures of private investors and the state of dedicated (Private PUBLIC-Partnership, PPP) and international diversifizierrt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Hypo real Estate must carry out deductions now on the value of the daughter which will have an "essential material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it hotly rakes uncertainly. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is fact that the dividend was cut. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Already for 2007 she had been shortened around two thirds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The Hypo real Estate is an important state and Infrastrukturfinanzierer since the Depfa take-over. </seg>
<seg id="20"> She is depending stronger than other institutes of the refinancing at the interbank market since she doesn't have any customer deposits. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With the collapse of the American investment bench Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the credit award has dried up under the banks largely again since the banks hoard their liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Hypo real Estate needs the credit portfolio for a part, about 50 billion euros, the Depfa short-term remedies for the refinancing every year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> After communication of the Hypo real Estate the financial requirement of the group is covered with the loan until foreseeable future and the enterprise protected "from the influence of the currently largely broken-down international money markets". </seg>
<seg id="24"> It can be heard from other sources that thanks to the monies the refinancing is safeguarded by the end of 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The HRE chairman of the executive board Georg Funke explained, against this that must Hypo real Estate Group doesn't become the money markets until foreseeable future any more take up. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Federal Bank and the Federal Institute of financial service supervision (BaFin) assume that the market ability of the Hypo real Estate group is safeguarded now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But probably doesn't give the crisis any certainty in view of the dynamics and imponderabilities. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It even isn't unthinkable that the financing doesn't have to be taken up on a full scale. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The opposite isn't auszuschlei√üen but either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> After according to rumor the bank still faced the insolvency on the late Sunday evening the at least temporary rescue also isn't able to calm the people. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The share price breaks in by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The loan courses keep themselves quite good against this. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The prior-ranking debts hardly show themselves busy, the courses of the after-rank loans give way more considerably last. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The loans of the former subsidiary firm W√ºrttemberg Hypo and understandably enough the over 2009 running times going out are concerned primarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If Hypo real Estate loans seem formerly a speculative plant alternative, then the value must be looked at when dependent on the stability of the international financial system itself after the clear increase of the bank crisis and the institute which had fetched the crisis only into the house with the take-over of the Depfa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> An amortization of the pensions in due time can be started out from as long as the central banks, governments and less shattered commercial banks are still ready for the support of the system, as long as. </seg>
<seg id="38"> - or else what dares at present to hope for somebody hardly enters that the financial crisis is overcome within the next 15 months. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> But at present the reports estimating themselves with the partial nationalization have become only a legitimate hope from the probability bordering on safety. </seg>
<seg id="40"> This might prepare long time creditors primarily, whether with the decision some sleepless nights they shall part with their engagements. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, shall introduce itself at the Tachibana Highschool on the first schoolday, the girls begin to giggle: "Kawaii" is the Germans totally! </seg>
<seg id="3"> What this means? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas -- it exchange-lied told in the new one of Japan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "The first schoolday in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was excited. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I had Bammel already in front of the way to school. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of the Kawasaki and go to Tachibana Highschool by train 40 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The way I had alone to think I fortunately haven't got lost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The lessons beginning seems not fixed at the Tachibana so strictly as in the case of us at home in Lower Saxony. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The pupils spin, as of eight o'clock one a short meeting round starts with the teacher until twenty to nine, the 'Home room'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But before the lesson started it was my turn to introduce myself. </seg>
<seg id="13"> I am not the type in front of a class to this from 40 pupils at all yet who likes to speak in front of people. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because I didn't have any school uniform yet I have an old skirt of my guest mother blouse, blue knee-socks and black leather shoes dressedly, to this. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In this elevator I have so gone and in front of the desk stood and tried to say everything correctly: I Sayonara am called Sylvana, come from Germany and have in a week birthday ' where she Sylvana ... '. </seg>
<seg id="16"> I was very glad at the moment that I had already begun more than two years ago to learn the language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The 31 girls in the class have whispered everyone, giggled and waved and I have heard the word "Kawaii" continually. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I already knew this from my Mangas. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is part of the over-essential vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cutely, sweetly'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> I then have darted fast onto my place. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The girl next to me has grinned rather broadly, she found an honor that the exchange pupil should sit besides it. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The rest of the hour was rather quiet anyway when the gong sounded I was bombarded really. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Everyone talked at once and giggled and holes asked for me into the belly -- it is extremely hard to understand Japanese English. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> All its Bentos then unpacked in the break. </seg>
<seg id="25"> My guest mother also had made such a Lunchbox to me -- this is something else than the deserted German somethings to eat at break. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> I usually don't have any pale glimmer what exactly I eat here in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The things look strange and taste completely new. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Tightly stands, that everything is extremely delicious. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Naja, except for the plums marinated saltily perhaps, brrrr! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Bentos aren't only simply lunches at Japanese schools. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Sometimes it happens in the hope to get to know the boy at the Pausensnack better that a girl gives a boy a Bento prepared which particularly artistically then gets it ready. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Of this I have read in my Manga comic strips. </seg>
<seg id="34"> I am curious whether I also can watch this here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Of all things Japan?mean friends asked, as me them told that I want to go in Tokyo to school for a year ' why because ', have me. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I then have always said: </seg>
<seg id="37"> "Because it fascinates me now." </seg>
<seg id="38"> After all, I read best of all Mangas already for years. </seg>
<seg id="39"> And, sometime, so that I understand the comic strips and the culture better, I have begun to study a bit Japanese, too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> For me, so it was completely clear that I had to travel here sometime. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Because I also have a liking for tradition and customs. </seg>
<seg id="42"> One puts great value and on the here. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Japan on the one hand is a country of the latest technologies and trends -- it is strict, disciplined and traditional on the other side. </seg>
<seg id="44"> And because everything is organized so well, I have felt not lost here either even if Tokyo is the largest town which I have ever seen." </seg>

<seg id="5"> Contributions of famous scientists have been published in the Internet magazine "Edge" for several years. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Mirror online presented in a series' select answers to the question "thinks" what to be able prove you for true, without it? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I think that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions without otherwise me or somebody being able to prove this till now where we cannot even that other people have consciousness prove. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But in this case we may hope at least since all human brains show the same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> And questions we cut, enter a rough area because the hardware doesn't agree as soon as we turn to however other species the feel or quite generally the consciousness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat gets into danger, it does the same like many other animals: It plays dead, escapes or attacks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People behave like themselves on experiencing a comparable one subjectively infer some scientists from what. </seg>
<seg id="12"> I don't believe in it, though. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer to it experiencing us subjectively of animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with the human consciousness include the lateral pr√§frontalen Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the execution-/ control functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This broad region, with man, is developed much more highly than at the other priorities and seems to be missing with other creatures completely. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So reason for the assumption that man is even different from the other priorities insists to plan and to decide the knowledge who we are and the ability under this at least at those aspects of our consciousness which depend on the pr√§frontalen Cortex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another dramatic peculiarity might lie in the language nature of man: Such a large portion it is connected to language, is often said the consciousness depends on it since experience his. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case one could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But even if consciousness wouldn't depend on language this would influence it certainly so that consciousness-ours would be different himself may be animal consciousness would be entitled, obtain like it also, probable very much of most. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Therefore is hard to find out how consciousness may look among other animals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If it can be neither measured nor analyzed because of the special hardware using our own experience as a little internal and subjective, then its investigation confronts us with great problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my explanations refer experience on the contents of the conscious but still there is another aspect of the consciousness besides that which more simply might scientifically be accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without consideration for their contents and this exactly happens at studies of the short-term memory of priorities particularly at the example of the visualization. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But at this approach which Christof cook and Francis Crick followed one rather resorts to the neuralen correlates of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or also not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This approach interestingly enough also emphasizes the significance of the pr√§frontalen Cortex for the taking place of the visualization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What gives up for the feelings now? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I explain it by it, that an emotional system like that one of the fear is activated in a conscious of its own activity brain. </seg>
<seg id="28"> So what we describe as "fear" the activity of the defense system identified in the brain (or its consequences, how physical reactions) are the mental condition in which we are if working memory covers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So seen feelings are tied narrowly to the regions of the Cortex which honor primacies and man. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Ascribing fine graduations of feeling also others around them next to us ourselves because we can differentiate and categorize conditions with the help of the words and the grammar to themselves connectedly to the language nature devotedly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Antonio Damasio on the other hand thinks, for example, that more concentrates, however, the himself, feelings result from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the Cortex and the brainstorm like Jaak Pankseep on the brainstorm. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Since this network hasn't changed itself very much in the course of the human evolution, it can absolutely be involved in genre general feelings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> I purely theoretically cannot contradict this it regards, however, as unbeweisbar. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues what appears with rats and people like fear feels probably also in the two cases that way: How can one check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly, however? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Flees a cockroach whether in case of danger it also feels fear? </seg>
<seg id="36"> Bare behavior similarity cannot prove any Erlebensgleichheit in my eyes yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Although the neurale comparison helps along: Rats and people don't even have similar brainstorms, cockroaches a brain against this. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the brainstorm is responsible for feelings? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if one could prove this for man: How did one want to prove it with rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I think that have feelings rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows), ?. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I wouldn't know how I should prove this. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because her feelings are presumably basically different from ours (since the human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> At all events progress is in store here at the neuralen level provided that one measures the same with rats and people. </seg>
<seg id="44"> I don't know how I don't investigate language and consciousness, not feelings, among rats so either, whether anyway they exist. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One may regard this as nearsighted but I prefer to get on but permanently to run against a wall. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I am just a practical Emotionalist. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In first half of the year 2008, in Europe, flights and overnight stays were cheaper than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Flights got even up to 50 per cent cheaper according to a current study in Germany. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Flights and overnight stays in hotels have got more favorable again, this is the result of a study of the journey and financial service provider American Express. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The enterprise has analyzed its booking data from the first six months of 2008 and established a clear burglary after a rising of the prices in the first quarter in the second quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> After the prices have increased on the hotel market for years, the overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The prices in 41 still increased by on an average 6.9 per cent from 48 examined European towns from January until March in comparison with 2007. </seg>
<seg id="8"> However, the prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year from April until June. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Most considerably has been the trend in Paris and Rome where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 per cent less as a year before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> As a reason for it American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate which has led to a relieving "travel urge" of American tourists. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Financial centers like Frankfurt or London are also concerned by the fall in the hotel prices more strongly than industry locations like Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The hotel prices hold even the record with an increase in 26.3 per cent in the Norwegian town in Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The trend still pointed up also at the airfares in the first quarter: </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The prices for plane tickets of the economy class dropped by on an average 12.5 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter from April until June, the price changes were, however, far more minor in the business and roof ridge Class. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The prices collapsed in Germany still more strongly than in other European countries: </seg>
<seg id="17"> The prices had increased by 11.9 per cent from January until March, in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The prices even have halved themselves according to the study on German domestic flights. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The enterprise explains reason for the collapse of prices is on the one hand the economic growth falling off. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The demand in many segments of the flight market crumbles. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the other hand there is an increased competitive pressure by the Open-Skies agreement which decontrols the air traffic between the USA and Europe. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The cut unprofitabler ways for Airlines as well as the high number of the airline companies which would have declared themselves bankrupt in the first six months of 2008 is sign of the tense situation, these were alone in Europe for 24 airline companies. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Debate around a bilingual education: Education in English-speaking surroundings </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In this version of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Leading scientific employee in Kalifonischen studies and leading director in the school education sciences at the Pacific research institute for PUBLIC Policy, Lance T. Izumi, a co-author of the book is " not thinks as well as one: Why the middle classes need a school choice ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> It is a complicated task to appeal to the Hispanic voters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Barrack Obamas suggestions to the education topic are a typical example of it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obamas election campaign mentions, " the probability to lock the school with afro American and Hispanic pupils successfully, this is lower than with white pupils " -- what is correct. </seg>
<seg id="7"> To close this performance distance, Obamas education plan recommends a bilingual transitional phase especially under others in the education for those which first learn English. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The question to Obama nevertheless consists, whether its use contradicts its interest for the bilingual education which puts the main emphasis on lessons in other languages than English to reduce the distance in the school performances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> We take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", an elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Are the majority of the pupils Hispanic and come from families with a low income. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third party of the pupils from whom many are in the country only for a short time learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There has nevertheless existed the state examination on a good standard in 2008 astonishing one 100 per cent pupils of the fourth class in math. </seg>
<seg id="13"> 93 per cent of the children were also surprisingly judged from the fourth school year in the English examination when good. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This astonishing success was achieved with other methods as those which are preferred by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school Sixth Street puts its main emphasis on check and exercise on steady control of the knowledge and an attitude which doesn't tolerate any exceptions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Furthermore the school practices the approach according to which the education goes in English-speaking surroundings. Exactly this is the point which Obama shall take into account, so the principal Linda Mikels. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach attaches importance to the almost ausschliesslichen use of the English language in the subject lesson. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The idea more bilingually education declines, said to me Mrs Mikels, this one the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil who had come from Mexico only shortly before this. 12 months later one would be able to enter the classroom and to not recognize it any more. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It works", she said, "it works for us". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with great share in Latin American and other pupils learning English? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The performances of the school would make the answer to this question easy but the politico-educational positions within its own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support the idea of bilingual education already for a long time) and its own consistent support of the bilingual education make forecasts answer uncertain over Obamas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While he is agreing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently has the trivialisiert topic by saying that people should stop, worries over these make a transitive legislation to themselves in "only English". </seg>
<seg id="23"> He said instead: "You shall make sure that your child can speak Spanish". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama wants to close the performance distance actually, it shall carefully take into account education models which work instead of disdaining them and to trivialisieren. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Well rested Gebrselassie beats its world's record </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia which has made the distance of 42.2 kilometers in some as 2 hours and 4 minutes has after it has broken its own record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and has become the first person shown again why some think it for the best long-distance runner of all times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the victory at the flat course in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie has a previous result of 2:04:26 improves his by 27 seconds which it had reached in Berlin last year. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Gebrselassie, 35, has his 26th world's record in its versatile career in which it at least reaches a World Cup title or has a world's record built up to the marathon on every stretch of a kilometer builds with that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Gebrselassie has left the Olympic marathon out that in Beijing the air pollution could make its asthma problems worse last month out of fear which, afterward, perhaps was exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="6"> He has applied for the competition in Berlin instead. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In almost ideal conditions at sun and 9 degrees of the start and 13 degrees of the aim Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Since train runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long distances is the record time has fallen for marathon within the last 10 years by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo has won Costa over for Brazil in 1998 with the result 2:06:05 there in Berlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After its victory on Sunday Gebrselassie has informed the press it would have had cramps two weeks ago in its calf and therefore couldn't exercise a week. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Obviously he has come back refreshed after break and not rusted up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I am so happy", he said to reporters. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Everything has run perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="13">  I have resumed the training a week ago and, today, had still some doubts but at the end what everything super." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It was criticized for this him particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa, that he excessively orchestrates his racing runs, avoids many world's best marathon stars generally, relies on the racing leaders too much as if this would be a train racing and puts world's records about the competition. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But this criticism hardly harms the size Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Accompanied by four Kenyans Gebrselassie had reached the center of the way in 1:02:04 on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Furthermore two Elitel√§ufer from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have Gebrselassie challenges after the speed doers had gone off. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Gebrselassie has a little more than three miles from the finish made its last beginning to part with Kwambai which has arrived as second in 2:05:36 and has improved its best time by almost 5 minutes with that. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Kamathi became a third party in 2:07:48. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakstan and now German have completed among women a considerable year by having shown the siebtschnellste result of all times with 2:19:19. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The world's record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The 36 years old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London marathon in 2:24:14 last spring. </seg>
<seg id="23"> She has the games in Beijing missed because of problems, these as a back injury, described were. She has, however, recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes. </seg>

<seg id="24"> It has planned its run skillfully by a quartet let only ausreissen, overtook, however, after 30 kilometers her from Ethiopian and Kenyan runners. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The pride and the hardships in the life of the black population in a town of the quite special type </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hidden a quiet town in which the pride and the complications of the Afro American culture appear few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle is located in a radius of Orlando between the excesses of the amusement parks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> It is Eatonville, the first completely black city of in the country and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, to describe no longer as simply as Hurston did it in 1935: "the town with 5 seas, three Krocketpl√§tzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more as enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison." </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays it is a pilgrim place. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are Zora to the annual one! Festival come in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem renaissance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And nevertheless is and remains the town which describes her? federal writer project you produced and this one made her to it to a tourist destination of the outing times of the depression of this to this one by accepting it into the Florida guidebook? in many respects a place of the quite special kind. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This one is so independently, purely and privately Eatonville like into 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black municipalities often refused in Florida to share their true thoughts with the white man ", so some over us Weiss that he not Weiss what escapes him ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even nowadays in a year about race conditions a black Pr√§sidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, calls upon for an open conversation in this, many are tired of being watched by Aussenseitern here furthermore. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> We are " told very concernedly about it like our history so Hortense Jones, 59, is ", from birth an inhabitant of the town and a municipality member of the oldest church of the town. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must be correct." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of the triumph and the fight. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is both a historical example of the black movement and a municipality of almost 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty quota is twice as high as the country average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example are on the one hand -- this one culture of the rural south which is sentenced sometimes and sometimes praised -- black which has its roots in the American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It isn't surprising that inhabitants are both proud and on the watch here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And really the doubts started with image actually around Eatonville with Zora, how here all Hurston call. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She introduced her hometown to the world like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) in books which came from hearts and were written in dialect </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five paragraphs in the Floridareisef√ºhrer changed the town which completely lies near the route 77 this one through this often forgotten center of Florida leads to the scenes of black history and human drama, a street. </seg>
<seg id="18"> First mayor, Joe Clarke, impudent and in the literature Hurston reader led to the store of Eatonvilles as Oskar both in the actual life and turned then to more private matters. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It wrote, ", " offside the street to the left hand the modern school painted brown Weiss is with its well-tended gardens and playgrounds about which Howard Miller always cares although he can hardly read and write." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> She mentioned the new husband of widow also -- and wrote that " lee Glenn sells drinks of any type also and what always fits to hour rooms ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> So in only few hundred words Hurston brought Eatonville with self-government in connection but also with illiteracy rate, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This wasn't quite certainly a guidebook. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> This indeed wasn't a portrait which was valued by everyone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Zora "described" the things as they were, so, so one of the Johnson girls who more fully more sexually were allusions immortalized the Hurston by quoting the men, singing beauty about hers the the 90-year-old. </seg>
<seg id="25"> She added: "Some people didn't like this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric here, the regelm√§ssig returned after its family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that this one is conceited in a noisy Chevrolet smoking and dressed in trousers in a town about her venerable clothes style today if Hurston came to the town rinsed off, it usually did this without warning. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to the Mr Franklin most inhabitants were fascinated whereas many disdained them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "People were always glad to see Zora", said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But it never "stayed", added too long he was baptized in all probability in the Hurston there while he was rocking in his chair on a terrace lain to behind which looks at the Sabelia lake. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As Hurston in 1960 poor and its books died it was unavailable. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Together with the large part of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although she was a famous author once, a Zeitgen√∂ssin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard college into the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> There wasn't any great commemoration, no public readings in the great style, in Eatonville. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "I don't think that they have understood their contribution in the world or their inheritance in the least", was published for Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography the 2003 about Hurston so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The turn came in the eighties. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track freeway through the town to replace the Kennedy boulevard, the slow double-track main street of the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlando's suburbs had already pressed the freeway 4 by the western outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The suggestion was presented when Eatonville still recovered in its history from a difficult phase. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Among other things compulsion had set an end the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality integration. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The fight against race intermixing caused hate to the community in the fifties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "A heap of white boys often came and they threw oranges and things on out of the way sedentary people at this time", said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "Once a woman even gave this one killed it was. </seg>
<seg id="44"> You threw a watermelon out of the car." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In 1955 Hurston analyzed the demand of the colonel the decision in the case Brown against the schools inspector in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, to force integration, by it as " offending instead respecting my race " court of justice described. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Nowadays inhabitants say that this one weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its teenagers them, although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in many a regard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Black children were used to being hugged " so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the charitable group to the protection of the Eatonville community one hugged his teacher in the morning and one hugged his teacher in the evening ", I remember. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> This could be maintained so long, added her until teachers and pupils didn't come from the same place any more. </seg>
<seg id="49"> One didn't hug his white teacher mine is availably a cultural ravine there I said to Mrs Nathiri because he was a white teacher " -- ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> How have, however, the civil rights with positive self-confidence and statements contributed that place was made for further Zora Neale Hurstons, black authors, it did to actor and artist who disregarded prejudices like them? "How himself can somebody refuse my society the joy! </seg>
<seg id="51"> I don't understand it." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In the year 1975 the writer Alice got fullers on the way to Hurstons nameless grave and started to fight for the resuscitation of their glory. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Five years later a Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway praised much could be found in the bookshelves and made them a part of the American literature canon once more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The highway project came exactly at a time, the most famous daughter was in the focus of the attention in the Eatonvilles once again. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And Hurstons saw old neighbors her as a rescuer this time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> What the district could destroy with the making of the freeway started in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival to point the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later and many return for the celebration every January. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> The district turned away from his street building plans for some years later. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "The plans of a five-track highway" stimulated the town, accelerated the whole with top speed, aroused real citizen pride, said Mrs Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Mrs Boyd a little more simply expressed it: "Zora saved Eatonville." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change of the self picture of the town. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Zugereiste like Rachelle Munson, an advocate who goes here to the church since 1993 and natives started to value the past newly, came more and more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eatonville was included in the nationwide historical register in 1998. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new two-storey library (of course to Hurston named) opened in 2006 on the Kennedy surfaced new and beautified boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Nowadays Eatonville is still an unusual feature in Florida: sometimes it can feel of the town center of Orlando like a backstreet in the summer rain, only 6 miles as smally as at that time as it was founded by only 27 black families into the 1880s. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (Nowadays is you to 90% black.) </seg>
<seg id="67"> Outsiders on the search for the history Eatonvilles and its meaning are often still treated with caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most interviews an approval is necessary in the front-end and certain things like the wall painting of Eatonvilles of the oldest church which was painted of a white and represents black men at the fieldwork may not be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for deep red still fear that their protected community is misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And nevertheless became the Hurston festival more greatly, an increased degree of native country pride also got born at the same time to it. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Primarily young people tend to see Eatonville just like Hurston saw their complete race: lovely, with all its problems, bad even better and just as impressive, creative and hard-working, silly and mixes like every other races and people group in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It the sincere love for this town is this one one can hear nephews in the voice of Mr Franklins who intends to return to Eatonville after the college who could use a little help according to him, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, to work in the municipal authority or at the police. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even the Youngers, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> "Most people who go through only here will think: "Oh, nothing is this town in comparison with all the others", Alondra Kenon recently said to the church on a Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="75"> "But if one actually stops and looks at his history for a moment, it is a very beautiful town." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' of Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s Jos√© Luis Carci represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spaniards in 'Sangre de Mayo' against the Frenchmen. This is an admirable film in the Filmografie with an around 15 million euros investment for the lathe works. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Guti√©rrez and Paula Echevarr√≠a at the beginning of a long list of the actors this way the cineaste has tried 'to represent an amount of personalities and social analysis', what he has always admired at the works of the famous novelist. </seg>
<seg id="4"> With a film length of more as two and a half hours 'Sangre de Mayo' is presented in cinemas on Friday and shown on the transmitter Telemadrid as a four-hour small series later to these. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Assured to Jos√© Luis Garci, tall fan of the literature of Gald√≥s, that thanks to this lathe work his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. It has this one to thank Esperanza Aguirre for it, Madrid engaged it to shoot a commemorative film to the second Jahrhundertsfeier in Madrid on November 2nd three years ago of the autonomous community. Primarily because the story on the basis of 'Episodios Nacionales' is based, this one accepted the order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The picture of this Garci offers, how it caused the complete contribution of 15 million which was made by the autonomous community for lathe works to Madrid ' tangled Spain which chose the wrong leader for the fight up because the people by the fight for the independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of the VII in delay took had been to represent, the 'single possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding Bekleidungen, '. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The cineaste isn't, however, that with the financing as in the case of 'Alatriste' or ' //de// ' (twice so high as at ' //de// ') sorry one Lo's fantasmas could, because of this Goya some scenes could from the film script with Horacio Valc√°rcel, with the Garci almost its whole career cooperated, not shifted, count Sangre be Mayo. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For this reason Garci which was also a film director in 'Volver are empezar' has played a part by its ordinary mode of operation: it adapted itself to the stage to the actors, with which one must rehearse first before what one begins to shift and for those which hadn't made any casting turned up it ' humiliating a part of the profession of the film director consists 'and providing with respect, ' in helping in the theater and in the cinema to know in the cinema industry in which one works, happens.' </seg>
<seg id="9"> Many actors they run in 'Sangre de Mayo' into must repeat in front of their camera like in the case of Miguel Rell√°n Carlos Larra√±aga or Fernando Guill√©n Cuervo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations it (has) won one of which, is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain this year in front of the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Sangre neither ' //de// Mayo neither ' nor ' Siete mesas //de// billar franc√©s ' and finally also not the select film 'lot girasoles ciegos'. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For this film Garci doesn't expect any awards. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the beginning you think ', that you work for the descendants, you notice later that it is for prospering only and you are content now if one has still produced a film ', Garci declares 30 years work after more. </seg>

<seg id="1"> For the Olympic Games the streets are unsatisfactory in Madrid. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is the dream of many of us to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012 it really can be 2016 perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for this?' </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yes, we follow the example of the old streets I say that it isn't correct! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It became judgement as perfect street described and mine after, it was the worst street with everything around this and at this which there was. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Of course this is if one would notice the assessment and I could check it obviously wouldn't something like that be a lot of nonsense come through. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But we go through everything from the beginning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The nonsense begins with the Ticketholen which permits you to go when the former. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Chip it doesn't seem to me either to be bad but they also should then, if they let already you proceed, give you everything (inclusive, to avoid around the jams in the street). </seg>
<seg id="10"> So not. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here they let you fetch only the ticket (the first nonsense which consists in going there only because of this) and (after an infinite queue), there the surprise is! There was the T-shirt a second nonsense only in the size 'S' (because I need the size XL) </seg>
<seg id="12"> Where do we live actually, then? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Or is it so that it was decided after the crisis to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less substance? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Therefore, well, things like this are a small thing in the street in comparison with the days. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Except for it it is already of at least 15 minutes a queue there that one must go very early to fetch the chip and in addition, one must leave the rucksack. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes which is difficult to understand in the case of a street where 11 000 people are expected. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Finally as it also had to be expected, began the street and we didn't have our moving bags in front of that to be left even if it had turned out well once but they to be fetched back had already more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, it saw, within these 40 minutes waiting time after rain so that it came to the temptation organize a revolt and attack the cottage. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I think some 500 people surely will have pneumonia and some like me will because of this chip, which got I have, at the classification seem punctual, even I cannot imagine already that the exit was postmarked wrongly mornings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> If one would ask me for a perfect street, this street would of course never occur to me. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So I think we still will dream of a town for a long time which is prepared well for the Olympic Games </seg>

<seg id="1"> Microsoft on the search for a (virtual) Rezeptionistin </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> >> Auf der `Emerging Technology Conference', veranstalte von MIT, hat Microsoft den Fortschritt des neuen Bilderkennungssystems und der Mensch-Interaktion vorgestellt, ein Wesen der k√ºnstlichen Intelligenz ohne viel Intelligenz, welches jedoch f√§hig ist, einige primitive Aufgaben zu erledigen, wie zum Beispiel ein Taxi bestellen (oder im Fall von Microsoft ist das ein Routenplaner, um sich auf dem Campus des Unternehmens zu bewegen). The system takes what it hears during the conversation into account. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Thanks to a camera and a form and Gesichterkennungssystem this 'Rezeptionistin' can recognize how many persons are in the room who they are and remember even itself it can as they were dressed listened and the keywords conversation get on it. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It also can put in order the persons present after the conversations into the groups. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the presentation video 'the Rezeptionistin' notices a third person but it understands that this person isn't accompanying to the group which holds its conversation and that no company employee is either. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She enquires whether the person here wants to pay a visit to somebody and answers that he will listen soon. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Everything without the blue screenshot </seg>
<seg id="8"> Impressive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> This is surely the future. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The enterprise has better things now for example on the next version of her operating system Windows it can concentrate on. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One talked very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft this week. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many tied programs. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Steve Ballmer stated that, five times, she would then, if the computers were equipped with the most necessary one instead of filling her with the commercial garbage, work faster. Yes, Steven, this only becomes man the some for be. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Everything is only an observation if one considers that Microsoft caused function and 'Extras' one or others in Windows versions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The change of direction is worthwhile </seg>
<seg id="16"> Microsoft is right, this the operating system loses gradually meaning exactly like the software. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As Google chrome in the net appeared, was a part of the theory this that it is the first step of Google to compete with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Many skillfully pointed out that the browser isn't an operating system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The operating system as an indispensable part will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The operating system fulfills the function which can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband if it is all about to inform his mother-in-law about something. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> This is correct. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The system will never disappear but one must think not when an absolute one but as a relative truth of his 'death'. </seg>
<seg id="23"> What this week told Ballmer is the confirmation of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The people give the operating system less attention more, for this the Web browser every time. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It becomes the computer to execute the Explorer or chrome and every day spend we around the Firefox, started only, more time at the surfing than in the surroundings of the 'windows'. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What does the half serve applications in the computer more availably for? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Some are more </seg>
<seg id="28"> And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than sight. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Lighten less complicatedly, not exaggerated so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> More consists the interest in integrating its online services which then finally can become the alternative to Google of Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the reality they need this without doubt. I bring a small example of it. </seg>
<seg id="32"> I have the photo of this place in Redmond, made in one of the relaxation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Refreshment drinks machine is a shield on this fastens: 'Your search. Our future '. It prints a request to use tool of one's own for online search. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In the year 2006 an independent study added to the end that this one was of use the 66% for employees at Microsoft, Google for the enquiries in the net. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The new version of the Windows mobile 7 in this by the way also was confirmed last week that delay has turned out. </seg>
<seg id="36"> She doesn't become beginning but appear at the end of 2009, sooner even 2010. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Microsoft seeks the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows mobile 7 on bring to the marks at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The telephone changes into a computer every day. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The android and the iPhon already are on the market but the other delay will cost money. </seg>

<seg id="7"> More than one was surely told by you that you have spoken at night. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This phenomenon can appear occasionally (live one times in it every day for example as lasting the high fever) or regularly (one times per week, one times in the month) ., can the child remember nothing the next day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> There isn't any single reason which causes this appearance. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Connections with other appearances in the sleep looked for, like nightmares, panic-stricken fear, often are Enuresis noctura bed-wetting, (at night), speaks in the sleep looked for, there, however, isn't any reason for it at night. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As we have already used to mention it it can to very high fiber, stress situations or overtaxing lie. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In any case this is phenomenon investigated a little. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The frequency with which it appears is very variable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It can be that one speaks quietly in single words whispers or it can completely be an opposite (cries, wines, long discussions.) </seg>
<seg id="15"> If the remark is very intensive, it is recommended to the cases to watch the child and to let advise itself with a specialist to check whether there is a problem which causes fear and this way takes place into. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> We have said that it is a positive disturbance therefore it isn't treated, it is, it is connected to another sleeplessness which can be treated (for example with the sleep apnea or with the stress). </seg>
<seg id="17"> What one can do is carry out one series of simple preventive measures: </seg>
<seg id="18"> Attempts not to excite the child before sleeping. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Quiet therefore, choose game for the child and avoid stressful stations which are terrible and a little too wild. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Among the nervous children whom diversions are recommended diversion methods can be used to help them to get a certain inner quiet. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This helps the child to sleep quietly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Keeping the quiet temptedly, if speaking in the sleep happens once. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Thinks that it is harmless for the child and, the next day, it will be able remember nothing which has happened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Useful advice </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Don't wake it up. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is useless because the child is unconscious, you will wake it from the sleep so. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Although the child speaks, it sleeps therefore it rests. </seg>
<seg id="28"> It thinks if himself shows after a couple to appearances frightened it is recommended so to let advise himself or to find out which reason the child has for the fear. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If they understand what it says (what is not so ordinary), the child doesn't put under pressure to carry out an examination and get more information back. </seg>
<seg id="30"> So you will be able achieve nothing with that because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and can't think. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In addition, you will hear what it says but you won't know what it dreams and they are carefully conclusions with the interpretation of the information and this one which you draw from it because of this why it says this. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It perhaps doesn't say to the child that hear this at night and know its secrets for her. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Not even as a joke. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This causes a lot of fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> So nothing bad causes you no worries, it is, this is a moment which lasts for only few minutes. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> On the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of the Friday a further one followed John McCain or Barack Obama to find out who resulted as a winner from it. </seg>
<seg id="3"> As expected the QGs announced for the choice both the republican and the democrats their own victory in this TV duel which should be pursued by a third of the American families. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The political analyst David Gergen guesses that John McCains performance wasn't 'brilliant' enough although quite considerable to make it possible for him still to stop his fall in the choice surveys five weeks before the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Gallup institute by which an opinion poll was published on Saturday which lies according to Obama with five points in front (49% to 44% for Mccain) thinks that the democrat makes the better figure obviously. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="11"> Senator Obama doesn't seem he emphasized several times to understand ', that ... '. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, he assured 'I don't think that senator Obama has the necessary experience and the required knowledge to become a president'. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A target is, lectured to choice commercials this one since yesterday in the republican. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Obama itself emphasized that it represents the future. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He spoke shortly and precisely without having anybody bring himself from the setting. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He moved his ability to the foreground to take good decisions and to replace the picture which has the world of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mccain still hasn't understood, it was to have accused of to Obama in the republican, however, spare, on the other hand, a democratic choice commercial put this weekend grasped not the complete extent of the crisis which weighs heavily on the 'American of the street' '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> During the 90 minutes John McCain had to tell the debate a lot of things over me ', but nothing over you ', Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had assembled on the occasion of a choice event in north Carolina in pouring rain. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He mentioned not even the words 'middle classes' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis provides the Americans to Obama, this one for keep the most suitable even still to save the economy on the edge of the precipice, a clear advantage. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Discussion got sure -- of the blood, that again </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday and her president, Dr. Francine D√©cary, had all reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And she has primarily recovered the confidence of the public which had deeply been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood within the 1980s and 1990s years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As one knows, the national blood reserves managed by the donation of blood service of the Canadian red cross were contaminatedly hepatitis C virus with the hi virus and this during the 1980s years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the face of this drama and the discontent of the public the government of Canada started an examination in February 1994 which is public and escorted by the judge Horace Krever which aimed to take light to the circumstances which had led to such a tragedy and to work out guidelines to prevent a renewed catastrophe of this type. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At that time, while judge Krever still was hesitating to hand in his report, several provinces adjusted a committee to the legs whose aim it was to develop a new system for the administration of blood preserved foods in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The committee fulfilled G√©lineau this order in Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the reports of G√©lineau and Krever two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec which is responsible for Quebec and the Canadian blood company, provide around the other provinces and the two territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> '1998 when Hema-Quebec has taken her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood preserved food system in Quebec, Dr. D√©cary remembers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was discouraging. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It says before it emphasizes proudly that almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec at the beginning of 2008 meanwhile won back to improve the safety of the blood preserved foods and we have the confidence of the public by the work in this field during the following years by the enormous efforts '. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr. D√©cary keeps, however, that ' a little extremely fragile in the consciousness confidence is '. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its foundation on September 28th, 1998 Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of the caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We saw the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of the Mad Cow Disease, a new nature of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob illness, in Europe at that time, this woman who holds the line since the foundation in 1998 says. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 'And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this illness over the blood could be transmitted. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore we referred to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and G√©lineau according to which one uses exclusion measures if one doesn't know this and if an illness progresses only slowly as obviously it is the case at the Creutzfeldt-Jakob illness which speaks by a degeneration of the brain what inevitably leads to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore one didn't accept blood of persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom longer than a month since 1980 in April 1999. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Well, it was proved some years ago without any doubt that this illness over the blood is transmitted. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So the principle of the caution has shown us this event that has, the used, absolutely a meaning. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A much more exact technology turned up for the reconnaissance of HIV on the market in 1999: At the tests used till now how it was the case the nucleid acid tests (NST) which make it possible to prove the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood of the donator directly and not that one of the antibodies against the virus. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST made it possible these between the time, to shorten the incubation period to which the person was infected and this, if the first viruses can be proved by our techniques in the blood, takes place, explains the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So became the risk that certain donators could be infected without knowing it and one couldn't recognize this, reduced fundamentally. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements made it possible to reduce the risk in considerable measure of transferring AIDS about a blood transfusion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Nowadays one runs the risk of from 12 million persons getting blood infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="26"> 'With other words this means that one must distribute 12 million blood preserved foods before somebody would be infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Since Hema-Quebec distributes every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserved foods, it would last more than 24 year before a case appears, was transferred at the HIV about a blood preserved food. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I think that nowadays one can feel comfortable with if one gets a blood transfusion or prescribes to restore the health ', the management boss of Hema-Quebec thinks. </seg>
<seg id="29"> 'It is our challenge for the next ten years to get the safety of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows which pathogene can reach the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year the Chikungunya virus which is transmitted by insects over the blood just like the Westnil virus has appeared on the island of R√©union. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must supervise ', incessantly Dr. D√©cary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec in addition must provide a sufficient supply besides a safe supply. </seg>
<seg id="33"> 'The need increases because the population ages. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Since the treatments are more aggressive for the cancer fighting the patients often need new red blood corpuscles or blood small plate. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The increase in the percentage of old people of the population also has an effect on the blood donor net, to this on average only 3% suitable this one to this donations of blood inhabitants of Quebec belong. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> Every healthy person can, the 18 years or is older and the suitability criteria satisfies, everyone donates blood to 56 days therefore six times in him year. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On average 14% of the persons who make their blood available are adopted not because they have fallen ill with AIDS or malaria, for example and who has traveled to a country, malaria is common in it, donations of blood get impossible for a year of this. </seg>
<seg id="38"> 'With these 3% we manage to get an inventory which corresponds to the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Lacking stocks are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But one must replace the members of this donator net if they can get older and donate no more blood. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is primarily but, hard to convince people to donate blood think them and get them to become regular donators. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Nowadays the life is so hectic that one seldom finds to spend donations of blood an hour the time ', Francine D√©cary is sorry. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema-Quebec doesn't deliver only blood preserved foods but also human fabrics among this bone transplants, cardiac valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively at heavy fire injuries. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These fabrics are examined, treated and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Rich blood is to stem cells which can serve to treat serious illnesses, such as leukemia, in the umbilical cord who was regarded as a biomedical waste earlier. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The prime minister doesn't exclude still to start elections before the end of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Yesterday, as soon as the general meeting of the liberal party came to an end, Jean Charest went after Jean talon in Quebec where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (the Left) tries to be elected in today's partial choice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> 'Moving the course of our last great limit in the north': This is the long-term aim which introduced Jean Charest with visual means during the general meeting of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis yesterday in which he completely followed the guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="5"> During his lecture a kind of picture mill was projected behind him. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Spectacular pictures of hydroelectric power stations, mines of Quebec in 'Google Maps' looked at, maps etc., turned on three gigantic screens. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Large means like during the legislative period. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The prime minister refused opposite the press by the way to rule out that he will hold the elections this fall even if he indicated that his appointment book is very full. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The 'plan the north' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the prime minister has allegedly for Quebec, namely that one of a 'new working area', this agreement with France regarding workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario provides. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although it was frequently mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister in the last time, the opening of the north, the northern area on the 49 sten degree of latitude, had never been topic of a presentation. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The prime minister confined himself to it, however, why explain oneself the north 'a jewel with an enormous potential' be, no date, no investment sums or exact priorities for the coming projects, however, called. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the most some views of on what more could be worked: Primarily at the water energy on the woods but special at the mining sector favored by the growth of the fast-developing nations and the renewal of the public infrastructures. </seg>
<seg id="13"> According to the enumeration Mr Charests the north 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, Titan and even diamonds' has. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Area is in our proximity, is in Quebec twice as big as France this '. </seg>
<seg id="15"> How it isn't only in our proximity, it is in us ', he emphasized, around clear to show that he tries to put a national founder dream into effect? </seg>
<seg id="16"> He emphasized Quebec has grown very much by its connection with the north: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James bay. </seg>
<seg id="17"> 'It belongs to us', it is our future, he added after he had had a theatrical break to look at the gigantic card behind himself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The prime minister of the press opposite explained the north, 70% of the area of Quebec, surrounds a part of Labrador which Quebec always called in. </seg>
<seg id="19"> 'This is a traditional attitude which all governments followed up. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is a border at which hasn't there been any agreement for very long time if the opportunity offers itself I will take this attitude in the name of the government again ', he explained himself. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In addition, he declared 'we must reconsider our vision newly of the north' with the climate change and talked about the northwest arcade which will be passable due to the thaw the whole year. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The prime minister thinks against this new geopolitical background that it is a duty virtually to occupy this area. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit? </seg>
<seg id="24"> The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would handle them very cautiously and that they would profit from this project the boys primarily. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Two former secretaries of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L√©tourneau (former pekistischer representatives of Ungava) have already started consultations among about thirty communities. </seg>
<seg id="26"> A secretary committee escorted of Beno√Æt Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (transportation and mineral resources) takes an important position has taken the work. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The prime minister doesn't exclude a great meeting one a common vision will itself create, ' not unconditional a peak ', but an opportunity, at which ' '. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The development of the north will take place as for the rest in agreement with the principles of the sustainable development. </seg>
<seg id="29"> he promised the plan the north will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally harmless'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it is a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers which were in the office in front of him. </seg>
<seg id="31"> 'How the liberal ones which were in the office in front of us do we have changed to convert the challenges to new growth and Entwicklungschanchen? </seg>
<seg id="32"> This was by the way one of the topics of the weekend which was opened by Jean Lesage with a great cocktail party for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the take-over of the party leaders on Friday raised again and again. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One of the adopted decisions intends to rename the power station of Beauharnois in Ad√©lard-Godbout dam. </seg>
<seg id="34"> From Godbout which has created Hydro-Quebec about Lesage which has reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water electricity to Bourassa this one has made the James bay, knew our party always ' to determine ', Jean Charest declared, the future. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It referred to a different one, this time conservative plan cover, and to be more precise to the program ' Roads to The North ' of John Diefenbaker, prime minister of 1957 to 1963., opposite the press </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> With respect to the project water-power dam Eastmain1a-Ruper which is whose putting into operation for provided in 2012 Mr Charest emphasizes. </seg>
<seg id="37"> 'This remains under us but I intend to take part', he trusted his party members on what caused approval storms with those. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The prime minister who has that 2008 and surely either 2009 wouldn't become elections geben said in April has the possibility of holding an election this fall, what, for it indeed from the law possibly is, not excluded yet. </seg>
<seg id="39"> He emphasizes primarily because of a mission of the community advice in China and a peak between Quebec and New York that his appointment book is, however, full. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The general meeting of the weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform from nationalistic plans primarily from 'aims concerning the constitution' which were accepted straight away: The PLQ demands quite particularly the recognition of the unusual feature 'of Quebec' in the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="41"> She also would want that Quebec appoints members of the advice of the Canadian broadcast and telecommunications and that these have a veto regarding the decisions made in Quebec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> On the part of the opposition the guidelines of the plan the north were taken with scepticism. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The boss the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, Pauline Marois, has the north you got back the politics got Quebec out again, has this one established the government Landry 2001 for the development. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The liberal government has done without according to her when it came to the power in 2003 using these. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Today, if it had done it, we 'would' already be much further Mrs Marois on the side of her candidate judged in Jean talon (where the choice takes place today) Fran√ßoise Mercure. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The ADQ has declared in favor of supporting the acceptance of a plan the north by the government. </seg>
<seg id="47"> 'But' what we want is that this becomes not only a great performance the party leader declared S√©bastien Proulx into representation for Mario Dumont who comes back today from the vacation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> It was Mr Vic Toews, all over-'justice' secretary (which one irony) in the high quality German white wine Harper which permitted itself to say over Louise Arbour last summer she is a 'disgrace' for Canada. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This woman himself who has waged a fight for the justice not wanting to end and all our admiration deserves to cover with ignominy so says just as much about the persons, like around the prime minister about Stephen Parker. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> We have to do it here with a government which hasn't fetched their compatriot captured in the concentration camp Guantanamo as the only one home from all the countries concerned. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A government which doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things which he is accused of happened. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The only government which breaks its word and lets a child soldier eke out a miserable existence under inhuman conditions despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva convention. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This one condescends for a justice parody to assess the fault of the defendant the only ones. </seg>
<seg id="8"> We call each other, that in memory UNICEF, Amnesty International and the union of the Canadian advocates of it plead primarily to fetch Omar Khadr home so that he gets a just process in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Exactly this government also locks the eyes before the torture: It interests little that a young adult surely will be broken for the pain spiritually after so many years for ever. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We aren't still conscious of this one but we just experience an insidious curtailment of our rights, our liberty and our 'democracy', this word which permanently carries Harper like a flag in front of self here and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth, here. </seg>
<seg id="11"> So it has come the time at which there are no more morals: One may completely maltreat, torment and lock in a Canadian citizen arbitrarily after discretion of a head of the government, to this day, which only is supported by the minority (he may completely belong ... with the minority) after October 14th. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Many voters think to find their well-being at a party which preaches virtue, law and order. But they don't see that this government has renounced what agreed on the reputation and the dignity of our country. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Liberal opinion, Orwell's talk of Barrick gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In her version of September 17th Le Devoir published a letter of Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms and the largest gold extraction company of the world one of Orwell's logics pursues that a little publishing house without means strove for a slander action more than six million against three authors and one with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they don't judge the truth primarily not in the case of slander actions but the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expected this basic difference was hidden by Mr Garver completely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Because for Barrick gold the best way to lead a public debate to drive everybody into the ruin which dares to hold an opinion set against hers is. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Identically the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will as the process ends spend considerable sums, these must to prepare their defense and fight with very dissimilar weapons against an army of advocates be paid to the gold mine from the almost inexhaustible bags. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactics at these dissimilar fights are as for the rest often to ruin the defenders to force a conjoint regulation which the opposite side silences and everybody in addition deters, which dares to deal with the question once more. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, it ought to have presented its view of the things with the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> What unlike this and would pass through, into much the countries walk in which Barrick gold works are, debates are usually delivered by the exchange of ideas and not by stick strokes in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="11"> So it would have sufficed by the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent examining teams which could have brought light in this question if the gold mine had disclosed her books and files and opened an actual debate. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick gold doesn't seem to have confidence in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a gesture aside. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Perhaps could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate simultaneously and the opinions just disregard for this public really? </seg>
<seg id="14"> This word apparently contains only the generously paid advocates and not the community of all Canadians in the world of the vice-president; a quite beautifully cramped position of the concept. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Slanderers have the right in a democracy to speak themselves. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What Barrick gold doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand are that the public which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada primarily therefore does this because it declines the brutal attitude of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments and many are aware of it not in a frame as a gag complaint (Barrick gold hasn't judged a demand on the authors of Noir Canada, in which asked it of them in the course 'of the public debate', this concept, just any more to put ...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Refrained from the surreal talk by Mr Garver the complaint is a direct attack on the liberty for the academic research and the establishment of the truth of Barrick gold which are basic every democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> She denies completely the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations which form the base of the intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it is impossible in a country like Canada to investigate and to discuss topics which the rich enterprises of this world don't like, otherwise who can do this then? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead these by following the scientific norms which were used by Noir Canada of the authors. </seg>
<seg id="22"> She has a right to answer. </seg>
<seg id="23"> For a long time, the universit√§re environment to which we belong has known how to get a grip on debates and discrepancies and to solve conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The unverh√§ltnism√§√üige complaint of Barrick gold shows clearly that it doesn't feel like a transparent debate unlike what it provides. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university world, just like for the public debate and it becomes time that the governments take up measures which limit this type of unjustified complaints. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday, the administration Bush and the leading convention representatives, republican and democrats finally came to an agreement about the most extensive economy rescue plan similarly, since the deep depression of the thirties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The new version of the plan over 700 billion U.S. dollars which shall stop the financial crisis which shakes Wall Street already for months still must be accepted by the two convention chambers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The main contents are: Better control of the representatives over the practical application of the plan to check new mechanisms around the number of houses impounded due to payment delays to safeguard the repayment of the invested public funds, new disposals, as well as the right to supervise the salaries, these to the leading ones, supported employees the enterprise paid be. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Finance secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the representative chamber Nancy Pelosi, and this one during the negotiations announced representatives of the republicans, senator Judd Gregg, present the American after a two-day negotiation marathon yesterday some minutes after midnight, the good news. </seg>
<seg id="6"> 'We have made great progress in the direction of an agreement which will be market effective', explained the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson. </seg>
<seg id="7"> 'Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street', explained the democrat. </seg>
<seg id="8"> 'This is the basic point: If we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disturbances will be enormous ', in the daily life of the Americans the republican explained Judd Gregg. </seg>
<seg id="9"> During the last two hours, the negotiations had accelerated themselves for fear of the effect which would have had a renewed failure on the atmosphere of the investors. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The period which had been agreed on was the market opening this morning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The two American candidates for the presidency who participated in the negotiations only late let themselves be seen sooner than supporter of the agreement without failing, however, to express their dissatisfaction about this that one must meet it in this extreme way. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The democratic senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain disposals, primarily such, which shall to keep their houses make it possible for the owners and such, which concerns the salaries of the executives of the enterprises saved by the state for the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="13"> 'If one asks the taxpayers to take up extraordinary measures due to certain of the irresponsibility persons, this is nothing on which one could congratulate himself. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But these measures are ', necessary he explained at the American TV stations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> You asked as him on another transmitter his republican opponent answered John McCain whether he will vote for the suggested plan: 'I would like to know the details first but I hope so. </seg>
<seg id="16"> 'The basic principles which I have read [point], that this which all of us must want to digest is a thing and with which we can want to get on. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Is not ', very simply acceptable he said to do the option, nothing at all. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The 700 billion dollar plan is aligned with it with the money of the taxpayers </seg>
<seg id="19"> It comes mortgage loans (Subprime) led before it expanded on broader forms verbreiteterer loans (PCAA) and the banks and financial institutions finally led a freezing the financial power and into the ruin 14 months after a crisis by the bursting of a property bubble triggered, these at first for the collapse of the venturesome. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It was a group of republican representatives who let the first attempt fail for the agreement last week. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Since the democrats have accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of the societies only shall be safeguarded and not bought by the government into distress, one believes himself to the dead end escaped. </seg>
<seg id="22"> To round off the viewpoints for everyone in the convention, one also has added a disposal which means that it then can impose new taxes, if the government should make losses with this program within five years, to have its invested capital returned so. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The new plan provides the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president takes it for necessary. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The payment of another 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed coordination of the convention. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In return for its help Washington gets shares in the supported enterprises which earn it dividends in the case of profits and which can sell to it again if the storm has filed past. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Federal Government will have the possibility of holding back the distraint methods regarding the apartments which are bound to the property loans affected by this plan and in addition fixing deadlines for the repayment and the compensations which are paid to the executives of the enterprises concerned. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The developers of the plan would like it, that the representative chamber coordinates already today over it, and the senate then on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Despite all her efforts it isn't sure yet that her plan will get green light. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Broader voices actually arose and the democrats against this plan both on the part of the republicans yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Quite obviously Washington 'doesn't' understand us, explained the republican to Scott Garett, a member of the finance commission of the chamber, his voters. </seg>
<seg id="31"> 'Yes, we have a great financial problem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Yes, there are solutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But the one who consists in it doesn't ask the taxpayers ' to the register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The democratic representative Brad Sherman, head of a group in the convention which is called 'the Kaukus of the sceptics', represents the things differently, however, comes to the same conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="35"> 'Four hundred excellent economy professors, among this three Nobel prize winners, have written us, around us to communicate: We ask the convention be been able to not under pressure added and too superior, which way be carefully taken can ', it explained itself yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> We got the evidence once more at the same time in Europe that it is a worldwide crisis. </seg>
<seg id="37"> During an emergency meeting the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the bank group of Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion U.S. dollars). </seg>
<seg id="38"> The intervening of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bench BNP Paribas announced that it would do without to buy up its competitor who is in great difficulties since she has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) through the crisis by the venturesome property loans in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Fortis employs 85,000 persons and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. </seg>
<seg id="40"> 'The Dutch Minister of Finance explained yesterday this isn't lost money to Wouter Bos. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In compensation we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank. </seg>
<seg id="42"> This is exactly what the savers and households value now since unsafe times are heralded. ' </seg>
<seg id="43"> During this time the British government was about just on the other side of the Channel to nationalize another bank taken from the financial crisis to distress. </seg>
<seg id="44"> According to the English press the government would take on all outstanding loans of this more than 41 billion (75.5 billion U.S. dollars) from property loans at the bench Bradford and Bringley. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The Spanish bench Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branch offices and the charge accounts of the British bank. </seg>

<seg id="54"> His previous details were namely less detailed and although he had accepted already repeatedly to report about everything comprehensively his confession is still due. </seg>
<seg id="55"> So the question remains open whether this is in his interest whether this one 50 m. have into a pact entered with it regarding the compensation of the large part of the arisen damage of hoof and whether surcharge is ready in return to take on the responsibility for socialists. </seg>
<seg id="56"> However, it is definitely possible that surcharge plays the "insulted" one now after its petitions for moderation of the detention had discovered numb ears. </seg>
<seg id="57"> While other criminals which have caused far bigger damage and not compensated for these with economy crimes are standing on free foot or at least under detention surcharge remains this possibility refuses. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Psychology of outbidding or why we are ready to pay more </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> At auctions the buyers tend to distribute more and the offered for sale to overvalue therefore. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Neurologists and economy researchers of the university of New York have managed to discover the neurological economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a study published in the "Science" magazine the people want to act not beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and therefore are ready even to pay excessive prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The researchers have tried to find out the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> National lottery should play a group of the volunteers while the other one was taking part in a playful action, in the two cases the active brain regions of the experimentees were examined by means of a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the two games the participants could win money, one became increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, though, measured in terms of with losers of the auction for this one an essential role plays outbidding the opponent. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Besides many other functions this brain region is responsible "alone for" the reward of the nervous system. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The researchers therefore thought the price increase could be explained by the avoidance of an overreaction of the Striatums. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> To support their thesis, the economists have made examinations for the backtracing of the money in addition in the researcher group. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case three groups should against a partner under different conditions con-bidding. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The control group the true value of the product was informed about, after that they have made to their uses. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Furthermore 15 dollars became reward promised another group in case they result as winners from the game. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The third group got 15 dollars before the auction which also were lost in the case of a lost game. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So the difference between the two groups consisted merely that lay the emphasis unites on winning this one, lasting at the other one on losing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, the members of the group playing "against losing" were ready for higher uses hypothesis expressed by neurologists as a proof for it than that one in the Kontroll or the "profit" group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "These results cannot be derived from any earlier economic theory. </seg>
<seg id="18"> These have justified the behaviors watched at auctions namely only with the joy at winning or the risk avoidance till now. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The inconsistency between these two theories was resolved thanks to the picture giving neurological methods so that we have a third explanation readily now " -- Andrew meant gravel, professor of the economy faculty of the university of New York. </seg>

<seg id="2"> How latest research results prove that the religious faith like a way works "painkiller" which shall already have made the death of Roman Catholic martyrs easier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Scientists the Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: The British sheet of "telegraph" reported it was examined, how far the faith in God influences the Schmerzempfinden of man. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the course of the rather bizarre examination 12 believers and each atheists received electric shocks while they were studying a painting of the mother of God. </seg>
<seg id="5"> How the results pointed, the believers could turn the large part of the pains off. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Brain scan technology even could be proved means of one, that the Roman Catholics could activate the part of their brain which is responsible for the pain regulation. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The examination was the first one in a research project in which philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university also take part next to scientists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the test a scintillating device which handed in the electric shocks was tied for the experimentees to the left hand. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to concentrate on two paintings strongly: On the one hand a picture of the mother of God painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "lady with the ermine". </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin would call Maria under the believers a kind of religious trance to come out while she was since Vincis selected picture, because it was hardly different from the other painting and when calming being found. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Spent the test subjects in a MRI scanner one half hour each and altogether 20 electric shocks got in four stages at this time while they should look at either the religious or the other painting. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Roman Catholics reported they would have felt at the sight of the mother of God "into safety" as if they were "looked" and they would have felt "quiet and peace". </seg>
<seg id="13"> They have reported about 12% less pain during looking at the religious painting as if they had Leonardo's work ahead of eyes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias who also took part in the test thought one also could cause similar effects with the atheists also with pictures which are other and seeming strong, one merely must find the corresponding photo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "We should find a picture which arouses very positive feelings such as a mother or a father", so the psychologist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "The practice the faith should change our personality and does it in many cases, too", so Wright. </seg>
<seg id="18"> After these excellent results the question which effect a Madonna picture of Leonardo or one of other comparable painter on the pain regulation of the believers had only remains. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> It is a possible reason for it that Google doesn't demand any identification codes from its users unlike Microsoft and provides with its services free of charge so that a source code updated more openly, permanently and program package seem than the official methods of the software giant to be far more attractive, more youthful and cooler. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand the Geeks are the problematic relationship of the personal right and this Internet getting it razor-sharp -- a relationship, this particularly within the last years thanks to the concept, has moved "web 2.0" into the center. </seg>

<seg id="28"> Critical observers also find the worrying counterpoles, though: So approximately the central management of a group has rejected a protest of the employees completely after the charges of the company nursery school were doubled, in addition, the employee meant the management, repeated catering is too costly. On the other hand, however, all this appears virtually mild, that Google in the year 2006 went even into the knees and agreed with an agreement in front of the Chinese government after which all regime critical hits or those which violate the good taste would be filtered out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal regulation of the group is, that no new service in advance is advertised but first if this is already available, too. The events of the next months and years could nevertheless turn something up strongly again: Reconciles mine, Googles book and Magazinscan or storage project accepts extents meanwhile while, that the enterprise must to itself explain court of justice with the colonel soon, others are rather worried so because of the Systems "Health" which makes the construction of a complete health profile possible using results, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Approximately "Scroogled" -- and the fact that Google builds up a genetic database already supplies to the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors with the substance, the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best Orwell's manner in which a man alarmingly gets approaching cash thanks to data obtained from Google. </seg>

<seg id="1"> An intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumble-bee </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> What would be the best method for the development of new technologies to the accident avoidance, to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature if not? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example that one of the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> An astonishing project at which the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumble-bees of systems avoiding accident more newly at the creation was introduced at the CEATEC in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Nissan has equipped the biol mimetic system, a mini-car, steered by car robots of the type BR23C built in cooperation with the Tokyo university with the qualities of the bees to support the development of a system with the aim which avoids any collisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Every bee forms its own, oval "private area" in the flight which is very similar to our own "shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and development of the research, said at the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The combined eye of the bee which can see in every direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees plays an important role in this. </seg>
<seg id="8"> To imitate the function of the combined eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser controlled distance knife. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This identifies obstacles in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters in front of the BR23C, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board which immediately starts the collision avoiding process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The obstacle is registered in split seconds and the car robot immediately changes the course like the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unlike previous systems this maneuver takes place purely instinctively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "If it weren't that way, the car robot couldn't react fast enough to evade the obstacles", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must a layer within which accidents are at present still valid as inevitable react instinctively and immediately since this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The complete process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they make way for other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And this must go off in the fraction of a second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The alternative solution cannot be diagonally carried out up, down or even unlike the bees, though, it only can be two-dimensional and but only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit of the tires. </seg>
<seg id="17"> While many possibilities are open to the bees here infinitely to make way for other bees, the researchers could make use of only the rotation or and of accelerating of braking at the car robot. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BR23C contains lithium Polymerbatterien which are easier and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life time lithium ion batteries when conventional. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Andoh explained it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction and less on the processing of the data and still less on the ability to save these. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This device must process merely some inputs and react to them correspondingly per second. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This must not store or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using earlier maneuvers so that, constantly, it merely takes Memory a handful kb. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It doesn't require any gigabyte and megabyte heavy Memories. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology which will be standard in production in assessment of Nissan within the next ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Further application could find the technology at the GPS satellite navigation by managing the driver around obstacles consciously and leading him to the aim so. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Half of the money shall be distributed in the first gateway. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This one reported East coast came to an end on Saturday after midnight local time, the convention representatives have made their way to an agreement about the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package after several days of debates to Reuters in a meeting. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American parliament, said "we have obtained essential progress", and thought one must only bring about the agreement to paper. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the reached compromise on the rescue package. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Minister of Finance Henry Paulson thought about the result: The program will show effect and it gets efficient, however, one still must do more. It wouldn't be all about the rescue of Wall Street here according to the Pelosi but around this, the oar of the economy rumzurei√üen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The written setting of the package was still published that is Washingtonly the time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning) before the opening of the Asian markets, however, hasn't triggered any high-altitude flight at the stock exchanges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On Monday the parliament votes on the law outline for the stabilization of the economy of 2008 first, then it is the senate's turn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on the Saturday evening and the White House also welcomed the messages about the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="11"> We are satisfied with the progress obtained in the night and the efforts of both appreciate parties, our markets stabilize and protect our economy, Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House, said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The program differs from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, though, according to which the 700 bn dollars should be spent on the purchase of securities which are bad and charged by loans suddenly. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Half of the 700 billion amount shall at most be distributed in a first tranche in which 250 bn are immediately available after the convention will as expected vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum shall be spent for the purchase of credit loaded, bad securities and more than the further 100 bn USD the president shall decide. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The program is, checked by a commission of its own this one also the president of the Federal reserve belongs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other half of the 700 bn depends on another decision of the convention. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> According to the law the Treasury also can use composite tactics: It can purchase bad loans, mortgages, and securities charged by mortgages simultaneously or loans also other "poisonous." </seg>
<seg id="17"> The purchase reported how responsible persons of the department, can be carried out both in an auction and directly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The law makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program at which the Treasury guarantees the alarming means and the enterprises pay corresponding charges to the damages to be expected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that can be provided up to 700 bn dollars as an emergency aid for the American financial system, is for the large-scale purchase of bad means, her insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk which is triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We set Paulson the necessary steps so so that we are ready for introduction of the law as soon as it was signed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The bosses of the banks got into difficulties and instructed on state help now can expect, though, that their clearances which sloppily are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang are shortened by the government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> A cut in the salaries will give it only in certain cases and these cuts will depend on it like the Treasury respectively helps out. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The cut means essentially that if purchases the department in the context of an auction, "Golden Handshake" is taxed so unless the clapped-out bank boss is deported in the pension. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In the case of a direct purchase of the bad loans the government will switch itself on aggressively to make sure that the manager salaries aren't exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Is also proper to the picture, that existing Golden Handshake-Vertr√§ge isn't changed, the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that all the more people take part in the program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is the first the democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the finance committee, the measure, commented on case in the American history that cuts are regulated at manager salaries by law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The state wins participation rights at the participating banks so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers since they also can participate as soon as the economy and thus also the bank saved feel better again. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The law outline provides that the president must present a suggestion to the convention within the next five years how the taxpayers shall get their lost money back from the finance sector again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> There were sceptics on the two sides who have expressed their doubts with respect to the plan, though. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This which protects plan isn't what ours American citizens expect the money of the taxpayers under no circumstances, so the Californian republican Darrell Issa. </seg>
<seg id="31"> His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures which are responsible also for the collapse to Wall Street were advanced by the same persons. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> In the online issue of the German news magazine established on the left Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article "Bavaria's revolution eradicates its fathers". </seg>
<seg id="6"> In opinion of the renowned political scientist the erosion of CSU already started before for a long time the sad Beckstein-Huber duo assumed its offices. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Christian Socials have replaced Bavaria over decades, the modern citizens are just turning away from them now. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The epoch break is a problem of the Christdemokratie, as also for Angela Merkel, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The disaster of CSU quite as a surprise didn't come but on Sunday what already stood out rather exactly ten years ago, though has come to an end a little: the undoubted hegemony of an official party </seg>
<seg id="10"> Ten years ago 1998 then already CSU lands at 47.7 per cent and fell thus for the first time for the fifties under the fifty per cent brand </seg>
<seg id="11"> This recurred at the parliamentary elections in 2005 three years ago that is still in the much quoted Stoiber era. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The modernization operated by CSU in the federal state consistently has in the end eradicated its own mothers and fathers. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Sociologists had forecast this already 40 years ago, however, miscalculated it in the speed considerably. But couldn't remain the secularization, the education successes, the draw without consequences from east and North German to the prospering regions of Bavaria on the faithfulness of the CSU voters. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Modernization is always accompanied by Options increase. And this has political consequences. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The right store is intact, only the voters within the store got more critical and more self-willed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is striking that within the last weeks the classic citizen groups said the biggest distance virtually to CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voter with abitur like degree. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The support of CSU sank on even under 40 per cent here. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> You decide about the destiny of the pleased duo Huber-Beckstein at the end of October </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> No heads roll despite the choice debacle in the meantime yet, the staff debates were adjourned at the head of Bavarian CSU. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Party leader Erwin Huber and governor Beckstein still stay in their offices, the question only is how long this mercy lasts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The destiny of the tandem after the disastrous 17 per cent voting loss is decided on at the extraordinary party convention at the last October weekend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, the duo scolded much had already been getting it, that it wouldn't like to stick on her armchairs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> They want to calm down the annoyed parliamentary group and the grass-roots which demanded personal consequences after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority a day with that. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Christian social union still reached 60.7 per cent five years ago, admitted under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber being at his career highlight. It could secure only 43.4 per cent of the voices now though, a year after the revolt against Stoiber. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> For 46 years, CSU was "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria which gains 18 per cent of the German GDP. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The conservatives remain the defining strength in the southern federal state also important to the Hungarian economy, however, will have to rule in a coalition in future. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As the first sign of the internal party restructurings the potential successor Hubers, vice-president and federal agrarian secretary Horst Seehofer also is tied into the reconnaissance team which helps "free voter" orientated towards the right exploratory talks over a possible Munich coalition with a liberal FDP or this one. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="13"> The CSU leadership concentrates all its strengths on the stabilization Becksteins now. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In this transition process an active role will befit Stoiber who pulled the threads out of the background till now. The former governor and CSU chairman called September 28th this one "bitterest day of his political career". </seg>

<seg id="15"> On Monday Huber made a couple of poisonous remarks in the direction of CDU -- in his opinion CSU would have earned far more support of the sister party. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> If CSU which has contributed much to the success also at a national level in 2005 should be put not again with a common show of strength on the legs, Merkel cannot become a chancellor after the parliamentary elections again in September 2009. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Merkel who hasn't made any secret out of her disappointment about the fiasco thinks that the land loss of CSU won't have an effect on the large coalition in Berlin negatively. </seg>
<seg id="19"> What is relative, though? Wounded CSU won't more easily have to be ruled and the crisis of the social democrats goes on meanwhile. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the elections on Sunday it has taken nones of representatives of the opposition to the Ukrainian parliament. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Russian observers think this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country commanded by Alexander Lukaschenko, the OECD suspects law adversities at the counting of the voices, though. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The OECD which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries hasn't respected the elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Although De legislation of the 10 million inhabitant state has got by without opposition for decades. This one has nevertheless seriously hoped for the other side assembled under the name "united democratic strengths" (ODS) before yesterday's elections that Lukaschenko which replaced its presidency mandate in the dirty elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 already for the fourth time would allow "some representative of the opposition" in the parliament this time. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore the ODS has taken distance even of the boycotts planned before. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ukraine gets economically still dependent on Russia thanks to the increasing prices at the natural gas import. Even loans were raised for the alleviation of the price increases and the country also has agreed to the disposal of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline running through the country, to the Russians. So the hope was in the background of the expectations of the opposition, the Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-profile politicians have refusal of entry because of the political system classified as antidemocratic in the EU. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The evaluation report of the elections of the OECD provided a temporary diversion, in which, instead of movements the emphasis rather on the positive one lay on the defects, such as the end shutdown of a third of the opposition candidates of the elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The fast report of the OECD criticized the campaign -- already on Monday, though, therefore opposition might not happen in the press -- and particularly the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of the voices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The opposition is able for a recovery recognize despite alledem in the political system: Political prisoners were put on free foot approximately and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by furthermore refusing south Ossetia and Abkhazia the appreciation of the independence of the renegade Georgian provinces although Russia with which the Ukraine on the paper forms a federal state has regarded the two areas as independent for a month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "We have two steps forward and unite made backward, it is, however, the most important that the dialog has started between White Russia and the EU", said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In opinion of the opposition candidate of the presidential elections of 2006 a continuation is desirable although have letting only an opposition one also to the parliament "fear got the powerful ones". </seg>
<seg id="13"> The opposition doesn't plan any protest measures in view of the results but rather tries to make the necessity of an economic reform clear to the voters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> We have to contend with many problems " -- the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way at the sales stones but I nevertheless see that more and more people support the change, even the old person " -- told Milinkewitsch in allusion to it here that not even the most supported layer of the Pensionisten approves of the Lukaschenko regime whose only income is the production of a social safety. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit merely one "is" question of time until the "social safety" bringing to mind the silence of a cemetery starts to crumble, so Milinkewitsch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Russian observers have described the elections as democratic unlike the opposition politician. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Sergej Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States explained Ria Novosti to the news agency: "The people believe the deeds and not the words". The being absent of the opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belorussian voters. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Today will do the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi Del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy for the victims of work accidents the 58th national day to steer the attention of the social institutions and media on this dramatic situation so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The data which are alarming and spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how decisive the question of the prevention is at work."the president of the republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirms the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati Ed invalidi Del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli, in his communication to the president. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The leader expresses his "great esteem for the constant engagement to the prevention at works to the protection of the injured workers, to financial assistance for the families of the victims and to the sensitization of the public opinion". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> ""Basta" has risen on this an outraged; understandable at tragedies which trigger some whirl for the public in the media and sympathy, measured in terms of their order of magnitude. But the everyday reality frequently confronts us with dramatic events which even can recur in their momentum ". </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> A European norm which limits the standard of the noise of portable music equipments on 100 dB already exists at the moment. The anxiety about the damages which could come from a too large noise load. </seg>
<seg id="12"> One can delimit these damages very much, in which one reaches for solutions like the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise abandonment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In its report the scientific committee shows the Eu, that at this these are regarded, if the users of portable music equipments listen to loud (loud than 89 decibels) music only five hours the week, regarding the maximum noise level at the job so that the legal limits are already exceeded. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Those, the music exceed this limit risk the complete loss of the hearing within of five years. </seg>
<seg id="15"> So this would concern 5-10 % of the users of such equipment whose number can open be valued between 2.5 and 10 million persons in the Eu. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A well-known American politician has much lies but to be looked at independently written, this: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti American president. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The first was Jimmy Carter, this one by his decisions which decimated economy of the USA and which cultivated relations with the befeindeten Islam (and does this as a private individual certainly today), ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The attacks against Obama are getting still more intense, straight now where the elections approach. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A lady from Miami has written in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Obama is very impudent: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation which has seen altogether two black governors and five black senators!". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Actually these attacks don't have to say a lot, however; it is racialist attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the surveys, too; everyone says that Obama with a great lead will win. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A newspaper from Mississippi in the deepest south of the United States has written in hers in the editorial: we will know only in the polling booth well whom the real American patriot will give his voice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Here a mentality of the USA appears, up to this one was held in secret lastly. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Say we will then decide what you want, for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether for Obama or for Mccain". </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. </seg>
<seg id="13"> What one a little never heard before? the success so surely seems the black candidate only now where. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In all cases despite all these considerations the definite weapon for the democrats is George Bush. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 1500 persons were questioned: Which faults has Bush made during his period of office? 89% have answered: the war in Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> America changes. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick into the bottom again. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost their life and the Americans weren't forced to pack. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The great problems come added to that the Newsroom meeting cuts, that is the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper there. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is a problem which must be solved? interviewed these journalists so? if one wants to prevent that the traditional journalism doesn't shrink fundamentally as the large audience understands him. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A clear but complicated pessimism fulfills the American journalist today. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Six of ten journalists and Executive senior of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism is national on standard on the wrong way. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is in the local area with the Executives even about 65%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Printed vs. broadcast. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It isn't difficult for the journalists to imagine in which direction the web goes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The most important publishing house groups force the way to the Internet which is seen in the printing press by many as the "killer". </seg>
<seg id="16"> The "economic pressure" which the journalists feel has increased by up to 79%. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted in the hope to want to follow the new technology "it takes something good for the journalism". </seg>
<seg id="18"> Today, the greatest rip consists in the American journalism between the editor-in-chiefs of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them. </seg>
<seg id="19"> 56% of the editor-in-chiefs are sure, their reporters share their values with them on national standard while it is merely 23% at a local level. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some think it has with the "certainty in the work" to work. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The works managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at a national level. </seg>
<seg id="22"> With the journalists it is 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The topic of the "safe work" in the team talk (.) . "our editors, note" this a current theme always is in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They wish and it becomes a question of take it or leave it so in a gigantic nation as these are the USA with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers offer the employers like it to magazines, radio and TV transmitters and Internet operators. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The editor-in-chiefs very often get very high pay, pensions and insurance monies the editor however can get only 10000 euros per month occasionally to it. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The thing concerns what the vacation, gets complicated so: crowd determined in the first year, so and so many after the third one on days to finally after a certain number of years reach 15 holidays a. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had revealed itself already some days ago when the representative chamber voted against the 700 billion dollar economy package of the White House: A tall portion of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street but to save the economy one. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms yesterday's version to the New York Times which reports how the crisis divides the republican party in the trot always more splits in its old and moderate East Coast soul, always and which business community favored this one the state institutions and that neon conservative, the and "these in Washington" the financial world hostilely contrasts and V . . are this one wins in the south and the center of the states of voter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party owes its advancement to V . are . the voice the one whom I mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This example just mentioned is only a small portion of the great changes meanwhile which the short-term economic earthquake announces or even already represents: wanting to be affected by these also beyond this in the complete west and perhaps not only in the USA. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The crisis seems both in the states and in Europe to accelerate the events feared for a long time which take shape under these new conditions and come to the light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the outrageous renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The crisis indeed means a decline of the bank and finance institutions which close connections to the foreign countries have and an enormous set of the fortunes of private households which live in one single state manages at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means an immediate political problem for the governments: one enormous voter mass yes also representing which ones namely as it is necessary to behave opposite the families concerned. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So the crisis seems economically global, it is almost purely nationally political against this. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems to have advised to be and lost its talk right to himself so to the offside: The plausible evidence for it has been given by the EU which doesn't know how to find any common way due to its division in different national and international conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Everyone therefore expects the intervention of the state of one's own now; Rescue plans, new rules and V . are . distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis got graver and graver, merely the USA are an economic situation in it to save himself without strange help. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And furthermore they also have the identification besides the means to employ these: therefore two to not about judging prerequisites? otherwise to which ones will under certain circumstances?, be able no international organization and no market go back in a similar way well? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> That new stress which is put on the state national element is in a perfect harmony as for the rest with the bigger and bigger importance which is taken to connection recently with a sector put into the narrowest in the economy: the territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> More paradoxically it is way to have already just now when we were so convinced of it anyway entered a networked entire empire, to an empire of the always subtly differentiated technologies, the immaterial one that, suddenly, we must how our future will always depend on the essentially material things more anyway notice: Waters, harvest and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> All these can be transported by a place to the different one of the world certainly, however, are connected nevertheless on outermost piece paraphrased narrowly with one earth? a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The one who has such a territory therefore is, a different one, opposite, which lives in a harvest unproductive, waterless or free of oil deposits area in the advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I come now to the second novelty which, however, presupposes a short slide-in unit. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Government thus also tells Leadership who says politics whom territory, whom. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense seems the financial crisis to cause two converging phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand is there knowing respected Leaderships around the necessity therefore the need for somebody who knows how one regulates the things. </seg>
<seg id="22"> A wave of the indignation at the existing leaderships, V exists are on the other side . . now those the economy which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shade zones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Aspect sufficing more deeply a and worrying still in certain meaning finally joins: A confidence loss, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance which all of them focuses on a whole class of managers of the western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It seems so the conviction under large portions of the population to itself to clear the way that it isn't first the deeds of the social elite but already its idea world, her Way of Life, its culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary appears to be more foreign to the majority as always and come. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So the demand for Leadership nurses underground a branched but powerful movement of the deprivation of power of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective frame of mind of the last time: starting (and) perhaps the victory of the rightists also plays a role here in Italy with the advancement of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria about the collapse of the Labour party in Great Britain to for the rebellion of the American representative against Bush. </seg>
<seg id="26"> One gains the impression when is this one has an old elite, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectuals creditor, some still would say its format more and more, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value regarding this one, nowadays which goes in the lower social layers of the west in front of himself and of the financial crisis the √úberdimensionalit√§t and up to driven. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It would have time face all this one simply exaggeratedly, of a rebellion "of the masses." </seg>
<seg id="28"> Meanwhile, however, it for certain isn't to keep the eyes wide open. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Meetings to the old cinema Paradiso? the towns close their historical cinema halls </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historical cinemas close due to the favored Multiplexkinos. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "A town without cinema halls is a blind town, like a face without eyes." </seg>
<seg id="4"> What is happening in the big urban centers of Italy and also in the provinces at the moment describes this picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore with effect. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of the marking off of the cinemas which started with the birth of the big multi-hall complexes in the periphery means the death for the one hall cinema in the long run in the center. A process which doesn't only seem inevitable and irrevocable but also carries the trains of a cultural crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Concerned historical places full of memories usually shall, "it has to be lost like a friend with whom one has put a piece Strasse full of emotions back", so the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" which earned it Oskar and the large price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is to live the history of a suburb cinema and its nostalgia which consists of it in a cinema world lost for ever well. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The numbers deliver, the Anec, the central trade association which one speaks one considerably language: within the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas must have closed; the cinemas paid this check for the most part in the large towns: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Emilia - Romagnas belong to the regions most deeply concerned, resulted for the Lombardy with 41. by the tuscany with 44 and with 82 lost cinemas </seg>
<seg id="9"> This shows it that this one is main offenders the Multiplexkinos because these are just these three regions into which the largest number of these modern cinemas was registered: with 195 within the last 5 years leads the Lombardy the lists on, it is 81 both in the tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The business has so Paolo Protti the president of the Anec developed in an irrational way ", " it is useful that also new structures give up but the receipt is at first place the already existing because a hall closes in the town aren't all his regular customers ready to go to a Multiplexkino instead of the old person in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Eight and still the missing budget stays outerly for the meat juices of the trade association: the debts recorded by the state is approx. 10 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a disgrace of the ethical moral point of view that the government doesn't observe the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> To get the sector were between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of needs ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The case of Bologna, the first Italian town which has decided due to the worries about the old cinema halls to protect these by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, is interesting; it is the first agreement of this way to protect and to support the traditional cinemas in Italy which aims at it and this both in the historical center and in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Under the foreseen measures also tax Bevorteilungen are regarding the short-distance traffic for the cinema operators as well as advantages for the audience: it will be permitted to go to the traffic limited areas of the center and in addition to park at more reasonable parking fees. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "It is ", " a pleasant initiative so Giuseppe Tornatore, I hope that other towns will follow our example and draw up furthermore also new concepts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> We also need a better audio and video equipment, certainly however, to be able to take a message for the Multiplexs√§le against the superpower because the audience of today is finally more demanding. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the shutdown of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point which got me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" even if I had played with the thought for 10 years already. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in this one via Nazionale there where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn round aside to not have to see the dust covered posters. </seg>

<seg id="1"> If the energy arises from the waves, the great ones suddenly accumulate </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is a source of income not drying up, which covers more than 70% of the surface of the planet and the great seem this to energy companies of the world only now to understand. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Waves, flows and tides are the new renewable energy sources on these everyone looks now and tries also to occupy for giants like Chevron approximately. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The possibility of winning energy out of the movements of the sea is drawn and examined already for 70 years into consideration; these studies didn't intensify themselves considerably since the first earth oil crisis by chance. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the price of the oil at 1980 one broke in the idea of the sea energy gasify, the environmental organizations and the oil price increased are pressing for new impulses in this sector now, however. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The World Energy Council (WEC) in London guesses that 15% of the worldwide energy requirement could be covered by the energies produced by the ocean waves. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This would amount to the double of the energy produced by nuclear power stations at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, the flows and tides would there be in addition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Giants at the attack. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The first company which backs the sea energy now is Enersis which has signed a contract for the erection of a power station in the north of Portugal in the year 2005. </seg>
<seg id="11"> You published as this message seemed to be a revolutionary step. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is more and more companies from the traditional energy industry now two years later which put power generation on the navy. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Chevron examines these technologies"? so the spokesman of an enterprise known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal? and the possibility weighs up cooperating with us." </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is all about the obtaining of an admittance of the American energy commission which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is a sign to be not underestimated, V . . if one considers that are furthermore oil is extracted by the USA just in Alaska and president Bush recently got the plans going first for new drillings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The companies Verdant energy Inc. from New York and Ocean energy from New Jersey which invest in the new line of business also are besides Chevron; if the details aren't known either, then observers talk about an increasing interest anyway. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Still improvement worthy technologies. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Experts talk, about a technology still being in the departure this the last doubts not least, here aren't cleared on the part of the environmentalists yet. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Till now projects like that one are in Portugal and also Scotland of a rather small dimension and seem ecological problems to be taken seriously no to cause. </seg>
<seg id="20"> To produce energy in a great scale, however, it requires technologies greater influence on the environment far. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There are different possibilities: Energy approximately uses a system of buoys connected to each other Ocean. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The push of the waves, and which one becomes within the swimmers over pistons and top-hats into a hydraulic pressure, moved down, the buoys on changed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This drives a turbine which in turn operates a generator. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The current is sent to the coast on this over sub-water pipes. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Up till now there is four planned plant of this type, which only wait for the state approval. A part of the won energy could serve also for military facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Meanwhile, Verdant energy already produces energy for a goods department store and a park bib with the help of submarine turbines in the East River of New York. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The water movements during the tides drives the turbines, which eats the generator by the arising rotation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to the Verdant a long snake already services the necessary authorizations from possible clients to use these energy sources. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> First the waves, then the tides. </seg>
<seg id="30"> A special interest is earning the potential presently which is in the tides according to the institute for current extraction research. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Although it also is an irregular phenomenon the tides are predictable a more trustworthy current source better as wind flows, the solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore anyway. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is definitely the tides energy which federal states like New York, Main and Alaska as well as further coastal states got to invest already 7.5 million dollars in the year 2008? for 2009 up to 35 millions are already planned. </seg>
