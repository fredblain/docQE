Imitiert intelligent car the flight of the Hummel 
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to accident prevention, if not the obstacle to imitate sensors from the nature? 
For example, the bees. 
At the CEATEC Japan was presented a striking project, in which the Nissan engineers from Hummeln in creating new accident were inspired vermeidender systems. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University of Nissan has managed biomimetische system of car robotic humans type BR23C built a mini car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. 
In the air, each bee is their own oval "private sector," said our own "shield" is very similar to Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technologie-PR research and development of the exhibition. 
The composite eye of the bee that can see in every direction, and in a corner of more than 300 degrees, playing an important role. 
The function of the composite eye to imitate the researchers, the idea of the laser controlled distance diameter. 
This identified obstacles before the BR23C in an angle field of 180 degrees within 2 metres, calculated their distances and sends signals to the board Mikroprozessor, immediately avoided a collision process. 
The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by the tyre revolve around the corner. 
In contrast to previous systems will take place this purely instinctively maneuvers. 
"If it were not so, the car robots could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "mobility Laboratory (" and the Autoroboter-Projektes. 
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, because this technology to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a shift in the accidents still considered inevitable. 
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they avoid other bees. 
And in a split second. 
But can the branching out, in contrast to the bees, not upwards, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit the tyre. 
While the bees infinitely many options open in order to avoid other bees, researchers could only in car robot is the central movement, or of speeding up and Abbremsens. 
The BR23C Lithium-Polymerbatterien are easier and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. 
Andoh said it is on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of data, and even less to the ability to store them. 
This device must process per second only a few inputs and respond to them. 
It does not have to store or on the basis of previous exercises produce an intuitive, logical response, so that it constantly just a handful of KB Memory. 
There is no need for gigabits - and serious megabyte Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate Kollisionsvermeidungstechnologie, according to estimates by Nissan in the next ten years series will be in production. 
Another application could find the technology in the GPS-Satelliten navigation by the drivers aware of barriers around, and it leads to target.
