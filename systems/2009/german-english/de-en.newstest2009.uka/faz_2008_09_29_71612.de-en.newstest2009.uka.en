Düsseldorfer hope lies in Frankfurt 
The lack of big words in the letter to the board of WestLB not to the staff of the House. 
Through a combination of units of the Düsseldorfer money Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could emerge, " the central capital market House of " l financial group, " it says in the letter on Monday. 
The WestLB would provide a "competence bloc" with sustainable profitability in such a deal. 
And could be such a link the key impetus to further Bündelungen in the country's banking sector. 
It reads like a Board at a difficult time wants to demonstrate ability to act. 
Because the wounded WestLB remains under massive pressure. 
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for financial services regulation of North Rhine Westphalia country's government has only recently made clear to urge the time to find a sustainable solution. 
Of a sort of link between the Deka-Bank, " l know customers because of their investments fund and the WestLB is, however, for some time speech to Frankfurt. 
He has Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas during the presentation of the six-month figures at the end of August to know in a merger of the House in the Mainzer country road with a country Bank, for example, the Helaba or, see no sense. 
But the Board of the Deka, half of the country's banks and savings banks associations, instructed the board to lead with the WestLB talks on common business activities. 
It could go to the capital markets business or parts of it. 
The talks have said in the financial, only just begun. 
By the Deka-Bank matters with their 3000 staff, the more important employers on financial centre Frankfurt, is not the first time, when it comes to consolidation in the " l sector. 
In 2003 it looked for a moment as the Deka-Bank with the country's bank Rhénanie-Palatinat merge and Helaba. 
From this tripartite Confederation, however, was nothing. 
The plans were publicly the Hessische national government against a participation of Helaba in. 
The two other houses next, not each other. 
The country's bank Rhénanie-Palatinat was, instead, to the country Baden-Würtemberg Bank in Stuttgart. 
But it has repeatedly thought games on a link to the Deka-Bank with the country's banks. 
Recently, however, had Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba against plan games on a with his house. 
Regardless of but seems to mature the realization that a focus of the various houses of the public sector. 
Now, after the Land election in Bavaria is over, could begin a link the BayernLB with the Baden-Württemberg Bank closer. 
For the Helaba is not necessarily good news. 
Should increase the pressure on other mergers, go to her and the partners. 
In the south, it would be flowing junior partner, even though they were the financial crisis so far, far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A go with the West LB, in turn, has the cash savings and current Association Hesse Thuringia, with 85 percent involved in Helaba is the beginning of the year. 
If the North LB. 
Such geo-strategic considerations but are only one side. 
On the other there is the question of how different business models of individual houses suited to each other. 
In June, said Merl, the crucial question with which business model the future ability of the country's banks should be secured by the German savings banks - and current Association has not been answered. 
In the end, may also be a disassembly of West LB, but there is, of course, do not want one. 
Such is the letter of its board of directors of the speech, it would in any case, a "global solution" to the House. 
As with the individual units with the Deka-Bank can be accommodated, will show.
