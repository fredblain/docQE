Free - The orwellsche speech by Barrick gold 
In its spending on 17 September Le Devoir, published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Barrick gold mine gold. 
Confirms this, and a orwellsche logic, that the largest gold production society in the world a libel case about six million against three authors, and a small instrument By publishing house, with the aim of a " transparent public debate to open '. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge on the truth, especially in the case of smear complaints, but about the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference has been completely glossed over by Mr Garver. 
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, to ruin dares to represent one of the its opposite opinion. 
No matter how the process, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money in order to prepare their defense, and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight to be paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
The tactic is unequal battles in the rest of the often to ruining the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement, which makes the other side and also that discourages anyone who dares to look again at the issue. 
If Barrick gold really wanted to a public debate, she would present their point of view of things before the public opinion. 
By contrast, what works in many of the countries in which Barrick gold, is a matter of debate in Canada, usually through the exchange of ideas, and not by Kn√ºppelhiebe. 
So it would have been if the gold mine revealed their books and files have been opened, and a real debate, by the newspapers, the media, publishing and the financing of independent audit teams have light on that question. 
But Barrick gold seems to have confidence in public opinion and shut the petitions and letters of support for the Noir between authors of Canada with one hand movement. 
Maybe Mr Garver explain how he could ask at the same time, a "public" debate, but the views of these public? 
Apparently this word in the world of vice president, only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians ; a very nice beengte view of the term. 
In a democracy, even the detractors the right to speak. 
What does not understand Barrick gold - or don't want to understand - is that the general public, the authors and publishers supported by Noir between Canada, this is mostly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
The public is willing to listen and Barrick, to judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in a framework, which many as little publicity perceive complaint (in the course of the " public debate ' Barrick gold has just a requirement for the authors by Noir between Canada, in which it is asking them not to use this term more...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the complaint of Barrick Gold a direct attack on the freedom to academic research, and the truth are essential to any democratic society. 
It denies the right to quote credible sources, and to discuss facts and interpretations, which are the basis of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible in a country such as Canada, to explore issues and to discuss the rich companies not of this world, who else can this do then? 
If Barrick gold really wanted to be a public and transparent debate, it could lead by follows the scientific standards, which have been used by the authors of Noir between Canada. 
It has a right to respond. 
The university environment to which we belong to resolve has long known debates and disagreements to control and conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that they, in contrast to what they claim is in no mood for a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time that the governments to take measures the complaints this kind of unjustified.
