The first virtual providers are already this year, the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite sophisticated, the Czech providers offer virtually all of the services, as they are from their partners in Western Europe. 
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual providers, forcing the traditional at lower prices. 
Perhaps this will not be long in coming. 
That the Czech mobile phone operators to the most expensive work in Europe, we have often Mobil.cz reported. 
This, incidentally, also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which brought to our attention that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation roaming charges it is probably a paradoxical situation - for some customers, the Czech mobile providers SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home. 
How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe, are so high? 
The answer is simple, there is no competition, which really is a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical in the Czech Republic, there are three mobile networks and a Penetration by far more than 100 %. 
The mobile phone providers against grumble about the fact that it is very much at the Czech market competition. 
The often also approves of the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, often in the past, that there is no place in the Czech Republic for a further providers. 
It is likely that a classic providers with its own network no longer has very many opportunities (incidentally, he would probably be hard to find even frequencies). 
But there is still a way - a virtual providers. 
The entry of virtual providers in the mobile phone market brought a sharp price reduction, in which the traditional mobile phone operators had to respond. 
There were even before the entry of such companies such as Tesco, Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in the United Kingdom similar votes as in the Czech Republic. 
But it has shown that there is for such providers place and that they can really be successful. 
Incidentally, it does not take long to find examples. 
In February of this we have reported on the start of the virtual provider mobile King in Poland. 
In just half a year this providers to win more than 100 thousand customers and so for the five largest providers of the country. 
Behind mobile King is the financial group penta, which is in the Czech Republic, among other things, U: fon. 
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can on a much more specific target group. 
To be able to function effectively virtual providers need much less customers than a classic providers. 
They do not need a relatively high costs for construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world make the virtual providers usually the Low-Cost firms - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which will, however, often from a less extensive range of services. 
So, for example, provides Tesco Mobile in the United Kingdom SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of mobile shows King in Poland, it can also be quite a good move to bet on a cliché best target group. 
These providers is: specifically to men. 
"Real vote Kerle mobile King - the vendor they like and they can trust," David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile entertainment Company, the company this virtual provider. 
It's hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland in the Czech Republic take root. 
Doubts also press spokesman of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: " the Czech market is relatively small for a segment of the market, at the most virtual providers are based. 
He is also from the point of view of the relatively services saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic chancenlos, my mobile phone providers 
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile providers conquered the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile King. 
" While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but to see in the Czech Republic, the negotiations not very hopeful. 
There is more to a market of mobile King in other countries, our region, " says in a telephone conversation on Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the penta financial group. 
Indirectly, they confirmed that the existing mobile phone providers this idea in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything we can to ensure that no potential competitor. 
Their interest in a launch of a virtual mobile provider shows for some time the GTS Novera group that wants to take another step to be a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area firms customers. 
" We have an interest in going to offer our customers not only fixed - but also mobile telecommunications services. 
And the sooner, the better. 
About that possibility we have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile phone providers. 
With some of them, we were able to make progress in negotiations, " the press spokesman Pavel Kaidl group. 
Perhaps now better times. 
No official information reveals that the first virtual providers is perhaps by the end of the year to come. 
So far, but this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. 
" At this moment we are not in the Czech Republic, there is room for a full virtual providers. 
The Czech market compared to other major markets specifics. 
So far, has not yet entity, with a complex and raised serious project in this area, " says in his Mobil.cz Vlastimil explanation for Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
The nature of the Czech market other providers. 
The press T-Mobile spokesperson of Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement of O2 added: "so far we have not yet viable and on both sides favourable project found that it could continue to build". 
And it adds: " in the network of T-Mobile will appear by the end of the year, hardly a virtual providers. 
At this moment, we would already have a concrete offer, so that we can in the short term thinking. " 
Vodafone is its attention more to meet the demands of their own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav Čepický says: " for negotiations with potential virtual providers we are open, particularly in the field division of the costs and infrastructure. 
We see this from the perspective of the customer the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet. " 
The competent authorities, with the providers hand in hand 
The actions of the mobile phone operators is easy to understand, another providers would be more competition, this would lead to falling prices and a decline in profits. 
So why should such a competitors entering the market? 
That the providers can draw on the same side when it comes to anything, also the long to-ing and fro-ing to the emergence of U: fon. 
Probably the most powerful push in the direction of ČTÚ was at the time, when U: fon came on the market by society T-Mobile. 
The show also publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ-Webseiten. 
But now it is just U: fon as an argument for why we should not allow a virtual providers. 
Martina Kemrová said: " the competitive environment of the mobile phone market has been strengthened recently, also by entering the market a fourth mobile provider. 
Taking into account the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services high standards ". 
Given this approach, the mobile phone operators, however, surprised the absolute lack of Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is not just about the attitude of the ČTÚ in Czech unfortunately - in contrast to Britain and other advanced countries - does not have the authority to intervene in the economic competition. 
This alone has the power to protect the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
This but referred to his this whole issue very typical stance. 
" The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after it has come to a conclusion of the contract between a mobile providers and a virtual providers about the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
To date, there has been no such contract, because the supply of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional providers, " in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa by the Department of ÚOHS foreign relations. 
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a phrase. 
From a authority, which represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one misused his position in the market, this is more a matter of concern. 
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "abroad, where virtual providers is quite normal work to see that its market entry to a price reduction has contributed to mobile phone services." 
But probably belong to the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price cut to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
It is truly shocking in this case the almost touching line of the three mobile phone operators from their response. 
The question of whether or not it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. 
Just as the same gasoline prices at the petrol station, to make sure only by chance and the result is a hard competition. 
" The authority has discovered no evidence in this case, which suggest that the against the competition act, and thus she has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. 
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he has not increased responsibility for his actions in the market. 
The necessary tools for an opening of the mobile phone market for virtual lack suppliers also likely of the regulatory authority for telecommunications, " Chalupa led in his statement. 
The interpretation of a dominant position in the market is one of many controversial areas. 
There are, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÚ, after the telecommunications, from the point of view of the economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market has, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers a dominant position. 
Some legal experts but offer a different point of view - for entering the market of virtual provider is always needed the approval of the network operator. 
And the mobile phone providers - logically - for its network a monopoly. 
It means that in a certain segment is necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if but not with this reasoning refuses, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone operators remarkably similar. 
They show complaints a number of interested parties (including the society GTS Novera) that in negotiations with all the providers in very similar obstacles. 
Buck-passing is on the ČTÚ in the telecommunication services a fairly usually trick the ÚOHS distanced itself from the whole affair. 
This was in a number of similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it is not managed, in the recently passed amendment of the telecommunications law, the enlargement of the powers of the ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts from an improvement in the situation had promised. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS know only too well, but they probably have other interests. 
It is, when no one look 
Overlooked remains once the functioning of any pseudo virtual providers, of which there are in the Czech mobile networks several. 
There are companies that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services are only partly public. 
Usually it is firms operating in the area Multilevel-Marketing. 
Its own offer mobile phone services, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Star Life and others. 
The price lists of these firms normally only to select. 
The joke of the matter is that the firm against the operators than classical firms customer, a large amount of SIM cards. 
As an important customer receives it special price offers (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers a similar ban resale. 
"There should be cases you describe, then it can be a violation of the act contractual conditions, with which we are dealing, which could lead to a cessation of cooperation with the society," said Martina Kemrová on our question on this problem. 
But it is unlikely that such a thing with the leaders of the mobile phone operators is not around. 
Particularly in the case of the three firms mentioned it can act of thousands of customers. 
No operator resisted, however, that such an approach. 
Flowing from the activity of these firms them not inconsiderable profits, they are at the same time - in contrast to the actual virtual suppliers - will not be affected by the real official marketing. 
On makes possible problems Miroslav Čepický attention: " the law allows these types of speculation, in spite of everything, used the services of these firms have only a very small percentage of customers. 
They also have to accept that the SIM-Karte in her phone is not on their behalf, so they can't fully about as ordinary customers mobile providers. " 
Alone, but they ought to at least the ČTÚ strange. 
Also opened up a further question for the ÚOHS. 
Close the mobile providers before such an approach the eyes why they block a virtual providers? 
It is to add to that the ÚOHS detecting such activities has very strong powers, and if it does not want to ban, it must not be the statement of the providers, they know nothing of them and their business conditions would be satisfied. 
When the Czech Republic is no longer on the most expensive 
As the text has already been a number of occasions, the market virtual providers a sharp decline in price in the various services. 
Have virtually in all countries, where virtual providers are the traditional providers to try to prevent the emergence of virtually more or less. 
They used arguments were virtually identical - a too small, or too much gesättigter market, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
In advanced countries but picked up the regulatory agencies in these moments, which is by no means the interests of the mobile phone operators, but tried to maintain their customers. 
It was followed by formal or informal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operators, and this further. 
Unfortunately, the Czech throw the whole case, regulatory bodies like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience we cannot get rid of that lack of clarity in the competence in these cases, is more than good. 
But we do not throw in the towel. 
If the Czech mobile market background information and soon a virtual providers, will soon, perhaps moving again. 
If a supply the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, this will not stand idly by ÚOHS when it comes to discriminate against other interested parties to reject (). 
And the Czechs are finally no more phones more expensive than the rest of Europe.
