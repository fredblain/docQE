CSU: mercy on time 
At the end of October, will be decided on the fate of the fallen Duos Huber Beckstein 
Despite the election debacle on a plate once bore no heads, were at the top of the Bavarian CSU postponed the staff debates. 
Party chief Erwin Huber, and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this mercy. 
The fate of the tandems after the disastrous 17-prozentigen voting loss will be decided at the last October weekend at the extraordinary Party Congress. 
But the much gescholtene duo left already hints that it does not want to put on their bellies. 
They want to ensure that the angry group and appease the party base, a day after the "Bavarian tsunami", with the loss of the absolute majority demanded personal consequences. 
Five years ago, admittedly, under the leadership of his career the height Edmund Stoiber - reached the Christian Social Union 60.7 %. But now, a year after the coup against Stoiber they could only ensure 43.4 percentage of the vote. 
The CSU was 46 for years, "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, the 18 per cent of the German GDP. 
The Conservatives are the dominant force in the southern province of important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in the future in a coalition. 
The first sign of internal party will restructuring of the Hubers potential successor, Vice President and federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer also involved in the fact-finding team, which leads with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voters" exploratory talks about a possible Munich coalition. 
It is equally an irony of fate that with the list of "free voters" those Gabriele Pauli in the legislative, whose against Stoiber the incidence Huber Beckstein duo first exploited the abzuservieren determined politician mercilessly. 
Now the CSU-FÃ¼hrung focusing all its efforts on the stabilization Becksteins. 
In this transitional process will Stoiber, so far the strings from behind the scenes, an active part. The former prime minister and called CSU-Vorsitzender 28 September, the "most bitter day of his political career." 
On Monday, Huber, made a few toxic comments in the direction of the CDU, in his view, deserved the CSU far more support from the sister party. 
Others interpreted CSU-Politiker defeat as a signal to the CDU, and hence to Angela Merkel. 
The CSU, the 2005 national level much has contributed to the success, not with a common effort can back on its feet, Merkel after the federal elections in September 2009 will not again be Chancellor. 
Merkel from their disappointment at the fiasco has made no secret of the fact, believes that the loss of terrain of CSU will not have a negative effect on the grand coalition in Berlin. 
But what is relatively: the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats, however, is continuing. 
18,6 percentage with the SPD reached their so far, the best result in Bavaria since 1946.
