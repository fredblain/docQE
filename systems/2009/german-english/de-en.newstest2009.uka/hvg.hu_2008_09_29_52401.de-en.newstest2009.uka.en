In the wake of the more bizarre investigation received the 12 believers and atheists electric shocks while they studied a painting of the mother of God. 
As the results showed the believers were able to eliminate the bulk of the pain. 
Using a brain scan showed technology could even be shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of her brain, which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The study was the first in a research project as well as scientists also philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University to take part.

The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a picture of the mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato, in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin." 
The researchers had hoped that the sight of young wife Maria among believers, a kind of religious Trance would provoke while they identified Vincis picture, because it is hardly different from the other paintings and has been treated as reassuring. 
People spent a half an hour in a MRI scanners, and received in this period, a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should either the religious or the other paintings. 
Catholics reported they had at the sight of the mother of God "in security" felt as if they would be "surrounded by," and they would have felt "peace and quiet." 
During the Betrachtens of religious Gem√§ldes they have over 12 % reported less pain than if they Leonardos work had in mind. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, also attempt took part, said it could also similar effects with other strong acting images in the atheists, you would have to find just the photograph. 
"We must find a picture, which very positive sentiments, such as a mother or father," the psychologist.
