Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – cities are their historic cinemas 
The historic cinema close because of the beneficiary Multiplexkinos. 
"A city with no cinemas is a blind city, as a face with no eyes." 
This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect as now in the large urban centres of Italy, and in the provinces, is happening. 
The process of exclusion of cinema that began with the birth of the great Multisaalkomplexe in the periphery, in the long run, the death of the Einsaalkino in center. A process, not only seems inevitable and irreversibly, but also the traits of a cultural crime. 
Affected mostly historical sites full of memories, "it is like to lose a friend with a piece of streets full of emotion has come," the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" him 20 years ago the Oskar and the big prize at Cannes, and it is the story of a suburban theatres and nostalgia, which it is to live in a well for ever lost cinema world. 
The figures, which have Anec, the key industry association provides a clear language: in the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinema must close ; this bill paid for the most part, the cinema in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, in Turin, 6 and 5 in Palermo. 
The worst affected areas include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This indicates that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, for it is precisely these three regions in which registered the largest number of these modern cinema: there with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy lists, 81, both in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. 
" The business has evolved in an irrational manner, " Paolo Protti, the President of the Anec, " it is useful that new structures, but it is first and foremost the preservation of the already exist, because includes a room in the city are not all of his regular customers willing to pay, rather than the old one Multiplexkino in the periphery. 
And here is the lack of budget for the Fund's äußer industry associations: the recorded by the state debt burden is around 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace from an ethical and moral position that the government ignored the existing laws. 
In order to obtain the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year needed. " 
It is interesting to the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, because of fears that the old cinemas has decided to protect these through an agreement between the community and the Anec ; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional movie theatres, and both in the historic center and in the periphery. 
Among the imminence of the measures are also granting tax divisions for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the audience on the transportation: it will be allowed to drive in traffic from limited areas of the centre, and also to more favorable to park parking fees. 
" It is a good initiative, " Giuseppe Tornatore, " I hope that other cities will follow our example and, moreover, still new design concepts. 
To be sure, but we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to focus on the superpower of the Multiplexsäle, because, after all, the audience is more ambitious. 
The defense of the traditional cinema is for me has always been an important issue: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the tipping point me to create the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso," even if I have 10 years since had played with the idea. 
For 25 years, I live in Rome ; if I am on the Rialto or at the Quirinale, in the Via Nazionale, where I have lived through many different emotions, I try to the side so as not to see the dust covered posters.
