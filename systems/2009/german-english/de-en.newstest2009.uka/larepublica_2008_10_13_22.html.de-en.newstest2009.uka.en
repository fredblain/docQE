If the energy from the barrel of waves, suddenly the Great on 
It is a versiegende money source, which seem more than 70 % of the surface of the planet and it is only now that the big energy companies to understand the world. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources to which all now look forward, and also to occupy, as giants like Chevron. 
The possibility of winning energy from the movements of the sea, is already 70 years since taken into account and studied ; no coincidence that these studies stronger since the first oil crisis significantly. 
As the price of oil around 1980 vergas caved in to the idea of marine energy, but now push the environmental organisations and the increase in the price of oil to new momentum in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London, estimates that 15 % of the world's energy needs of the energy produced by the ocean waves could be covered. 
This would be the much honey now produced by nuclear power stations energy. 
Added the currents and sea. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first firm, which is now on the marine energy, Enersis, in 2005, a treaty for the construction of a power station in the north of Portugal has signed. 
When the news was published there seemed to be a revolutionary step. 
Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy industry, which for the marine energy. 
" Chevron examined these technologies " – as the spokesman of one of the corporate known American giants in the Wall Street Journal – and will be the opportunity to work with us ". 
This is the creation of a licence from the US Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is not to be underestimated as a sign of, particularly when you consider that continue in Alaska oil is encouraged by the United States and President Bush, more recently, the plans for new drilling in motion. 
In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant Power, Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey who invest in the new industry ; so, too, are not aware of the details, but observers from a rising interest. 
Still room for improvement in technologies. 
Experts speak of a still in the throes of departure technology, not least because not yet have the last doubts on the part of the environmentalists are resolved. 
So far, are projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland rather small dimension and seem to be no serious environmental problems. 
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, is using a system of related Bojen. 
The burst of the waves, which Bojen and moved, within the swimmer on Kolben and Zylinder transformed into hydraulischen pressure. 
This drives a Turbine, which in turn is pursuing a generator. 
The electricity is about Unterwasserleitungen sent to the coast. 
Until now, there are four planned facility of this kind, which only waiting for government approval. A part of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities. 
Verdant Power, however, already manufactures energy for a goods department and a Parklatz with the help unterseeischer turbines in the East River in New York. 
The water movements during the tides drives the turbines at what the central movement, leading to the generator. 
According to Verdant has been waiting a long queue of potential clients on the necessary Autorisierungen to make use of this energy sources. 
The waves, tides. 
Deserves a particular interest for now, according to the Institute for electricity generation research the potential, which is in the sea. 
Although it is an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, of solar radiation and the waves and, therefore, a more reliable source of power. 
It is precisely the tidal energy is what federal states such as New York, Maine, Alaska and other coastal states, already 7.5 millions of dollars to invest in 2008 – for 2009 are already planned up to 35 million.
