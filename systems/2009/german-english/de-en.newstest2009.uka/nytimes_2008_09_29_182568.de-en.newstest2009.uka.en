Obscure street in town to sell often forgotten and possibly soon 
New York City has thousands of main roads Alleen, roads and other ring roads, which some famous and others are only comfortable. 
Yet it is even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing local difficult to say where extra Place, simply because most have never heard of it. 
This tiny street is in the East Village and is from the First Street north between the Bowery and Second Avenue to achieve without the Second Street. 
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alleyway when, after a actively used transit route. 
There is also no road signs. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a Standard-Straßenplan. 
This road still has its admirer. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company, which has recently luxuriöse buildings on the First Street. 
It wants extra pflastern Place, in order to create a clean passage to the shops and Boutiquen in new buildings be expected. 
On the other Verehrern is the long-standing neighborhood, says she was fascinated by the short alleyway, simply because it is one of the vestiges of the past housing blocks. 
But the city government department, which is responsible for protection and the establishment of the residential buildings, and is responsible for the streets to preserve has no interest in them. 
During a meeting of the committee for use of the City Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay drew up a proposal for the purchase of the street by the construction company. 
However, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan, which is to be presented next month, Susan Stetzer, the responsible district on the town council 3. 
"Very little space is in possession of the city and we want to that extra continue to Place is one of the city," she said. 
"There could be bids, how to repair the streets and has engaged in what could be done by Avalon, but we also want the public access is guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago, the newly pflastern small streets and set up seats, among other things, are meant for a Café, would like to rent out the company. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the streets has been made public for the first time during the meeting this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but they do not have. 
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate the dilapidated alleyway, and to make a public meeting point," she said, and added that the city itself had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman said the department for buildings protection, indeed, it was the desire of the city, to sell the streets and stressed the role of the department that it is more likely to develop the real estate than to administer. 
Compared with its diverse neighborhood The Bowery, extra Place has maintained something of its historical impression. 
Some believe that the road to get her name in 1802 has divided than a large Farm, Philip Minthorne was among his numerous children and a close swath of land by any claims. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmals, which was closed in 2006, was opened to the extra Place, and the road is the most known as the scene of the photograph on the Cover of the days Albums "to Russia" of Ramones. 
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, the photograph had made in November 1976. 
The street was full of junk, Lumpen and parts of barrels, Postern, leaves and ropes. 
Some residents, einschliesslich the bloggers who write about the Gentrifizierung of the East Village, have rejected the idea of the sale of extra Place, arguing that this public land, however modest, as it is to remain publicly. 
Others have extra Place hailed as a rare – a virtually unchanged cluster of the city that should be left in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, the blog called ", his verschwindendes New York" (untertitelt with "the Book of complaints: a bitter nostalgischer look at the dying city"), has published a part of the conversation the city history extra Place, which was published in the journal "the New York" in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "extra Place is a small close impasse, even during the day remains dark and verrostete metal door, warehouses, closed windows and Regenrinnen is over flying weeks old newspapers marked". 
With few exceptions, the streets has so recently looked in one evening. 
A rat ran through the back part of the street, not far from the door, the earlier led to the CBGB, where today a more expensive clothes business. 
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground, not far from a fresh set of stuck with newspapers. 
Some shoppers said they had rarely thought about extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up. 
Fields, added that in his view, some people underestimate the attraction of the streets in their current state of affairs. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, was wet and disgust.
