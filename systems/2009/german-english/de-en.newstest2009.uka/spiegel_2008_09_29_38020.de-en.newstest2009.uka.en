Even rats have feelings 
A rat or a fleeing Schabe in danger this means that it also feels fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: much animals have feelings. 
Just how to check whether they feel the same if it is similar to how we behave? 
In the Internet magazine Edge " will be published for several years, contributions famous scientists. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series of selected answers to the question, "what do you think, without being able to demonstrate"? 
I believe that animals sentiments and others have awareness conditions without that I or anyone else could prove it so far, where we can't even prove that other human consciousness. 
In this case, but we must hope, at least, because all human brains are the same basic configuration. 
But once we turn to other species, and questions of sense or, more generally, raise awareness, we are entering impassable terrain, because the hardware is not true. 
If a rat is at risk, it is doing the same thing as many other animals: she is dead, retreats or attacks. 
People behave similarly, suggesting some scientists to conclude a comparable subjective experience. 
I do not believe, however. 
Two aspects of the brain structure make it hard to give our subjective experience on the animals. 
For one thing, the almost always on human consciousness associated circuits the roadside prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the short-term memory and the implementation / control functions). 
This broad region is in humans evolved much higher than in the rest of the primates and seems entirely on other creatures. 
At least for those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge to choose who we are, and the ability to plan and so there is reason to believe that the man even different from the other primates. 
Another dramatic nature may lie in the linguistic human nature: because so much of its Erlebens is associated with language, it is often the awareness links. 
In this case, it could exclude animals. 
But even if consciousness not by language, then this would certainly influence so that animal awareness, as it may be, probably the most of our awareness of Being unterschiede conditions. 
That is why it is difficult to determine how awareness may look for other animals. 
If it is something Internes and Subjektives, either measure because of the specific hardware analyze from our own experience, his research presents us with major problems. 
Most of my speeches are related to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of the awareness, scientific and be more easily accessible. 
You could examine the awareness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the case of visualize. 
But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick carrying more moved on the neural Korrelate of consciousness than the causal mechanism: both may be identical or not. 
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex to reach the visualize. 
What follows now for the sentiments? 
I put them back on an emotive system as the fear in one of his own conscious brain activity is activated. 
What we call a "fear", so is the mental state of affairs in which we find ourselves if the activity in the brain lokalisierten defence system (or whose consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. 
So the sentiments are intimately linked to the regions of the cortex, the primates, and especially the people. 
Coupled with the linguistic nature are fine graduations of it, because we can with the help of the words and grammar conditions and differentiate categorise them alongside ourselves also attributable to others. 
By contrast, for example, says Antonio Damasio that sentiments from low-level activities in the Körpergefühlsregionen of the cortex and the brain tribal emerge similar Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem. 
As this network in the course of human evolution have not changed much, it could well be involved in semi-generic overarching sentiments. 
Purely in theory, I could not disagree with me, but I think it is unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues, which appear in rats and people like fear, probably in two cases: but, as you can check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave in the same way? 
A fleeing Schabe in danger if they, too, feels fear? 
In my view, can prove just behavior similarity not yet Erlebens equality. 
The neurale helps comparison: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, Schaben, by contrast, is not even a brain. 
But the brain stem is responsible for feelings? 
And even if you could show for people: how to prove in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), have feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove it. 
And because their sentiments probably fundamentally from our different (since the human consciousness on specific levers circles, and is based on language), I would rather erforsche the emotional behavior than the emotional sentiments of rats. 
In any case, this is progress on the neural level, to the extent that in rats and people of the same. 
As I erforsche language and awareness in rats, not sentiments, but I do not know whether they exist. 
You may think this is short-sighted to run, but I would rather than constantly against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist.
