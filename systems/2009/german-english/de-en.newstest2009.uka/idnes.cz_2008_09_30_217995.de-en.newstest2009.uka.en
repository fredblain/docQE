Duel on a knife's edge: MP3 players on mobile phones. 
We advise you in your election 
While almost every mobile phone MP3-Dateien can take place, there can be no more phones MP3 player. 
So it is, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Even so, there are plenty of reasons why you should be a stand-alone player. 
The election all depends on the kind of use and the ambitions the future owner. 
Sure it is buying hard for home a splendid expensive record player to listen to the latest album from Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once such musical new seem not LPs and qualitative perspective, there is no objective reason for this. 
But you have LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, dream you probably at least one of them. 
So it is with the music on trips, with komprimierter music, simplified - music in MP3-Format. 
Here, too, there is price and quality categories. 
On the one hand, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kroner, but it will be a hard Pink-Floyd-Fan headphones for 20 kronor from the market. 
Two extremes between where there is for any room. 
The selection is diverse. 
Also the lifespan of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good Music player can take place a lot more than just music, but the mobile phones they create not even hints. 
No modern equipment is so universally, such as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, there can be music and videos, both of which, it has a better, a worse photo apparatus and perhaps can also navigate. 
And if the Smartphons and includes Kommunikatoren has almost a small computer in the bag. 
It is a minor miracle, because no refrigerator grillen and no television. 
But the universality of mobile phones also disadvantages. 
The more functions you use on your cell phone, the more often, however, you will need to nachladen. 
And the music is one of the largest energy omnivores. 
Only a few mobile phones music can longer than ten played 12 hours, mostly it is much less. 
In this respect, Music player (especially the simplest) much more efficient. 
So you should expect in the cheap mobile phones so that they can no longer than a few hours of music. 
If you then and still make a telephone call you buy prefer to safety a loading gear for the office, this also applies to more expensive equipment. 
You MP3-Playern will not have this problem, the less good hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a time Aufladen. 
Another problem is, if you want to papered over the music on mobile phones. 
Unfortunately, has only a small part of the equipment on a USB-Abschluss, moreover, not every mobile phone directly without special software on a PC. 
Of course, you can directly the music to a storage medium papered over, but only a few cards read equipment without reduction with the tiny memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. 
You Playern need to exceptions (iPod) no specific software. 
They need the machine only about USB-Port with music from your PC to feed. 
Most mobile phones and player even a music library, disorderly after the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the Genre or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some devices are only the tree structure of the catalogues, register Explorer, some, like the Windows can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon smart phones with operating system). 
Players are easier to use mobile phones more 
In the selection of a specific piece of equipment you should particularly after the lifespan of the Akkus, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of Klangs and, of course, the Bedien inquire of comfort. 
For music, above all, time and you hear it every day, only briefly, for example, in the trams, then any mobile phone, the MP3-Dateien. 
What really almost every mobile phone. 
They must also not very control what a mobile phone music formats can process or a player. 
MP3, all, and most of the music that you get in this format. 
The format is one of the most popular, and also the most equipment also music played in the WMA-Format. 
Less is customary AAC (a format that use Apple and its iPods). 
Better mobile phones also allow the purchase of online music. 
One need only on mobile Internet the side of a Providers (or any other provider to call), and you can buy a song or album. 
This service may be in for a sufficiently convincing argument for why one should a music phone. 
Unfortunately, the offer of bad providers and limited mostly only on quick radio Hits. 
Prices are not the lowest. 
In general, however, is that it is precisely this kind of sale of music (whether it be through GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in future will dominate the music industry. 
The mobile phone, the majority. 
If you have the inclination to listen to something you forgotten after the mobile phone in the detection equipment, while the players at home. 
There is, however, whether you always headphones, or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung in. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker on almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player. 
The biggest benefit of the music, mobile phones will be for many in the price. 
The cheapest typically cost less than three thousand kroner. 
For three and four thousand kroner get you a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap will be for the majority that are not normal headphones. 
The best and technically ausgereiftesten telephones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kroner. 
The advantage of the player, in turn, lies in the slight servicing. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the servicing with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the record player is obvious. 
There is no collision in the form of a mistaken salaried mobile Internet and then exorbitant bill for data transfers. 
What equipment should now 
Also the cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for austauschbare storage media (type M2, microSD u.ä.). 
Even if you are a karte nachkaufen, two thousand kroner. 
But respect. 
The basic models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive can also 8-GB-Speicherkarten read. 
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then you use after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) must then you no more than 1100 kronor on the table. 
You are one of the more ambitious Group's room, you prefer to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, a number of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have separate Bedien Knöpfe for MP3, and the Bedien comfort is the one MP3-Players. 
Most here is Sony Ericsson, the mobile phones from the series Walkman the same user interface as separately sold MP3 player. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long life span Akku (usually 15 hours, maximum of up to 35 hours) you MP3 players the aforementioned manufacturers.
