Olmert would almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace to return 
The chairman of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of practically all territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if we could, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria. 
He stressed that in an interview, which was on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot printed. 
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary, almost all (occupied) returning areas, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper. 
"We keep a percentage of these areas, but we are going to cede to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory), because there will be no peace without it," he added. 
He acknowledged that a possible return also would include East Jerusalem. 
"The person who, security in Jerusalem wants to and, above all, do not want tractors or bulldozers on a plate on his feet, as it happens, is one of my best friends, will have to forgo a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people are killed and dozens of people were injured. 
After words of the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "solution to the Tempelbern and sacred and historical sites," which are on the territory of the Old Town. 
" Those who want to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city, will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
It will not work, " he confirmed. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert spoke to Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which is, in his view, a condition for the signing of a peace treaty with Syria. 
This would but also some require effort on the part of Damascus. 
"My proposal is not with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights to make peace," Olmert reiterated. 
" The Syrians know only too well what they have to give back the Golan Heights. 
They are on their current relationship with the need to give Iran ; they are on their relationship with the (Shiite) must give Hezbollah movement ; they must renounce the constant support they give terrorism (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terror network Al-Khaida and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq, " the Prime Minister was set.
