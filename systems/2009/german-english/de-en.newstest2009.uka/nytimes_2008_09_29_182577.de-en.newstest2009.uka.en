The pride and the stress in the lives of the black population, in a city with the very particular kind of 
Tucked between the excesses of leisure parks within a radius of Orlando, a few miles from the glitzernden, noisy and gigantic activities, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of the Afro-amerikanischen culture. 
Eaton, the first entirely black city in the country, and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer so easy to describe how Hurston did in 1935, "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen 300 brown hide, 300 good Schwimmern, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Nowadays, it is a pilgrimage site. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eaton Ville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And yet is and remains the city – describes it, and it became a Touristenausflugsziel made by in the Florida trip leaders began to periods of depression by the Bundesschriftstellerprojekts produced – in many ways, a place of very particular kind. 
Eaton Ville is so independent, gediegen and privately how in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida are often refused to share their true thoughts with the weissen man "so little of us know that he does not know what he escapes." 
Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, calling for an open dialogue on race relations, there are many here remain to be Aussenseitern observed. 
"We are very careful as we are told," Hortense Jones, 59, from the moment of their birth, a resident of the city and community member of the oldest church of the city. 
It must be true. " 
Eaton) was for a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight. 
It is both an historic example of the black movement, as well as a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average. 
On the one hand, it is a stronghold of literature and on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes sentenced, sometimes much-vaunted - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that people here both proud and are wary. 
And so began the concerns by Eaton Ville's image with Zora, like all of us Hurston. 
It was the world their hometown in books by heart, and were written in Mundart, as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida trip leaders modified the city, which lies close to the route 77, a road by the oft-vergessene Florida center leads to the venues of black history and a human tragedy. 
An insolent as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston led readers mayor first to the Eatonvilles shop, Joe Clarke, and then turned privateren affairs. 
"The road to left," she wrote, "the tan - becomes angestrichene modern schools, with their leafy gardens and game seats, which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he can barely read and write." 
They also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "drinks sold of any kind, and was-auch-immer suits to hours rooms." 
In only a few hundred words brought Hurston so Eaton Ville with government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly not a trip leader. 
In fact, this was not a Portrait, which was appreciated by all. 
"Zora described the things as they were," the 90-jährige Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson verewigte girls the Hurston by quoted the men, the songs on their beauty sang, were full of sexual innuendo. 
They added: "some people liked it". 
We remember here still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin was regelmässig returned after their families after Jackson), Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that, if gebraust Hurston in the city, they usually did without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, held rauchend and trousers in a city that even today, something einbildet on their venerable dress style. 
According to Mr Franklin were the most of the residents of fascinated, whereas many of you despise. 
"The people have always glad to see Zora", said Mr Franklin. 
But it "never stayed too long," he added as he schaukelte in his chair, on a backward situated pavement cafés, the looks on the Sabelia sea, in all likelihood the Hurston was baptized. 
As Hurston died in 1960, it was very poor and abusing their books. 
Together with the much of the world Eaton), it seemed to have forgotten. 
Although it was once a famous author was a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920ern, they lived in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they buried in an unmarked grave. 
There was no major commemoration ceremony in Eaton, no public readings on a massive scale. 
"I do not think that they understood their contribution in the world, or their legacy in the slightest," can fit in Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston which was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy tabloid, the slow two-way main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs have already had the motorway through 4 of the Western city sidelines. 
The proposal was presented as Eaton Ville still recovered from a difficult period in its history. 
Forced integration, among other things, the relatively idyllic isolation of the community to an end. 
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing hatred in the community. 
"In this period was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the sidelines sitters people," Mr. Franklin said. 
" There was even a woman who was killed. 
They threw a water melon, out of the car. " 
In 1955, behind asked Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, the demand of the Supreme Court to force integration by its decision in the case of Brown against the Schulrat as "offensive respektierend instead of my race." 
Residents now say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positively in some respects, they weakened the groups cohesion in Eaton Ville and be aware of its young people. 
"Black children were used to being umarmt - and I remember this - we embraced his teachers in the morning, and one of his teachers embraced in the evening," N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and Managing Director of the non-profit group to protect the Eaton Ville community. 
That could be as long maintained, they added, until teachers and pupils no longer come from the same place. 
"You embraced its white teachers, for he was a white teachers - and I think there is a cultural gap," said Mrs Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights have helped that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created - black writers, actors and artists, the override prejudices, as they did, with a positive self-confidence and statements such as, " how can anyone to refuse the joy in my society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker on the path to Hurstons anonymous grave and began for the revival of their glory. 
Five years later was a much vowed to Hurston-Biographie by Robert E. Hemenway in the books to find shelves, and once again made it a part of the American Literaturkanons. 
Television road project just came at a time, in the most famous Eatonvilles daughter once again in the light of the public. 
And this time saw Hurstons old neighbors as Retterin. 
The community began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival in order to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the event opening two years later, and every January many returning for the ceremony. 
A few years later, the district from its road-building plans. 
"The plans a fünfspurigen top speed awoken highway crowded the city accelerated the whole thing with real proud citizens," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd put it a little easier, "Zora Eaton rescued Ville." 
The victory against the roads project has contributed to a change of image of the city. 
There were more and more Zugereiste, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer here since 1993 in the Church, and locals the past began to appreciate. 
Eaton) was introduced in 1998, in the nationwide historic register. 
A new einstöckige library (of course, named after Hurston) opened in 2006 at the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy tabloid. 
Today, Eaton Ville is still a feature in Florida: they only 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can sometimes anfühlen like a light alleyway in the summer rain, as small as it was then when it was founded only 27 black families in the 1880ern. 
(you nowadays is black to 90 %.) 
Outsiders in search of history Eatonvilles and its importance are often still be treated with caution. 
For most of the interviews is a licence in the run-up to necessary and certain things - as Wandbemalung eldest of Eatonvilles church which was painted by a Weissen and black men in the field of work - must not be photographed. 
Many in Eaton, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot still fear that their secretive community misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time, the greater the Hurston-Festival was born, was also a greater degree of home proud. 
Young people in particular tend to see Eaton Ville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and equally proud, creative, and hardworking, ridiculous and mixed as any other race - and international group in America. 
It is the genuine love for this town, you can hear the voice of Mr. Franklin with nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, the plan after the college after Eaton) to return to work in the city administration or in the police, according to him, could use a little help. 
And even the relatively young, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eaton Ville right. 
" Most people who are just here, think: " oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other, " said Alondra Kenon the other day a Sunday after the church. 
"But if you stop and for a moment of its history, it is a very beautiful city."
