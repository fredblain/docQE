A name for the sündteure child 
Is now the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar serious legislative rescue package, which will be in phases and on the purchase of bad loans from banks. 
In the first round will be half of the money spent. 
In a session, which ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, the congressmen after mehrtägigen debates to reach agreement on the 700-Milliarden-Dollar heavy rescue package, of course, Reuters reported. 
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President in the US Congress, and said the agreement only on paper. 
The compromise reached on the bailout backed both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the outcome: the programme will be effective and efficient, but we must do even more rumzureißen. According to Pelosi if it were not for the rescue of Wall Street, but the helm of the economy. 
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so Washington time Sunday evening 8.00 p.m. (Central European time Monday 2.00 a.m.), but has no high on the stock. 
On Monday, is the first house on the draft legislation to stabilize the economy in 2008, it is the Senate's turn. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress achieved during the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to protect our to stabilize markets and our economy, said Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the White House. 
The program, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, according to which the $ 700 billion in bad for the purchase, with contaminated credit securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche is to be spent a maximum of half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages, with 250 billion are immediately available, after the Congress as expected on Monday, will vote on the issue. This sum for the purchase of contaminated credit worse securities are spent, and the other $ 100 billion, should decide the President. 
The program will be reviewed by a own Commission, also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of Congress. 
In the spirit of the law the Treasury can also apply a combined tactics: it can at the same time, bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages purchased securities, or other "toxic" loans. 
As competent people reported the ministry can purchase in both auction, as well as directly. 
The law allows the affected firms in an insurance program, in which the Treasury guarantees the disturbing funds, and the company expected damage pay such fees. 
Henry Paulsen said: the law defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion dollars as emergency aid for the American financial system can be made available, it was worse for the large-scale purchase resources of their insurance, or to avoid a systemic risk, which is triggered by the collapse of a major money Institute. 
We take the necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared to introduce the legislation as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. 
The bosses of troubled and now reliant on government aid banks can, however, expect that their self-handling mentioned in the Übersee-Slang unceremoniously "golden hand shaking," will be shortened by the government. 
A reduction in the wages will only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury aushilft. 
The reduction basically means that if the Department obtains in an auction, the "golden hand shaking taxed" will be deported, unless the outgoing banking chief in the pensions. 
In the case of a direct buying the bad loans, the government will aggressively involved to ensure that managers salaries not be exaggerated. 
The picture also heard that the existing treaties Golden hand shaking not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements so that the more people to participate in the programme. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers salaries will be regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee measure. 
The state wins rights of participation in the participating banks, so that the risk of falls for taxpayers, because they can also join as soon as it is the economy, and with it the rescued Bank better. 
The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress over the next five years must submit a proposal, such as the taxpayers get back their lost money from the financial sector. 
There was, however, on both sides, skeptics who in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. 
This is not what the American people expect us to the plan to protect the taxpayers ' money by no means, the California Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said the measures were driven by the same people who are for the collapse of Wall Street.
