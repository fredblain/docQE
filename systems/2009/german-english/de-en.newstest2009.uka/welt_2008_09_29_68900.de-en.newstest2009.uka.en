Dark matter affecting air space probes 
For years, a mysteriöses phenomenon in Forschen for confusion: dark matter influenced the speed of space probes during so-called Swing-by-Manöver. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein's could not be quite right. 
Almost 18 years flying the space probe "Ulysses" through the space. 
Its because soon gefrierenden fuel pipelines now threatens the Kältetod. 
Under provides scientists for years mysteriöses phenomenon for confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie. 
The Swing-by is a flying maneuvers of space probes, which they added momentum in the Gravitationsfeld a sky body, around the world. 
The probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The European American research probe Cassini-Huygens used these physical trick, as well as the solar probe Ulysses. 
What the researchers, however, for years, surprise: the missiles are not totally, as one would expect from the ancient Gravitationsgesetz. 
Instead, it comes to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower. 
So far, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
It tauften Swing-by-Anomalie. 
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein's, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of the area, could not be quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton believes still firmly that Einstein was wrong, and tried to explain the Swing-by-Anomalie with the help of the so-called dark matter, the astronomers have identified in the universe. 
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be in the vicinity of the Earth," he writes. 
Aware of the existence of dark matter space researchers have only been around for some 10 years. 
It is obviously a appeal, whose effect on other heaven's body. 
They themselves on the other hand, is entirely invisible, that is, they will send and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists is the dark matter, after all, about a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
