" I welcomes the champion behind the stage, in order to maintain its character ', Günter Brauer,, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no Rüsche, no Kostüme for the entrance. 
The nature of the big Flamenco dancer who renounce the concentration and focus the interpretation in order to get a entspanntes appearance as a woman or a man. 
On the one hand, artists 
On the other hand, personality 
I am looking into private lives in these moments, which are alien for the audience, I know when I for the typical personality gesture, the depth of a stolen costs or Ausdrückstärke of hands are concerned because they do not enter the stage, can find. 
In his project " Flamenco people ' of the German photographer Günter Bauer Abwechselungs some rich drama typical of the sort of performance on the stage with singer, dancer and Gitarristen. From this side he was still little known for artists. 
With this proposal creates, photographer a special Ikonografie the Flamenco presentation at different levels. 
The exhibition, which is on the programme of the month the photograph of the Flamenco heard " reflects the international importance of Flamenco from day to day, ' says the artist, and makes it clear that " Flamenco people ' " any human being can be, but if you look at the photos, the spectator notes that there is no typical pictures of artists are at the scene. 
Ordinary people are on the portraits of artists, who are in the situation on the stage passion, sadness, happiness and to the audience. 
The personality of the artists to keep, you must not make photographs at the scene. 
Their personality and character is in their hearts. 
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere, which would allow me to stick with the photo camera the characters, the largest Flamenco masters '. 
Bauer, inspired by the festival, " Cante de Minas read ', in 1997, on a long journey to singer to photograph Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion the camera and the existing material created pictures recall classic photograph. 
The use of different stylistic destroyed means the traditional basis of the picture, the image of modernity and the idea of how the farmer Flamenco understands: " music with traditional roots, changed and surprised every day '. 
These are not only the dance, song, or Instrumental game in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, the audience with his art. 
The search for the essence, after a certain thing, which is presented in the form of the Hörens, of being visible is and was a firm target this work, which in the coming period in the gallery of the El Fotómata. 
Well-known figures in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente crony and others belong to the close selection of almost 70 artists, were photographed. 
The project has been a Anthologie of Flamencos, and will soon as book, with all the portraits from the exhibition. 
Bauer's passion to the portraits led him to take this idea two years ago, again and as "portraits of veterans of the sport to achieve ' (" SportART Project '). 
Although the concepts of the project "Flamenco people ' are different, the photograph to Count" it gives me great pleasure to photograph the people they know to learn and to enable state whose life, be it for a brief moment or a longer time. 
I think that in the area of the photograph is the portrait, the most difficult breed. 
You triffst or on individuals, individuals you sometimes not at all will be familiar with, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to make a photograph. 
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to achieve my ideas. 
The collection of portraits of the Flamencos today with the title " Flamenco people ' in the gallery of the El Fotómata issued in the street with the name la calle de la predominate and parallel to the street, la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition you can visit until 16 October.
