The psychology of the Überbietens - or why we are willing to pay more 
At an auction buyers tend to spend more, and to exaggerate the Feilgebotene. 
It is now managed Neuro-anatomists and economic researchers of the University of New York to discover the neurologisch-ökonomischen bases this known and seemingly irrational behavior. 
According to a published study in Science " magazine, want to give the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not beaten, and therefore are willing to pay even inflated prices. 
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological system this "game" with experimental auctions. 
A group of volunteers lottery should play, while the other action in a games, took part in both cases were active brain regions of the subjects functional magnetischer resonance (fMRI). 
In both games could win the participants money, however, it has been measured increased activity of the Striatum, a set of below the Gehirnrinde, losers of auction, in which the bidding of the opponent plays a major role. 
In addition to many other functions is this brain region for the "reward" of the nervous system. 
The researchers said the increase in prices could be by avoiding overreaction of the Striatums explain. 
In order to support their argument that economists have also studies in the group of researchers to Nachverfolgung of the money. 
In this case, three groups against a bid partners under different conditions. 
The control group was told the true value of the product, then they have their operations. 
Another group has been promised beyond 15 dollar reward in the case that as a winner out of the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which also were lost in the event of a lost game. 
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only that the emphasis in on the profits, while the other was on the losers. 
As evidence of the expressed Neuro-anatomists hypothesis, but the members of the "losers"'s group to higher operations prepared than those in the control - or the "profit" group. 
" These results are none of the previous economic theory. 
They have looked at auctions behavior so far, only with the joy of the profits or risk avoidance. 
The contradiction between these two theories was thanks to the neurological imaging techniques dissolved, so that we now have a third statement of Europe, " said Andrew Schotter, a professor of business law school of the University of New York.
