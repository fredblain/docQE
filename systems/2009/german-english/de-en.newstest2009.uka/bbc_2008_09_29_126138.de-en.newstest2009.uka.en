Housing companies see B costs striking 
British housing companies could following the rescue of Bradford and Bingley bank costs of more than 80 million pounds. 
The government said £ 14 billion available to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers. 
The interest rates on this loan will be paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 Baugesellschaften 
The Director General of the Association of housing companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unacceptable" that the companies would have to pay, and their members. 
The 14 billion loans will eventually be paid back when Bradford & Bingleys credits are eliminated. 
But in the meantime, accumulated interest rates each year, those included 700 financial companies accept payments. 
The program for compensation of financial services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing societies are included in that number. 
It is ironic that those institutions that behave prudently... now called upon to take some of the cost of those institutions that were far less wisely.

It said that every company in relation to the deposit that would keep would have to pay, and that the companies together around 18 % of the cost to pay. 
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan to 450 million pounds in 2009. 
This means that the companies £ 81 million for the need to raise interest rates in the first year. 
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Association of housing companies, told the BBC that he believe that this is unfair. 
It is ironic that those institutions that have been careful to behave during the real estate boom now called upon to bear some of the cost of those institutions that were far less wisely. 
According to the BSA has failed no society since the existence of the records in 1945. 
"We will all aspects of the issue over the next few weeks to see what alternatives exist to protect housing societies and their members may be considerable cost." 
Interest rates, due in 2009, cover the seven months of the end of September this year by the end of March. 
By the year 2010 there will be interest rates due for a full year and this could be nearly twice as much. 
Because Baugesellschaften mutual organisations are without shareholders will have to pay its members for the cost, either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
