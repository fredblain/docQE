Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of school at Tachibana High School is to imagine, the girls are beginning to kichern: Deutsche is totally "kawaii"! 
What does this mean? 
Sylvana knows the word from Mangas - in the new Austausch-Log told them from Japan. 
" The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before the Schulweg I had Bammel. 
I live on the edge Tokios toward Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School. 
The way I had to find alone, fortunately, I did not. 
The classroom seems to start at the Tachibana not as strict as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils trudeln from 8.00 a.m. until 20 a brief Besprechungs round nine starts with the teachers ' home room '. 
But before the study began to imagine that I was in the series. 
I am not the type who likes to speak before people, a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I have not had school uniform, I have an old rock attracted my host mother, blouse, blue Knies assets and black leather shoes. 
I lift, I have so the desk and try right: ' Sayonara where she Sylvana... ' - hot Sylvana, come from Germany, and in a week of birthday. 
At the moment, I was very happy that I had a little over two years, starting to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the classes have all getuschelt, sniggering and gewunken and all the time I heard the word "Kawaii." 
I knew that from my Mangas. 
It is important for the survival of Japanese vocabulary girls and means ' niedlich, sweet '. 
I am gehuscht quickly at my place. 
The girl has beside me fairly broad gegrinst, they thought it was an honour that the exchange schoolgirl should sit beside her. 
The rest of the day was fairly calm, but when the chorus Gong, I was bombarded. 
All talked and kicherten and I asked holes in the stomach - it is really difficult to understand Japanese English. 
In the break packten then all of their Bentos. 
My host mother had also made a lunchbox - that is something other than the tedious German breaks Brote. 
I had rice with herbs, small WÃ¼rstchen, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofu coat. 
Mostly, I have not got a clue what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
Things look strange and taste quite novel. 
What is clear is that everything is genuine lecker. 
Well, until the salzig imaginary plums perhaps brrrr! 
The Bentos are not only easy to Japanese schools, lunch. 
Sometimes it is that a girl a young pays a plate of Bento, which they herrichtet particularly art - in the hope of the young in the Pausensnack closer to know. 
I have read in my Manga-Comics. 
I 'm curious whether I can watch it here. 
' Why because very Japan? " my friend asked me, when I told them that I want to go for a year in Tokyo to school. 
I have always said. 
"Because it is, alas, fascinated." 
Finally, I read for years like Mangas. 
And I understand the comics, and the culture better, I have also begun at some point, a bit Japaneseness to learn. 
For me, was so clear that, at some point I had to travel here. 
Because I have a Faible for tradition and customs. 
And on this great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - it is strictly on the other hand, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organised, I have also not yet lost felt, even if Tokyo is the greatest city I have ever seen. "
