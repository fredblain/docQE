Obama – the first anti-American President? A statement 
A well-known American politicians, are seen as independent, wrote: " Barack Obama will be the second anti American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, the dezimierte by his decisions, the economy of the United States and the befeindeten Islam relations with the used (and still does today as a private citizen. " 
The attacks on Obama are increasingly intense, especially now, where the approaching elections. 
A lady from Miami wrote in a website: " this person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is very brazenly: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation, which has a total of two black governors and five black senators seen! ". 
They have these attacks but not a great deal to say ; it is racist attacks and not answer the question of the voters: he will be a good President? And then there is also the polls ; all say that Obama will win by a large margin. 
In this case, people are there, with the heart and not talk to the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in the editorial: it was only in the election booth we will know who the real American patriot will be his voice. 
This is a mentality of the United States, which has been up to least hidden. 
Says, "what do you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether Obama or McCain." 
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will move out of America. 
Something you never before heard – only now, when the success of the black candidate seems so sure. 
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people were asked: what mistakes, Bush has committed during his time in office? 89 % have replied: the war in Iraq. 
America is changing. 
The nation lost 50000 troops in Vietnam and was a kick in the pants sent back. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to. 
Still, Iraq remains for the majority of weak point of Bush. 
The person who will take his place, faces a huge task.
