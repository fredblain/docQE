For the Olympic Games are the streets in Madrid. 
Yes, the dream is that many of us to organise some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be but perhaps 2016. 
But I wonder: " we are prepared for this? ' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true! 
It has been described as a perfect street and, in my judgment, it was the worst road with all the wiser and off it. 
Of course, that is a lot of nonsense if you would pay attention to assessment and I could see what would clearly not. 
But, from the outset, we all. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket to get to you allowed to go, as the first. 
It seems to me, too, should not be a bad thing, but if you do, then they give you everything (including chip, in order to avoid the congestion on the road). 
Not yet. 
They let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is the only reason to go) and (after a never-ending waiting lists) because the surprise is, the T-Shirt, there were only in the size of the "s" (a second nonsense because I need the size XL) 
Where we live? 
Or is it the case that was decided after the crisis only small, much cheaper to buy shirts from less stuff? 
Well, things like this are a small beer compared with the days on the street. 
Apart from the fact that you have very early to go to the chip, there is already a waiting lists of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you must let schoolbag. 
The wait has taken more than 35 minutes, which are expected in the case of a street, where 11 36000 people, is incomprehensible. 
After all, as it was to be expected, began the streets and we have had our back bags not leave, even if it was once managed to recover, but they would be more difficult. 
It also saw in those waiting 40 minutes by rain, so it was tempting to organize a popular uprising and attacked the excited. 
I think this morning, to be sure, some 500 people have pneumonia and some as I can, because this chip, which I received, not even in time the classification, I think that the outcome was wrong. 
Of course, if you ask me, after a perfect street would this road would never improve. 
So I think we are still a long dream of a city, which is well prepared for the Olympic Games
