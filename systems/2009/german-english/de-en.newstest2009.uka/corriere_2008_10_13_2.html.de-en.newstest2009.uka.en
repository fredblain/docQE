The economic Nobel Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. 
Of the 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, who teaches at the University of Princeton and known for his regular article for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the economic and foreign policies of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, while the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman in an editorial in the New York Times claims that this second event was crucial for the history of the United States as the attacks. 
A predictive not received little controversy in response and the economists still years later was accused today but as turns out to be entirely correct. 
"I am surprised and shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals within the framework of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom, disappeared from the public to the fore," Krugman declared the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the executive committee of the European Central Bank Krugman is a "economist of great value," but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
