Debate about bilingual education: education in English language environment 
In this edition of the ' Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and discuss lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and a senior director in the specialist education Sciences of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book, "not as good as you think: why the middle class needs a school choice." 
To address the Hispanic voters is a complex task. 
Barrack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a case in point. 
Obama's campaign said a successful conclusion, "the likely afro-amerikanischen and Hispanic students, the school is lower than in white pupils" - what is true. 
In order to close this performance, recommends that Obama's education plan specifically among other bilingual transition in training for those who learn English. 
Still, there is the question to Obama, whether its use for the bilingual education places the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest to reduce the gap in the education services. 
Let us take the example of "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of the students are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of which are only recently in the country to learn English. 
Yet in 2008, stunning 100 per cent pupils the fourth class the state math exam in insisting on a good level. 
Also surprising 93 per cent of children from the fourth school year in the English test as well. 
This astonishing success has been achieved with other methods than those who favors Obama. 
The Sixth Street school places its focus to review and exercise, on the slow, steady control knowledge and an attitude which tolerates no exceptions. 
Furthermore, the school, the approach after training in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly the point that Obama is to be noted, the school head Linda Mikels. 
This approach attaches to the almost ausschlies southern use of the English language in the specialist teaching. 
Mrs Mikels, rejects the idea of bilingual education, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a student, was on the verge of from Mexico. 12 months later would enter the class space and it can no longer see again. 
"It works," she said, "it works for us." 
Obama would be a school as the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other students learning English? 
The performance of the school that would easily make the answer to that question, but the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support has long been the idea of bilingual education), and his own unstinting support for the bilingual education to make predictions about Obama's uncertain reply. 
While he agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently the subject of trivialised by noted that people should stop worry about on "only English" document legislation. 
Instead, he said: "they should make sure that your child Spanish". 
When Obama, in fact, the performance gap wants to close, they should carefully consider education models to trivialise the work, rather than to despise.
