The Sudeten demanded a referendum by the US 
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had requested the incorporation of the Böhmerwaldes to the United States. 
This is from a letter, which is in the collections of the Südböhmischen scientific library. 
If we can be part of Germany and Austria, so we want to at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire to 1945, a few groups of Sudeten Germans have turned to the president of the United States. 
This is, among other things, a letter, which has remained in a private archive and in the collections of the scientific Südböhmischen kept library. 
The Germans of Krumau ask in the letter the American president, he would not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler was taken over - to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have correctly understood the situation, and we really want to enter the words to be sure that the American units not oppressors and enemies German territory, but as liberators," it says in a letter, with the words "people, which is the fate of the Sudeten on herzen" is signed. 
Since the aftermath of Czechoslovakia the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - suggests that they expect brutality, reckless, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery would ask the author of the letter to the American president, for today and forever on the protection to rule on the Böhmerwald. 
"We can't believe that you without regard to the view that a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area for us foreign state, oppressed minorities and trying to eliminate and absolutely nothing has contributed to the victory for the Allies," read the letter. 
The reason why the authors can't sign is supposedly fear revenge cut-price "Czech oppressors." 
If the US president doubts as to the ethos of the German Böhmerwald have, whether it be sufficient, if he initiate would Böhmerwaldgau a referendum on whether the inhabitants are part of the United States or wanted to live under the protection of domination of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the post-war history may sound a little naïve, but he considers some time witnesses a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to at least anticipated that we would be negotiating over their deportation from the Republic, few of them such a possibility at all. 
Some waited for the United States and Britain for the Sudeten would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Still others believed they could stay in Czechoslovakia. 
The also confirmed the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa from Budweis. 
It was used in the war as a Budweiser German in the navy in the Baltic Sea. 
When he came at the end of the war in British captivity and placed him in a prisoner of war camp after Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans to him that he should teach them Czech. 
"They believed when they come home, they would be adding the Czech to come," Chalupa. 
No one of the German prisoners of war, lived prior to the war in Czechoslovakia had been expected, in his view, that he would be on the basis of Beneš-Dekrete from the Republic.
