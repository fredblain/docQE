<seg id="1"> Duell on a knife edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We advised you for your choice </seg>
<seg id="3"> While nearly every mobile phone mp3-dateien playing, may still not use MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It so we, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Despite everything, there is plenty of reasons why you should go a stand-alone player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The election depends on the kind of the use and the demands of the future owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is difficult for me to buy the safe at home a splendid expensive music players, in order to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc hearing. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Even appear on this musical substance not lps, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, they have lps with kind of rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, dream you probably at least by this. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is with the music on travel, with komprimierter music - music in the simple mp3-format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here too there is price and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For one, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kronor in the same way, but a pink-floyd-fan headset would be very difficult to cope with the market for twenty crowns. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Between those two extremes, there is plenty of room for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The range is wide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The lifetime of the batteries is crucial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good Music player can happen much more than just music phones, but what can you do not even tacitly. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern equipment is to use as universal as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the Simsen, it can reflect both music and videos include a better, it is time to have a worse Fotoapparat and can perhaps also navigate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if you add the Smartphons Kommunikatoren, and it was almost a small computer in the pocket. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a minor miracle, because no fridge can complain and no television fotografieren. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of mobile phones will also have its disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more functions on her mobile phone use it, the more often, however, it must be nachladen. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the playing of music is one of the largest energy savings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Mobile phones can only a few hours longer than zehn-zwölf music playing, mostly it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this regard Music player (especially the easiest) clearly more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> You should therefore expect cheap mobile phones that they no longer than a few hours of music playing. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If it is still a telephone call from and about the safety they prefer to buy a Ladegerät for office - which also applies to more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> On MP3 players, you will not have this problem, also keep the less good at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a time loading. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem, then, if you had bought the music on mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Regrettably, only a small part of the equipment on a usb-abschluss, moreover, not every mobile phone without special software on a PC directly. </seg>
<seg id="31"> We cannot, of course, the music directly on a storage medium had bought tickets, but only a few readers without reduction with the tiny is ready, the memory cards used in mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> In players they need up to exceptions (iPod) no special software. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need the machine only on usb-port with music to feed from your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile phones and player of a place Musikbibliothek, in an orderly manner after the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices are only the Baumstruktur of the address register, like the windows, some of them both (Explorer, Sony, Samsung, iriver Cowon, smart phones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Player, it is easier to use mobile phones could have more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the selection of a specific equipment, they should be especially after the lifespan of batteries, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of Klangs and, of course, also to inquire about bedien comfort. </seg>
<seg id="38"> As their music above all aid and you hear every day, for example, in the tram briefly, then a given enough mobiles, the mp3-dateien scenes. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What really almost every mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They must also not very monitor what Musikformate a mobile or a player can process. </seg>
<seg id="41"> All MP3 create, and most of the music they will just get in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format is one of the most widespread, and most of the equipment also wma-format music in the place. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Less usual AAC (a format that use apple and its iPods). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better mobile phones will also be buying music online. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It just needs on mobile Internet the relevant sides of a providers (or any other provider), and you can buy a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service in themselves can be a clincher for why they should lay Musikhandy. </seg>
<seg id="47"> It is unfortunate that the offer the service providers badly and confined mostly only on rapid Radiohits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are not the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In general but the assumption is that it is precisely this kind of the sale of music (be it on GSM, internet or wireless Internet) dominate the music industry in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> The mobile phone, most in itself. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If they all want to listen to something, they resort to the mobile phone in the Jackentasche, while the player at home is forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="52"> However, it is important whether they are always headphones, or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung in their account. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeakers, on almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 players. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Probably the greatest advantage of Musikhandys is for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three and four thousand kronor you will get a very decent Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest drawback for the majority will be that no normal headphones are involved. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and technically ausgereiftesten phones for ordinary headphones with a 3,5-mm-öffnung cost up to fifteen thousand kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The benefit of the player is, once again, in the light operation. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of functions, the similarity in the operation with the early normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the record players is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> It is not interfering in the form of a mistake employees mobile Internet and then horrendous bill for data transfers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> What equipment should now be single </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527), usually on a Slot for memory austauschbare microsd (type m2, media, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if the card nachkaufen, two thousand kronor. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But respect. </seg>
<seg id="67"> In the normally only be Basismodellen cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive can also read 8-gb-speicherkarten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If they already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then, after they resort, Cowon Creativ Emgeton or Sony, Samsung, iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> According to capacity (Max. 2 GB) then they should not more than 1100 kronor on the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> This is one of the more demanding Hörern, they would prefer specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). </seg>
<seg id="72"> These machines have independent bedien knöpfe for MP3, and bedien comfort is so on the one mp3-players. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Most here is Sony Ericsson, which Walkman phones from the series of the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually. </seg>
<seg id="74"> The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with a greater storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long akku-lebensdauer (usually 15 hours, a maximum of up to 35 hours) you make MP3 players of the above manufacturers. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual providers is already in this year after the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite perfect, the Czech providers offer virtually all services as their counterparts in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, something is missing here - a virtual service providers, the forces the classic at lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps this will not be long in coming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Czech mobile phone suppliers to the highest in Europe at all work, we have also often reported at mobile. Cz. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It also confirmed the telecommunications authority tú, the attention that the price of a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After recent moves by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, it is probably to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators will be cheaper SMS from abroad than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How is it that prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe are so high? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a declaration of war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic, there are three network and a Penetration of far more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile phone providers like against grumbling about the fact that it very much on the Czech market competition. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The agrees with often the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (tú) by Pavel dvoák, often in the past, said that it had no place in the Czech Republic for another provider. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is likely that a classic with a own network providers not so many opportunities (incidentally, he would probably find little of frequencies). </seg>
<seg id="15"> But there is still a possibility - a virtual providers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The entry of virtual providers on the mobile market brought a strong price reduction, in which the traditional mobile phone operators had to respond. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There was even before the advent of such companies such as Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile on the market in the United Kingdom similar votes as in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, it turns out that there is a place for such providers and that they can really be successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Not long after, by the way, you need to seek examples. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February that we have on the start of the virtual operator reported Mobilking in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In just half a year, this providers, more than 100 thousand customers and so on to win fünfgrößten providers in the country levels. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is behind Mobilking Penta, the financial group in the Czech Republic, among other things, U: fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual providers is that we focus on a much more specific target group. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to be able to function effectively virtual providers need much less customers: as a classic providers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They need no relatively high cost of construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world as protectors normally the virtual operators as low-cost- firms on the other, they offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS, although often of a less extensive service. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> That is, for example, Tesco mobile in the United Kingdom SMS at least half to cheaper than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move, in a not klischeehafte target group. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This providers: specifically directed to men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "real Kerle Mobilking - the providers, choose who you like and they can trust", so David Seibert, the chief executive of the mobile entertainment company, the company this virtual prey. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Hard to tell whether a similar plan in Poland also could get a foothold in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Doubts the press spokesman of Vodafone Miroslav epický: "the Czech market is for a market share, in the most virtual operators based on relatively small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> He is also in the view of the services offer relatively saturated. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic, the mobile phone operators, not my </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile phone operators, this is not Mobilking conquered the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We talk about an expansion of this successful project in the Czech Republic, but the negotiations are not very hopeful. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It is more likely to produce a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region ", says in a phone call for mobile. Cz, press spokeswoman Jana studniková Penta, the financial group. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly confirmed it so that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are not well disposed towards this idea. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The opposite, they are attempting to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Their interest in a start of a virtual mobile phone operator already shows the group for some time, Novera gts would like to do the one step further, to a real competitor by Telefónica O2 customers in the area firms. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have a great interest in our customers not only both fixed, but also mobile telephone telecommunications service providers. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the sooner the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> We have repeatedly about that possibility negotiated with all the Czech mobile operators. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them, we were able to achieve progress in the negotiations ", so the press spokesman for the group by Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps now come better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> From not official information suggests that the first virtual operators by the end of the year, perhaps, is to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="47"> So far, but this is an insurmountable wall of silence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "at the moment, we do not imagine that in the Czech Republic square for a full-fledged virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market compared to other markets has great specifics. </seg>
<seg id="50"> So far, we still have no subject with a complex and serious project in this area, "says said in its statement for mobile. Cz Vlastimil LRRD from the press department of Telefónica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> On the nature of the Czech market also reject other providers. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press spokeswoman of presenting historian Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement by O2 added: "so far we have no viable and mutually advantageous project, found on which one could continue to build." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And it adds: "in the network of presenting until the end of the year is hardly a virtual providers appear. </seg>
<seg id="54"> In this moment, we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think at such short notice. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone is his attention more to comply with the requirements of the own 3g-lizenz. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav epický thinks this: "for negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the field division of cost and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> This is exactly what we see in the view of the customers as the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in search of a partner in the development of a shared network for a rapid mobile Internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities, hand in hand with the providers </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The actions of the mobile phone operators is easy to understand another provider more competition, this would mean to lower prices and will also lead to a decline in profits. </seg>
<seg id="61"> So why one should make it easier for such competitors from entering the market? </seg>
<seg id="62"> The providers can pull together when it comes to something is also shown by the long bounced back and forth about the generation of U: fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of tú was at the time, as U: fon came on the market for presenting, by society. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It also confirm the publicly accessible information from the tú-webseiten. </seg>
<seg id="65"> But is just now U: fon as an argument why we should not allow a virtual operators. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Historian Martina Kemrová said: "the competition environment of the mobile telephony market was also recently by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider. </seg>
<seg id="67"> In light of the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is evident that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services would be tough demands. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> In light of this approach of the mobile phone operators, however, surprised by the absolute indifference of the Czech regulatory authorities. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is the attitude of the tú in Czech, sadly, in contrast to Britain and other developed countries - not is competent to intervene in the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This is solely the Office for the protection of the economic competition (úohs). </seg>
<seg id="71"> This but referred to this issue as a whole, its very typical attitude. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after it to a contract between a mobile phone operators and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> No such Treaty has so far been closed, as the supply of potential stakeholders for the traditional operators probably was not sufficiently interesting ", so in his response to our request by the Department Kristián Chalupa úohs foreign relations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> By representatives of the supplier would not be surprised by such a formulation. </seg>
<seg id="75"> From one office to represent the interests of the consumer, among other things, to ensure that no one is abused his position in the market, this is more than worrying. </seg>
<seg id="76"> In particular, adding: "If Kristián Chalupa abroad, where virtual operators work quite normal to see their market entry to a price cuts for mobile telephone services has helped." </seg>
<seg id="77"> But are probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction not with the interests of the úohs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> Really shocking is in this case the almost touching line of the three mobile phone operators, based on their reactions. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question of whether it was a coincidence, is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="80"> As well as the absolutely same price for petrol stations certainly only by chance and the result of a tough competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "the authority has discovered no evidence on this issue, for a resolute action against the competition, and therefore suggest that it has no reason, in any way, to intervene in the matter. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the providers has a dominant market position, so it has also not conducting increased responsibility for his actions on the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The instruments necessary for the opening up of the mobile phone market for virtual providers lack probably also the regulatory authority for telecommunications, led Chalupa in his statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> There are, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drafted by the tú, after the telecommunications, from the point of view of economic competition a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> On such a market has, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators holds a dominating position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Some legal experts, however, offer a different perspective - for access to the market of a virtual supplier has always required the approval of the devised. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile phone providers - logically - for his network the monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> The means that they are in a certain segment will require a dominant position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if it refuses to play ball with this argument but not for the úohs, it should be a warning that at least three mobile phone operators strikingly similar approach. </seg>
<seg id="91"> This show complaints of a number of interested parties (including the society Novera gts) that they are in negotiations with all providers on very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Buck-passing in the tú is in the telecommunications services a right of common trick with the úohs to distance itself from the whole affair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> It was already in a number of similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> It is, unfortunately, not achieved in the recently reviewing of the telecommunications law adopted the enlargement of the powers of the tú on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts from promised an improvement in the situation. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The, the representatives of úohs know only too well, but you have probably other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It is already, if nobody watching </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Unappreciated, once the functioning of any pseudo virtual operators, of which there in the Czech mobile networks equal several. </seg>
<seg id="98"> There are companies which own price lists for mobile telecom services, but they spend only partly made public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Normally is, after all, the companies that operate in the area of multilevel-marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Offer their own mobile telephone services, for example, Amway Starlife Bohemia, telecom and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price lists of these companies usually only reach to select. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter is that the firm towards the operator as classic Firmenkunde appearance, a lot of SIM cards. </seg>
<seg id="103"> He then as important customer receives special offers of prices (and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators continue to sell a similar ban. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "If there are some cases which describe them, then it is a violation of contractual conditions, which we will deal, which put an end to the cooperation with the relevant society," said historian Martina Kemrová to our question on this issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> However, it is unlikely that something with the leaders of the mobile phone operators not gets about. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Particularly in the case of the three mentioned companies can act to thousands of customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator, however, is opposed to such an approach. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Flow from the work of these companies that they are not negligible gains, you will at the same time - in contrast to the real virtual suppliers - not by the real official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> On possible problems Miroslav epický closely: "the law allows these types of speculation, despite all the services provided by the firms are only a very small percentage of customers use. </seg>
<seg id="111"> This must also accept that the sim-karte in their telephone not on their behalf, so you can have not used as the normal customer of the mobile phone providers. " </seg>
<seg id="112"> The alone, however, the tú at least strange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> Also gives another question for the úohs. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The mobile phone operators shut their eyes before such an approach, why do you lock themselves against a virtual providers? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is to add that the úohs to uncover such activities have fairly strong powers, and if they do not want, it must, not with the declaration of providers that they knew nothing about it and its business conditions would be content to forbid it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When the Czech Republic is no longer in the most expensive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As the text said on a number of occasions, the market entry was a sharp price drop virtual operators in the various services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> They have practically in all countries, where virtual operators were created, the traditional providers, which is trying to prevent virtually, more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> You practically identical arguments were used - is too small, or very gesättigter market, problems in the quality of services, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In the highly developed countries in these moments but blew the regulatory bodies, which is far from the interests of the mobile service providers, but the their customers tried to maintain. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Either by formal measures or not formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by further. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately raise the Czech regulatory bodies to the whole event, like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Based on our experience we can not help rid that ambiguity in the powers in these cases is more than favourable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> But let us not give up so easily. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background information is correct and soon a virtual providers, will the Czech mobile market moving again soon, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual mobile phone provider, it will not remain inactive, úohs when it comes to reject other interested parties (to discriminate against them). </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs will no longer use more expensive than the rest of Europe. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Düsseldorfer hopes to Frankfurt </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In big words are lacking in the letter of the westlb- board of directors to the staff of the House. </seg>
<seg id="3"> By bringing together units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstituts with the Frankfurt could deka-bank Sparkassen- Kapitalmarkthaus "at the heart of the financial group", it says in the letter reported on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The WestLB Kompetenzblock would result in a '' with sustainable profitability in such a deal. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And could such a link the decisive push to further Bündelungen banking sector in the country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> If so, it is more difficult time a board wants to demonstrate ability to act. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for financial services supervision, the national government of Westphalia nordrhein- has made it clear recently that the time is pushing to find a solution for the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> As sort of a link between the deka-bank, the savings for their clients, and the WestLB Investmentsfonds know for some time, however, is already the speech, also at Frankfurt side. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although deka-bank-chef Franz Waas during the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, know that in a merger of the House to the highway with a Landesbank Mainzer, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he see no sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But the Board of the Deka, the ever at half of the country, banks and savings banks associations, the board, charged with the WestLB talks on joint business activities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Yet it would order marktgeschäft and parts of the capital. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The talks have, of course, it has only just begun on financial centre. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The deka-bank who, with their 3,000 staff, one of the most important employers in the city of Frankfurt, is not the first time, the speech, when it comes to consolidation in the savings banks sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2003 it for a moment as possible with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz deka-bank and merging the Helaba. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This is Dreierbund, however, it was nothing. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hardly had the plans has become public, the Hessische provincial government against the participation of Helaba point. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The two other homes were not each other. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But it has repeatedly thought about a combination of deka-bank with regional banks. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Most recently, however, Günther, managing director of the Helaba Merl, against overstatement about a conjunction with his house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Regardless of tyres but seems to recognize that a move together the various houses of the public sector is needed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Now that the Landtagswahl in Bayern is over, can be the first with a combination of bayernlb Landesbank Baden-Württemberg closer. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba is that is not necessarily good news. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The pressure to further mergers should rise gradually, they are in favour of the partners. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south, they would be confined junior partner, the financial crisis so far, even though they were much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A engagement with the West LB has, in turn, the Sparkassen- Giroverband hessen-thüringen, and with 85 percent of the Helaba is involved, at the beginning of the year, a barrier. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If anything, the North LB would remain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Such strategic considerations, but only one side of the coin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the other, there is the question of how different business models of the individual houses link up with each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June, Merl, the key question, what is the business model of the future capacity of the country banks should be guaranteed, and by the German Sparkassen- Giroverband has not been answered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> At the end could also be an disassembly of the West LB, but there are, of course, is not wanted. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It is in the letter of the board of directors said, it will certainly an "overall solution" for the House. </seg>
<seg id="34"> As is the case with the convergence of individual units with the deka-bank under one roof, only time will tell. </seg>

<seg id="21"> If, as some internal and subjective measure, yet, either because of the specific hardware, from our own experience, that brings us to analyse his research into major problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of the awareness, the science should be more easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It could be the consciousness processes of animals without regard to investigate their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the short memory of primates, especially in the case of the Visualisierung. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But for this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed up instead we are transferred to the neural Korrelate of consciousness than on the causal mechanism: both may be identical or not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It is interesting that this approach also stressed the importance of präfrontalen for achieving the cortex Visualisierung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What is now for the feelings? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I attribute it to the fact that an emotive system such as the fear in one of his own activity is conscious brain activated. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we describe as a "fear", is the mental state in which we find ourselves if the activity of the brain lokalisierten defence system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Feelings are seen as closely tied to the regions of the cortex, the primates and particularly the human arena. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Associated with the linguistic nature emerge paragon of varying degrees of sensitivity, because we need to use the words and grammar situations can categorise and differentiate ourselves alongside other fault. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Antonio Damasio, for example, on the other hand, thinks that feelings from primitiveren activities in the body feeling regions of the cortex and the Hirnstammes Jaak Vandemeulebroucke Pankseep similar to emerge, but that is focused more on the Hirnstamm. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Since this network in the course of human evolution, have not changed much there could well be involved in a generic overarching feelings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The theory, I can not disagree with me, but I think it is unbeweisbar. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues that what in rats and people like fear, is also likely to appear in both cases: but how they can check if rats and people the same experience, when they behave in the same way? </seg>
<seg id="35"> A Schabe sanctuary in danger if they also feels fear? </seg>
<seg id="36"> In my view, no resemblance of behaviour can simply prove Erlebens opportunities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> It helps the neurale comparison on: rats and people have similar Hirnstämme Schaben, on the other hand, not even a brain. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But is the Hirnstamm responsible for feelings? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if you could show that for the people: how they wanted to prove it in rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), feelings. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I do not know how I should prove it. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because their feelings likely differ radically from our (as the human awareness on specific becoming a circles and on language is based), erforsche I prefer the emotional behaviour as the emotional feelings of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Here offer any progress on the neural level, provided it in rats and people of the same. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As I language and conscience erforsche in rats, including not feelings, I do not know whether they exist. </seg>
<seg id="45"> This may consider to be short-sighted, but I come forward, rather than constantly to run against a wall. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I am just a practical Emotionalist. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The address Hispanic voters is a complicated task. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Barrack Obama proposals on the subject of education are a case in point. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="6"> "The Obama campaign said, the likelihood Afro-amerikanischen and Hispanic pupils at the school, a successful conclusion is lower than in white pupils' - and what is true. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This performance gap to close Bildungsplan specifically from other Obama recommends a bilingual footnote in the training for those who only learn English. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Still, there is the question to Obama, is whether his commitment to the bilingual training, focused on teaching in languages other than English, his interest is contrary to the distance in the school performance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A good example of '' Sixth street "preparatory conference", a primary school in East Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The majority of the pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of students, many of which are just recently in the country, learning English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, in 2008, amazing 100 per cent pupils of the fourth class the State test in Mathe insisted on the right level. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprising, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year in the English test as well. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This amazing success was achieved through other methods, than those who are preferred by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school Sixth street bases its focus to review and exercise at constant control of knowledge and an attitude that no exceptions should be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The school practises in addition to the approach after the training in an English-speaking environment. This is precisely the point that Obama is expected to consider the school leader Linda Mikels. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach stresses the importance of the almost ausschlies in the use of English slichen Fachunterricht. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mrs Mikels, rejects the idea zweisprachiger training, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil, the only about from Mexico 12 months later. Klassenraum would be to enter and will not be able to see again. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It works", realised to you, "it will work for us". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A school would Obama as the '' Sixth street "preparatory conference" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students pupils? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The services of school were the answer to that question lightly, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support the idea zweisprachiger training for a long time) and his own consistent support of bilingual training to make predictions about Obama answer uncertain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While he agrees to the point that immigrants need to learn English, he has trivialized the subject recently when he said that people should stop of concerns about on "only English" gathering legislation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, he said: "they should ensure that their child" in Spanish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama wants to close the performance gap actually carefully educational models, they should take into account the operation, rather than to trivialize and knock. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear that the hindsight perhaps exaggerated was that the pollution could aggravate his asthma problems. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Instead he has registered for the race in Berlin. </seg>

<seg id="7"> In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on goal, Gebrselassie - with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of special kind </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hidden between the excesses of leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, noisy and towering drive away, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of Afro-amerikanischen culture come to light. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the city, Zora Neale Hurstons, is not as simple as Hurston to describe it in 1935: "the city with five lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 Brown hides, 300 good Schwimmern Guaven, more than enough, 2 schools and no prison." </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is nowadays a pilgrimage site. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and ruby Dee, for the annual festival in Eatonville Zora, came at the most famous author of Harlem renaissance memory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And still remains the city and the describes it as a Touristenausflugsziel made by including them in the Florida began the tour guide to periods of depression by the Federal writers' project has been produced in many ways a place of particular variety. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eatonville is so independent, solid and private as in the 1930s than Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida are often refused to their true ideas to share with the Weissen man, "so little about us knows that he cannot escape what he knows." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even nowadays, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, at an open dialogue on race relations, there are many calls to suffering, of Aussenseitern to be seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "We are very anxious as our history is telling me 'Hortense Jones, 59, from birth, a resident of the town and Community Member of the oldest Church of the city. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must vote. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville was a paradox of triumph for a long time, and the fight. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is both a historic example of the black movement as a community of nearly 2,000 inhabitants, in the poverty levels twice as high as the national average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes sentenced, sometimes touted - black culture of rural south, whose roots lie in the American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not surprising that residents here both proud and at the hat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And really began the concerns of Eatonville's image with Zora Hurston, as all of the names. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the world their city, in books by heart, and in Mundart were written, as "Mules and men '' (1953) and" their eyes were watching God (1973). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide modified the city, which is very close to the route 77, a road through the centre of Florida, oft-vergessene leads to the scene of black history and human drama. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Vehemently as Oskar, both in real life and in the literature, led to the shop by readers of Hurston Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke wrote, and then to privateren affairs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "off the roads on the left," wrote it, "is the brown -weiss angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and game creation that always Howard Miller, although he can barely read and write." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn 'drinks of any kind was-auch-immer and sold to hours of rooms fit. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In just a few hundred words expressed so Hurston Eatonville with even government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was certainly not a tour guide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In fact, this was not a Portrait, which was estimated by everyone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "Zora described the situation as they were in the 90 year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the girls verewigte johnson- Hurston, quoted by the men, who sang songs on their beauty, the full sexual innuendo. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They added: "some people liked it". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> It is still here as a lively Exzentrikerin Hurtson regelmässig, who returned after their family after Jacksonville, Florida, was drawn. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus Franklin, 77, reminded that if Hurston gebraust came in the city, they usually without warning, in a noisy, Chevrolet rauchend and with trousers, the suicide today in a city is something at their August Kleidungsstil holds. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to Mr Franklin, the majority of people fascinated, though many despise them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "The people were always happy to see Zora ', said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But "they remained never too long," he added in his chair while he was added to the back schaukelte, at an altitude of the terrace listening to the Sabelia sea, in the eyes of Hurston in all likelihood was baptised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and a copy of their books. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Together with the majority of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten about it. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although it was once a famous author, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black women on Barnard college in the 1920ern, they have been in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they were buried in an anonymous grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eatonville, there was no major commemorations, no public readings in high style. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "I do not think that their contribution in the world, or at least have understood their heritage," Valerie Wrapped Boyd, author of "in Rainbows", a post on Hurston which was published in 2003. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The turning point came in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city, in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the Community. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlandos suburbs already had the motorway 4 through the western outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The proposal was put forward as a Eatonville, still of a difficult phase in its history a fortnight. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Forced integration, among other things, the relatively idyllic isolation of the Community. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the 1950s led the fight against racial mixing hatred in the Community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "in this time was often a bunch of white boys and they alleged oranges and stuff people who sit on the sidelines," said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "There was even a woman was killed in the process. </seg>
<seg id="44"> They raised a water melon from the car. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Hurston in 1955 behind asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the call of the Supreme Court to force, integration, making its decision in the case of brown as "offensive against the Schulrat respektierend 'instead of my race. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Inhabitants say today that although the lifting of racial division in some respects was positive, the groups cohesion in Eatonville and self-assurance weakened his young people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> "black children were used to be, hugged it - I remember - one embraced his teachers in the morning and it embraced his teachers on the evening in N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the not-for-profit group for the protection of Eatonville community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> It could be maintained for so long, they added, not by teachers and pupils came more from the same place. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "We embraced his White teachers not, because he was a white teacher - I think there is a cultural divide there," said Mrs Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> But the rights of citizens have contributed to the fact that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons has been created - black writers, actors and artists who put themselves through prejudices, as they did with positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society! </seg>
<seg id="51"> "I do not understand it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In 1975, the novelist Alice Walker on the path to Hurstons nameless grave and started for the revival of their glory. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Five years later was a lot of Robert e. Hemenway hurston-biographie promised to find shelves in the books, and made it back to a part of the American Literaturkanons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The fernstraßen project had just at a time in the Eatonvilles most famous daughter once again in the light of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And this time they saw as Retterin Hurstons old neighbours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The Community began in 1988 with the planning of Hurston festival in order to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the Eröffnungsevent two years later, and every January return many for the celebration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> Some years later, the district not by its roads. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "The plans a fünfspurigen Fernstraße crowded the city, accelerated the whole thing with top speed, we were left with genuine," said Mrs Nathiri Bürgerstolz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Mrs Boyd put it somewhat easier: '' Zora Eatonville saved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the fernstraßen project prompted a change of the image of the city. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There were more and more, as Rachelle Zugereiste Munson, a lawyer, here in the Church since 1993, and native started the past. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eatonville in 1998, the national historic register. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new einstöckige library (of course) opened named after Hurston in 2006 on the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Eatonville, today, it is still a peculiarity in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre anfühlen Orlandos, it can sometimes feel like a Hintergasse in the summer rains as small as at that time, only 27 of black families in the 1880ern was established. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (it is currently 90% black.) </seg>
<seg id="67"> Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are often still treated with caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most interviews, the approval in the run-up to necessary and certain things - just as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest church which was painted by a Weissen and black men in the toil - should not be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, confident teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot, still fear that their abgeschirmte Community is misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And yet at the same time to the hurston-festival bigger, was also a greater degree of Heimatstolz was born. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Young people in particular tend to be regarded as Hurston Eatonville saw their whole race: beautifully, with all its problems, either worse or better, and just as proud, creative and diligent, like any other ridiculous and durchmischt Rassen- and international group in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It is the sincere love for this city in the voice of Mr Franklins, the 18-year-old nephew can hear Edwin Harvey, the plans after the college after Eatonville back, in the town hall or in order to work with the police, according to him, which could use some help. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even the younger, as Alondra Kenon and Alexia, eleven-year-old twins from winter park, Eatonville, have learned to describe correctly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> "the most people, the only here, will think: 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other," said Alondra Kenon recently after the Church on a Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="75"> "But if we actually stop and a moment of its history of view it is a very beautiful city." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, the dream of many of us, some Olympic disciplines in Madrid after the failure to stage for 2012, as it can perhaps 2016. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But I wonder: '' we are prepared for it? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yes, we follow the example of the old road, I would say that it is not true! </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> It was described as the perfect street, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with all reason and truth in that, there was. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Of course, it is a lot of rubbish if the assessment and I would consider it could look at what is clearly not passage. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But from the start, we go through everything. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The nonsense begins with the Ticketholen, which allows you to go, as the first. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It also seems to me to be not bad, but if you act you are, then they should also give you everything (including chip, in order to avoid traffic jams on the street). </seg>
<seg id="10"> But not so. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is to go only then) and (after an endless queues) there is the surprise, the T-shirt there was only in the size '' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL). </seg>
<seg id="12"> Where we live in fact? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Or is it so that the next crisis has been decided only small, much cheaper to buy shirts from less substance? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Well, matters such as this are peanuts compared to the days on the road. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Apart from the fact that we must go very early in order to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, it must be the Rucksack. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The wait has more than 35 minutes, as in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected, is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Finally, as it was to be expected on the streets, and we had our return bags are not afraid, even if it was even managed to call back but it would be difficult. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It also saw it, in these 40 minutes after rain waiting for, so it was a popular uprising, the temptation to organise and to invade the Häuschen. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I think that tomorrow will certainly some 500 people have pneumonia and some as I will be the chip, because of this I received, not even in time for the classification, and I can already think that the outcome wrong has been branded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Of course, if you ask me for a perfect road, it would never thought I would. </seg>
<seg id="21"> I believe, we still have long dream of a city for the Olympic Games is well prepared </seg>

<seg id="2"> On the '' emerging technology conference, Microsoft veranstalte on the progress of the new images detection system and the interaction between humankind and presented a nature of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, which is capable of some primitive work to do, such as a taxi (or order in the case of Microsoft, this is a routes planners on the campus of the company). The system to get what it considered during the entertainment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Thanks to a camera and a violation of form and face distinguishing system Rezeptionistin, this' 'to see how many people in the area are who they are and even recall, as it were, it is the key to listen and understand their entertainment. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> This is certainly the future. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Now has the company better matters on which it is able to focus, for example, to the next version of its windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="11"> We talked this week about the very superficial change of strategy by Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Windows 7 will be more quickly and not so many eingebundene programmes. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Steve Ballmer, noted that if the computer with the necessary, rather than they would be equipped with the commercial waste to fill five times faster, you would function. Man, Steven, that is just for the few. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Everything is just an observation, given that Microsoft windows versions in one or other function and '' to see. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The shift is worth </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Microsoft is right, the operating system is now losing in importance, just like the software. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As Google chromium in the network appeared, it was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google, in order to compete with windows. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Were sent to point out that the browser is not operating system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The operating system, as an indispensable part will always be needed to ensure that the hardware and software at the same time can function. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The operating system meets the role with the function of his wife or his or her husband comparison can be made when it comes to his mother-in-law something to say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> This is true. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The system will never disappear, but must be made to his death '', not as an absolute, but rather as a relative truth, thinking. </seg>
<seg id="23"> What Ballmer, said this week, is the affirmation of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The people pay less attention every time the operating system, more the web-browser. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The computer will only be initiated the Firefox, the Explorer or chromium to implement and every day that we spend more time on surfing, than in the surroundings of the 'window'. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What serves half in the computer of existing applications? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Less is more " </seg>
<seg id="28"> And windows 7 is more compact, much more compact than vista. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Easier, not so excessive, less complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The interest of Microsoft's, there is more to integrate its online services, finally the alternative to Google. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In reality you need it, no doubt about it. I am a small example. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The photograph of this place I have in Redmond, in one of the recreational spaces for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In the soft drinks dispenser is a shield securely fixed: '' your search. Our future. It prints a request from our own tool to use for online-suche. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Meeting - from the blood that, once, of course, was </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema-quebec yesterday was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its creation, and its President, Dr Mrs Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because hema-quebec is one of the safest and most effective blood banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And, above all, it has gained the confidence of the public by the scandal by the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was considerably shaken. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As we know, were the donated blood service of the Canadian Red Cross national Blutreserven administered during the 1980s with HIV and Hepatitis c-virus contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In light of this drama and the public discontent led the Canadian government in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever mounted an investigation, it aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and directives for a new disaster to prevent this type. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judge Krever, his report still hesitated to make several provinces at the time, asked a Committee on the legs, whose aim was to a new system for managing blood to develop in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Committee met in Quebec Gélineau this mission. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the reports of Gélineau Krever, and two blood banks: founded in Canada for hema-quebec Quebec is responsible, and the Canadian Blutgesellschaft, about the other provinces and the two territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Hema-quebec '1998, their work has included 38% of the people had very little faith in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr Décary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was dispiriting. </seg>
<seg id="11"> By the enormous efforts in order to improve the safety of the blood and through the work in this area during the next year, we have won the confidence of the public, it says, before you proud stressed that the beginning of 2008 now almost 94% of the population hema-quebec had confidence in Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, Dr Décary 'confidence in the knowledge that something is extremely fragile.' ' </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its creation on 28 September 1998 hema-quebec is following the principle of caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At this time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe with a new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman since the creation of 1998, which holds the leadership. </seg>
<seg id="15"> '' and we have not had the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted by blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So we invoked one of the main directives of the reports and Gélineau Krever, according to one exclusion measures, if we did not know and if a disease only slowly, as it seems, in the case of the disease is caused by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In April 1999, so it was no blood of people who are since 1980, more than a month in the United Kingdom had stopped. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, a few years ago, without any doubt, demonstrated that the disease transmitted by blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This event has shown us that the principle of caution that we, the sense of rigid. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999 on the market seemed a much more precise technology to detect HIV: the nukleinsäure-tests (NST), which will make it directly in the blood of the donor to prove the existence of the virus itself, and it is not the antibodies against the virus, like the hitherto tests of the case. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST enabled to shorten the incubation period, between the time the person was infected and, if the first viruses through our techniques can be found in the blood, states the specialist, is taking place. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time, to a period of less than a week will be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It was the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it, and we could not see substantially reduced. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion, to a considerable extent to transfer to lower them. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Today there is a risk of 12 million people with HIV infected blood. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "in other words, that means that we should distribute 12 million blood before someone infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As hema-quebec every year between 400 and 500 000 blood, I would be distributed more than 24 years before a case in which HIV acts on a Blutkonserve. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that we are now in the process, if you can feel comfortable receiving a blood transfusion or wants to restore the health ', says the head of direktions by hema-quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> '' our challenge for the next 10 years, the safety of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows what pathogens can reach into the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year at the reunion is the appeared, the chikungunya-virus, just as the westnil-virus, by insects on the blood is transferred. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must monitor driving continuously, Dr Décary continued, before she points out that hema-quebec alongside a safe supply in addition to provide an adequate supply. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "The demand is rising, because the population is getting older. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Since the treatments are more aggressive cancer patients often need or new red blood cells, platelets. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The ageing population also has an impact on the Blutspendernetz, to an average of only 3% of the donations appropriate natives of Quebec. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> It is every healthy man, the 18 years or older, and the eligibility criteria are met, all 56 days, six times a year, blood donations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On average 14% of the people who their blood available, not accepted because they, for example, of AIDS or malaria, and anyone who has travelled in a country where malaria is endemic, will be excluded from the donations for a year. </seg>
<seg id="38"> 'with these 3% we make it an inventory to that meets the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A lack of stockpiles are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But we must renew the members of the donor network, as they grow older and no blood more donations. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and encourage them to make regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The life today is so hectic that it is seldom finds the time to spend an hour in the blood, '' Mrs Francine Décary regrets. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of $297 million hema-quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, almost exclusively with serious fire violations is used. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These tissues are frozen, processed and investigated before they can be stored with hema-quebec, which is also the only public umbilical cord blood bank Quebec managed. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord that previously had been seen as a biomedical waste, is also on stem cells rich blood which could help serious diseases, such as leukaemia, to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="46"> '' a few weeks ago, we celebrated our tausendsten stored umbilical cord sample, and we plan to buy more than a thousand a year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> "I suppose we should start at the beginning of next year, it is available for transplants, says Dr Décary on this programme of Nabelschnurblut- describes as a loss very popular. </seg>
<seg id="48"> 'many mothers are convinced, to have no access to it, because hema-quebec lack funding, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals to offer Quebec. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Free opinion - the Orwellian talk of Barrick gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In its edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, vize-generaldirektor Barrick gold of the Canadian gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms this, and followed an Orwellian logic that the biggest goldgewinnungs society in the world a libel case on six million against three authors and a small mittelloses Publications Service sought, with the goal of being a '' to open public debate. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is true that the judges independent and impartial judgments, then you are not on the truth, especially not in the case of smear lament, but about the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Because of Barrick gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, everyone in the business who dares to drive, one of the their opposite view. </seg>
<seg id="7"> No matter how the process, the authors and the editor of the book States Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight the from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine are paid. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactics in this unequal fight is in fact often, the defenders to ruin an amicable settlement in order to force the opposing side to silence the power and furthermore who dares to dissuade again at the question. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick gold really wanted to a public debate, she would have their view of things must present in the face of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Contrary to what many of the countries in which works, Barrick gold, are usually in Canada debates by the exchange of ideas and not by Knüppelhiebe. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This could have been enough unless the gold mine their books and files to the table and a real debate would have opened up by the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent Prüfteams, would have the light on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick gold seems no confidence in the public opinion aside, and to the petitions and letters in support of the authors from States Canada with a snap of his fingers to one side. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Could perhaps Mr Garver explain how he make an 'public' debate but can ask the opinions of the same public contempt? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently includes the word in the world of Vice-President just the generous paid lawyers, and not the Community of Canadians; a very nice beengte view of the concept. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy of the detractors have the right to speak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Does not understand what Barrick gold - or do not want to understand - is that the public, the authors and publishers of States, Canada supports doing it, particularly because they opposed the brutal attitude of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This public is prepared to do so, Barrick listen and to judge, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework, whom many perceive as knebel-klage (in the course of the '' public debate Barrick gold has just made a call to the authors from States Canada, in which she asked of them not to use the term...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to the surreal speech by Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct assault on the freedom to academic research and the truth, it is an essential component of any democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It denies absolutely the right to quote from credible sources and about facts and interpretations to discuss, form the basis of the intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it in a country like Canada is impossible to investigate and issues to discuss, the rich companies of this world, who else will be able to do? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick gold really wanted to a public and open debate, could lead them by the scientific standards, the authors of States Canada have been used. </seg>
<seg id="22"> She has a right to reply. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The university environment to which we belong, White for a long time, debates and disagreements over control and to resolve conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that, contrary to what they claim, no desire to a transparent debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the Universitätswelt, as well as for public debate, and it is time for the governments to take action to limit this type of unwarranted lawsuits. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The main contents are: a better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms for the repayment of the public money, new orders, to secure because of the number of payment arrears gepfändeten houses, as well as the right to stem to monitor the salaries to the senior executives of the companies supported paid. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The U. S. Financial Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and in the negotiations representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, proclaimed yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "We have made great progress towards an agreement, which will be marktwirksam ', said the representatives of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. </seg>
<seg id="7"> '' it was all in the real economy and the American people before the Kurskrise on Wall Street to defend, said the Democrat. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "This is the fundamental point: if we do not, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of Americans be enormous', said the Republicans Judd Gregg. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, for fear of the impact that another failure on the mood of the investors have had. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The deadline, which had been agreed was the Markteröffnung this morning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The two American presidential candidates, the only late in the negotiations were involved, rather than supporters of the agreement, but without to miss to express their dissatisfaction that they must take to these extreme way. </seg>

<seg id="13"> The taxpayers' 'if you asking because of the irresponsibility of certain people to take extraordinary measures, that is not what we could congratulate themselves. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But these measures are necessary, '' he told on American television channels. </seg>
<seg id="15"> On another channel when he was asked whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: "I would like to only know the details, but I hope it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "The phrases that I have read [show] that this is a matter that we will all have to digest, and we will be able to continue. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The option to do nothing, is simply not acceptable, 'he said. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The 700 billion, dollar-plan is aligned with the taxpayers' money </seg>
<seg id="19"> He is 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble, the first of the collapse of the risky mortgage loans (Subprime), before they are recently taken steps towards loans to other forms verbreiteterer (PCAA), and, finally, in a freezing the financial strength and in the ruin of banks and financial institutions. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It was a group of Republican Member of the last week, the first attempt failed to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Since the Democrats have accepted that some 'toxic' assets of the companies in trouble only guaranteed by the government and not to be bought, people think the impasse. </seg>
<seg id="22"> At the point of view for all matters in Congress, has also been added a disposal, which says that if the government with this programme within five years, then they should make losses could impose new taxes to invest their capital. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to another 100 billion if President can be added there is a need. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The extra 350 billion in a repeat vote must be approved by Congress. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In return for its aid Washington shares in the company, which supported him in the case of profits dividends, and the table can sell it again, if the storm is over. </seg>

<seg id="27"> The developers of the plan would like to have that the Chamber of Deputies already votes on it, and then the Senate on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Despite all its efforts, is still not certain that their plan will be given the green light. </seg>
<seg id="29"> More votes actually rose up against this idea yesterday, both from the Republicans and the democrats. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Washington '' obviously understands us not ', said the Republicans Scott Garett, a Member of the financial Commission of the Chamber, his constituents. </seg>
<seg id="31"> '' Yes, we have a big financial problem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Yes, there are solutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But not the, which is to ask the taxpayers to pay. '' </seg>
<seg id="34"> The democratic Member Brad Sherman, the head of a group in Congress, the '' of the sceptics of Kaukus things is known, is different, but to the same conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="35"> 'four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to tell us that we are not going to ask the Congressional pressure and think carefully about what path is,' 'he said yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, we were again in Europe to prove that it is a global crisis. </seg>

<seg id="5"> State funds and subsidies from the self-government HUF 65 million in total - are part of the coffers of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, part in the private funds of individual fees. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As the investigation authorities were aware of the concern gave the tendering funds fictitious invoices and the clubs should also be failed to comply with its obligations. </seg>

<seg id="7"> According to the indictment is a large part of the bills have been falsified. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The accounting units on the market, which bought by Józsefváros Rundsiegel it allowed in Kiskunhalas. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The decision of the bills on what companies should be issued on the tour, was north of Lake Balaton firmly with the István Lados was sent by János contract. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the wake of these '' Erkundungstour Lados pensions and restaurants should track down. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He asked about the bills, later to Konsumationen on these proposals based bills for the youth and Sportministerium, social welfare and Labour Minister, as well as the autonomy of Budapest cheques. </seg>
<seg id="12"> These calculations are predominantly by István Lados and his accomplices have been manipulated András ri, according to our information, the latter of those reports for the Constitution is rumoured to have been responsible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> One of the objectives of Lados' "Erkundungstour" was a Bierlokal. </seg>
<seg id="14"> As two of the award and CO in 2003 bills issued from the catering company, is the Group of the association neunzigköpfige Biztos Pont Egyesület bewirtet. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Now, but the head of the business, such a large party would not even get to the local heart suit them. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Another bill in the summer of 2002, issued at the foundation Jobb jövért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik évezredért, has also serious violation of form and content errors. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In a retirement in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and not more than ten people at the same time can compose, according to bill 130 guests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The imagination of the counterfeiters were also apparently no bounds when it comes to the Pigal Kft., a catering business, in its accounting documents of customers, according to the indictment Hoppá Jobb jövért and not even proceeds of authority. </seg>
<seg id="19"> As directors of hvg gyz Farkas. Hu indicated that he was immediately clear that it was forged documents, than it was during a survey by the Prosecutor's Office documents were provided. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "our Firmenname and the tax number were on the mark wrong appropriate". </seg>
<seg id="21"> And further: apart from procedural irregularities was also the fact wrong that the company is to have a hundred people living there, when they have a total of 11 rooms of the impossible so many people place. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is also on the bill, it would have been referred to feed the restaurant for some time now are no longer in operation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="23"> The diligent accounting counterfeiters have also neglected to check that the Budapest travel agency plans to target them exclusively offers trips abroad, and you have to take barzahlungs Hungarian visits, which indicated the accounting practice of company also denied. </seg>
<seg id="24"> As it was known as part of the investigation, you are in addition to the bills also cited the VAT, although travel agency based on a country outside the EU, added value are tax-free. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The level of VAT was a total of four from the hotel. To the foundation Révfülöp Kft Jobb jövért issued bills wrong because the company rather than 25 only 15 per cent VAT, set off by the staff will also be issued only mechanised bills were, however, the counterfeit documents noted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Another mistake, of the '' undermine Rechnungslegern was that it was the transport of goods in a case '' as output, although this had stated by the company specialising in investment advice being offered, told the prosecutor with. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Another procedural irregularities, false accounting format, thanks to the wrong stamp - was that the on Együtt a Harmadik évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület Biztos Pont invoices issued and could be exposed as a fraud. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As in the case of Ravenna. And the Sportlager BT Kunfehértó, whose business leaders protested that the bills never to have issued. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Another "errors" is the counterfeiters in the HIB Kft. From Nyíregyháza undermined: this society was at the time (2001) just in dissolution, as the Group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület there have eaten - the Masseverwalter, was not issued, the bills themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Deliberately falsified </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The other group of Rechnungsleger are people who have been well aware that they are fictitious invoices. </seg>
<seg id="32"> At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal, the Foundation has Ifjú Szocialisták Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation, a Harmadik Együtt évezredért HUF in a level of some 4 million issued. </seg>
<seg id="33"> According to the indictment was the manager of the Collab Kft. By one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi exhibition, persuaded the fictitious invoices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> At the moment Biogate Kft is also in liquidation.

<seg id="35"> However, there was also little payment transactions, as the bills immediately after their exhibition cancelled what the victims have forgotten in your documents to be recorded, however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The third group of Rechnungsleger covers people directly associated with the defendants. </seg>
<seg id="37"> One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian business leader of the Delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, where fuel and vehicle but not auffindbaren handelsfirma. </seg>
<seg id="38"> This company is, in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of a total of edv-komponenten HUF have issued about 18 million. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Directors of that company was one such documents, which the companies also Iván Kubatov should be delivered between 2002 and 2005. </seg>
<seg id="41"> According to our information has been Kubatov during the investigation, bills on behalf of gmbh. Atlasz and to the clubs, as well as Hoppá Együtt évezredért Alapítvány issued a Harmadik and whose value even touched. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The companies fa-bani Jos Faipari Kft. And the jos-investment BT by Romanian bricklayers. Are Iván Kubatovs express request to be created. </seg>
<seg id="43"> But in truth, none of these firms active Angeklagtem which, according to a lack of contracts. </seg>
<seg id="44"> But he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplices, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, with the preparation of the companies founding documents, he was charged in the name of the companies with premium bills in the clubs in contact, such as issued in Atlasz and y-generáció. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> As a whole, worth a total of 15 bills Kubatov HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies cash investment, Delta, Trió fa-bani Jos Linaxtrade Jos, investment and on the organizations have issued. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The Prosecutor's office estimates that each Kubatov Rechnungssumme and 10% of the value added tax scheme could have. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The company would even Kubatov szi-beri BT. For the exhibition imaginary bills have abused - in this case, the bills the candidacy of Biztos Pont disappeared. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> The company y-generáció and Szövetség a modern in January 2006 Magyarországért have their applications in the not-for-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Mihály TMA Táncsics Alapítvány (''). </seg>
<seg id="49"> Both received the 500,000 Forint, however, have benefited from these sums being derailed. </seg>
<seg id="50"> At this, you have to cover up the TMA five fictitious invoices of Works team Kft.. </seg>
<seg id="51"> These calculations were also in the raid of the office of árpád Kemecsei in the Education Ministry assured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In the negotiations will now with a confession by some defendants on the approach of the accounting counterfeiting, as they were before the prosecutor, expected to be accounted for. </seg>
<seg id="53"> A sensation could happen if the main defendants János award to a full confession decides. </seg>
<seg id="54"> His previous indications were less detailed several times, and even though he had already pledged fully to report about everything, is still waiting for his confession. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The question therefore remains open to question whether this is in its interests, whether the Socialists a pact with him about the compensation of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million have concluded, and whether award in return is prepared to take responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="56"> But it is entirely possible that contract now plays the "Beleidigten" after his requests to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest have fallen on deaf ears. </seg>
<seg id="57"> While other criminals with economic offences far greater damage and they do not have paid at liberty, or at least, remains under house arrest, denied supplement this possibility. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Worshippers have less pain? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As the latest research results show that the religious belief as a kind of "pain relievers' effect, which already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Scientists of Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: it has been investigated whether the belief in God, the pain of the human influences, reported the British '' telegraph. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the course of the rather bizarre investigation ever received 12 believers and atheists electric shocks while studying a painting of the mother of God. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the results showed the faithful were able to switch off the bulk of pain. </seg>
<seg id="6"> By means of a hirn-scan technology could even prove that Catholics have been able to activate the part of your brain, which is responsible for the pain of regulation. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The study was the first in a research project, in the alongside scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University of participating. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The subjects in the attempt was a funkelndes machine on the left hand, what the electric shocks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to be greatly on two paintings to focus: a picture of the mother of God, painted in the 17th century from Sassoferrato, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin". </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped that the sight of the young girl Maria among the believers would create a kind of religious Trance, while you auswählten Vincis picture, because it is almost the other paintings difference and was seen as a reassuring. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The individuals per half an hour crossing in a MRI scanner during this time, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they either the religious, or the other paintings should look. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Catholics reported they had been at the sight of the mother of God "in security" felt as if they were - '', and they would "calm and peace". </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the Betrachtens religious Gemäldes you have about 12% reported less pain than if they had Leonardos work in mind. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias, also attended the attempt, said that it could be similar effects, also with other, strong retrospective images in the atheists, would need to be exposed the photograph. </seg>

<seg id="2"> At its tenth birthday of Google can safely say: it is in the pockets of the people in the same way to find on their heads, as the sky: you know, where people have spent their holiday specialist, for what they are going, and what they move. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the chief executive officer of Google. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the direction of sceptics who are beset by Orwellian nightmare visions, he is very: they would host the essence of the Web 2.0. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google is even more personal data on the user to collect and so the original objective to get closer to the company, which states that "all information" wants to sort out of this world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt said Google is after ten years weltverändernder work is still only at the beginning of the information collection. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Asked after the status quo in five years, said Schmidt: he would like to Google would be able to questions like "what can I do tomorrow?" or "what job really fits me?" to answer, however, software programmes are not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Not all internet-user are aware that, in the context of their Internet searching the Suchbegriffe were registered, as well as the IP addresses, from where sought, and the visited pages. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The two years ago, for example, Personalized Search '' introduced its own Suchverlauf allows the visitors to resort to store and later so that the hit later can be generated a lot more precise, based on the same logic and also the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system of tailored products and services as a result of the previous preferences recommends. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The user issues, though, is what is happening in the event of Datenmissbrauchs - "if you check what I make", are some concerned whether the Google data monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In most cases, however, it is rather represented by the firm, potential power, the terrifying effect, and less the guilt or the fear of punishment, the quest for freedom or the rebellion against the power, with many internet-usern turn against it. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, it is a proven fact that the Suchbegriffe not only stored, but also in the character will be passed on to third parties, and in this legislative cases there is no protection for the rights of the internet-users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A perfect example was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, as part of its Google gave the Brazilian government information by the Gemeinschaftssite Orkut name '' have been collected and also a identification of Pädophilien. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A personal rights worried users have been able to breathe a sigh of relief, but even in May than Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against the FBI to Court: that can Google also in future with no area of the Constitution be forced the FBI information to a secret question. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (However, the Federal Government has successfully the publication of 50,000 Suchbegriffen Webadressen and 1000 years ago with reference to the minors act passed, but it was obtained from the list of individual users, or the two months Suchbegriffsliste Web- and retroactively.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> So Google's image remains a contentious issue: those who are reluctant to their personal data because they are classified by the use of the google- services the loss of their private and privacy are afraid that plagues the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, the American 'geek-kultur ", which is present in many countries, and enthusiastic Computerfans unites activists and youth, the next generation of" coolen entrepreneurs "in you, unlike Microsoft windows, is market leader, even if both at the same goal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> A reason for this is that Google its users, in contrast to Microsoft, and no Identifizierungscodes demands of its services available for free, and that a more open, constantly updated far more attractive package used and new, young people and appear to be cooler than the official practices of the software giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Geeks, on the other hand, suggested the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet knife sharply - a relationship, particularly in the past few years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" in focus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The "Web 2.0" is nothing other than about collaboration, in other words, users have left deliberately traces and is the use of available channels of communication, and even if the proportions of individually are different, the main remains the same --- to show themselves in public. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At the same time, to an average of young people can be managing several Community gateways, from Facebook profile of Xanga, this through other services, such as Twitter, or Musikdienste like last. FM, and can combine all this in a follow-up system such as friendfeed or blip. FM. In addition, blogs, which you can represent the latest Fotogalerien automatically on Flickr or Picasa geostet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a number of other classic cases shows: looking at the Partyfotos last night, the friend soon, with whom she has untreuer friend vergnügt, or the staff will be dismissed, because he was in his blog only too honest his anger on the management of the air force, one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been interpreted completely new. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Who leads a online-leben is what he preisgibt - by itself could be so in around the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's young people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And anyone who tries anything to keep secret, or even to circumvent the google- monopoly, that can be happy to do so - such as those with Scroogle, a Tool, which is on the search engine of Google zugreift, but deliberately no trail. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Not a few people choose not to register on Community parties, so that they are not be setting ever-higher standards, but also the online applications, such as by Google and Textverarbeitungs- rss-feeds grafische tools and can deal with alternative versions, which are tied to no huge Serverparks and therefore not the best possible profiles of users it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> However, public opinion is waiting to overcome by Google, its true face shows. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With their current value of about $156 billion, the company even before IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), from Werbeflächen adwords / adsense threaten the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the ever faster imported services are preparing not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical observer, however, find the disturbing Gegenpole: for example, the company has led a protest by the staff completely dismissed the charges, after the company's children garden doubled, also said the management of the frequent meals of staff is too costly. All this sounds but quite mild against the fact that Google in 2006 even before the Chinese Government to its knees, and with an agreement was critical hits, for all the regime, or those who are against the good taste, were extracted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal regulation of the group is that no new service advertised in advance, but only if they could already is available. However, the events of the next few months and years back some strong department: while some believe Google's Buch- and Magazinscan- or archiving project now take proportions that the company soon with the Supreme Court should address other rather, it is because of the system "health" concerned that the creation of a complete health profile on the basis of convicted, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the fact that Google provides a genetic database, building the next generation of sci-fi writers already the substance, about '' the famous Scroogled Cory Doctorow novel with the best of Orwellian fashion describes a future in which one person thanks of Google nahbar frighteningly personal data. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> What would be the best way to the development of new technologies to accident prevention, if not the hindernis- sensors from the nature to imitate? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example, the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At CEATEC Japan was presented a startling project, in which the nissan- engineers of Hummeln in the creation of new accident vermeidender systems have been inspired. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokyo University has managed by Autorobotern Nissan biomimetische system built by the type BR23C, a mini-auto, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the flight each bee forms its own oval "private area", of our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technologie-pr and research development during the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The composite eye of the bee in every direction, and in a corner of more than 300 degrees can see games to play an important role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The function of the composite eye, the researchers tried to imitate the idea of the lasergesteuerten distance a knife. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It identifies obstacles in the BR23C in a Gesichtsfeld of 180 degrees within 2 metres, its distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor on board, the process immediately avoided the collision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The obstacle is registered in fractions of seconds, and the Autoroboter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, allowing the tyres at the appropriate spot. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unlike previous systems will take place this ploy purely instinctively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "If there were no Autoroboter could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, the head of the "mobility laboratory" and the autoroboter-projektes. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must respond instinctively and immediately because the technology the intimate and most vulnerable part of the shield - a coating inside the accidents still as inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if you avoid other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And that must take place in the fraction of a second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The duck cannot, however, in contrast to the bees, right up, not down, or even diagonal - it can only be developed along two dimensions and only in the direction of the tyre Wendbarkeit. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Here during the bees infinitely many opportunities available to other bees, the researchers have been able to sidestep the Autoroboter only the Drehbewegung, or of speeding up and Abbremsens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The contains BR23C lithium- polymer batteries, which are more and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional lithium-ionenbatterien. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Andoh, said it is the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This machine per second only a few inputs must process and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It must not store them, or on the basis of previous manoeuvres, logical reaction producing a generates intuitions, so it is constantly just a handful of KB Memory to be used. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There is no need for Gigabyte- and Megabyte-schwerer Memories. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step in the evolution of the immediate collision avoidance technology, according to an estimate by Nissan within the next ten years will be serial residence in production. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="24"> Another application of the technology could find in the GPS satellite navigation, making it the motorists aware and draws on barriers around him as the target. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In the first round of the half of the money should be spent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In a session, the East coast after midnight local time on Saturday ended, the Congressmen have started next to an agreement on the debates managed 700-milliarden-dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported. </seg>
<seg id="5"> "We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic President in the US House of Representatives, and said the agreement that we should only on paper. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The compromise reached on the bailout - supported both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the result: the programme will have an effect and it will only be effective, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi if it were not talking about the rescue of Wall Street, but the helm of the economy rumzureißen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The written version of the package was made even before the opening of the Asian markets, 8 p. m. on Sunday night, Washington time (Central European time Monday 2 a. m.), but has no Indian Ocean, published on the stock. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Congress on Monday is first on the bill to stabilise the economy from 2008, then the Senate's turn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday night, with Pelosi, and also the White House welcomed the news of the deal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> We are pleased with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts from both parties, our markets to stabilise and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The programme but deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, which claims that the $700 billion for the purchase, lazy, with loans of strain in the securities should be spent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a first tranche is a maximum of half of the 700-milliarden-betrages 250 billion will be spent, and are available immediately after the Congress as expected on Monday will vote on the issue. This sum is credit for the purchase of contaminated, poor securities will be spent, and the other is $100 billion the President decide. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The programme will be reviewed by a own Commission, who also is a member of the President of the Federal Reserve. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The other half of 700 billion depends on another decision of Congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the spirit of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactics: it can at the same time bad loans, mortgages and securities purchased using laden with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As competent persons of the Ministry reported, can the purchase both in an auction, and directly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The law allows the companies to take part in an insurance scheme, in which the Ministry of Finance the disturbing funding secured, and the companies the anticipated damage similar charges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Henry Paulsen said: the law defines the tools necessary so that up to 700 billion dollars in emergency aid for the American financial system can be made available, be it for the large-scale purchase bad money, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk by the collapse of a major Geldinstituts is triggered. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We have the necessary steps so that we are prepared for the introduction of the law, as soon as we signed, so Paulson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The heads of the hard-pressed and now reliant on government aid, however, banks can expect that their controls in the übersee-slang colloquially known as' 'golden Handshake, the government will be cut. </seg>
<seg id="22"> A cut in salaries, there will be only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance aushilft respectively. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The reduction in essence means that if the department as part of an auction buying, '' the golden Handshake is taxed, unless the outgoing Bankenchef will go to the retirement. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In the event of a direct purchases of bad loans is the government's aggressive play to ensure that the managers' salaries should not be exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The picture is that the existing golden handshake- contracts are not changed - the restrictions only pertains to new agreements so that all the more people to take part in the programme. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager- salaries are governed by law, annotated the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The state wins rights of participation for the participating banks, so that the risk to the taxpayer is declining, as they are, as soon as it can also join the economy and hence the Geretteten bank is better off again. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress over the next five years to submit a proposal as the taxpayer needs to regain its lost money from the financial sector to get back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, there were on both sides, the sceptics in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. </seg>

However, under the name "United Democratic Forces' (ODS) held view before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko seriously hoped for in the unhealthy elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment already 2006 presidential mandate renewed, this time for the fourth time some members of the opposition in the Parliament '' would allow. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is why the ODS even by the previously planned boycotts. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ukraine, thanks to the rising price of natural gas imports of becoming ever more dependent on Russia economically. For the relief of the price increases were even credits, and the country has included the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the leading gas pipeline across the country, the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition was thus the hope, Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-level politicians classified as anti-democratic because of the political system in the EU travel ban. </seg>

<seg id="12"> According to the opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006, is a continuation of desirable, although "the powerful fear, also received only to let a opposition in the Parliament". </seg>
<seg id="13"> The opposition is planning a protest action following the results, but rather the need for economic reform the electorate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "We have here with many problems - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities have obstacles in the way on distribution, but nevertheless, I have noticed that more and more people support the change, even the older", said Milinkevich, in allusion to the fact that not even the most support pensioners' group agrees with the Lukashenko regime whose sole credit for the production of social security. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "thanks to the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, it is just a matter of time before the to the silence of a Friedhofes gemahnende" Social Security "to crumble, so Milinkevich. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the actions, and not the words". The absence of the opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the White Russian voters. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had already revealed a few days than the Chamber of Deputies, committing against the $700 billion dollar sparpaket of the White House agreed: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing, the Wall Street than to save the economy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Confirmed that yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported back, such as the crisis in the Republican Party Laufschritt that is increasingly divided in their old divides and moderate East coast-seele, which is always the state institutions, and the business community, and the neoconservative, 'those in Washington, "and the financial sector, and particularly hostile to the south and the centre of the States electorate. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the Party owes his rise of V. a. the voice of the I referred to above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This aforementioned example, however, is only a small part of the great changes that will announce the current economic earthquake or even already represents: not only in the United States, including throughout the West, and perhaps even on this, this will be affected. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both in the States and in Europe, it seems that the crisis to speed up the long feared events, which under this new conditions finally take shape and come to light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the outrageous renaissance of the State in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact means the crisis a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which have close links to the abroad and at the same time a tremendous amount of the assets of private individuals who manage to live in a single state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means a direct political problem for the governments: as to the affected families to behaviour, which is also an enormous Wählermasse. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis seems economically politically against global, it is almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism would seem to be put to one side and his freedom of speech to have lost: the obvious proof has been given by the EU which, because of their division in various national and international conflicts to find no common way. </seg>
<seg id="12"> So all now count with the intrusion of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and B. a. distribution of relief funds: since the crisis was always more seriously, only the United States in the economic situation without foreign aid to save. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And, in addition to the resources they have also the legitimacy of using them, therefore, two not to überwertende conditions under certain circumstances, in what otherwise have no international organisation and a market could be in a similar way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The new emphasis on the staatlich- national element, is also in perfectly compatible with the growing importance, the recently in the economy with a closely related sector is implicated: the territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> More paradoxical way, it is just now than we were so convinced, however, long in a networked Gesamtreich to be entered into an empire of the increasingly sophisticated technologies, of the intangible that we need to establish our future, as more and more from the essential material things will depend, of water, harvest and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They can certainly all from one place to the rest of the world, but are yet to be transported to extreme with a closely linked a territory umschriebenen piece of earth. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The person who is therefore on such a territory, a towards others in an ernteertraglosen wasserlosen or oil, free area lives, the advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I come to the second novelty, but a brief insertion. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who territory, who government policy says, who also says that leadership. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In that sense, I think that the financial crisis to produce two converging phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> One hand there is the knowledge about the need for distinguished Leaderships, the need for someone who knows how to regulate the things. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other side there is now a wave of indignation at the current leaders, particularly those of the economy, which turns as inadequate and full of Schattenzonen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In addition to a more far-reaching and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, a impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distance, which is all to a whole class of managers of the Western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It seems so the conviction among large sections of the population solution that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but their Ideenwelt, their way of life, their culture in the broad sense of the word, whose content, whether the majority always as a foreign and outdated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand for leadership so cultivating a diverse underground but powerful movement and the removal of the leaders of the traditional political establishment. This is manifest in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in unvermittelten collective emotions swing in the state of the last time, starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights also plays a role in Italy here). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also its observance, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value in terms of what today in the bottom of the social strata of the West, and reinforced by the financial crisis and to überdimensionalität ambitions. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Given all this, it would be too much of a "rebellion of mass" to speak. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The eyes but far to keep an open mind, however, is certainly not. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historic cinema close Multiplexkinos because of the beneficiaries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "a city without cinemas is a blind city, as a face without eyes." </seg>
<seg id="4"> This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore in effect describes what is currently in the large urban centres of Italy, and in the provinces. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of exclusion of cinema, with the birth of the great Multisaalkomplexe began in the periphery, in the long term, means the death for the Einsaalkino centre. A process, not just seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also the features of a cultural crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Hit historic places are usually full of memories, "it is like losing a friend, which is a piece of streets full of emotions has come," as the director of the film "Cinema Paradiso" nuovo, which gave him 20 years ago and Oscar moved the big price of Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and its nostalgia, what it is, in a good Kinowelt lost to live for ever. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The figures, which the Anec, the central industry association provided a clear language talk: in the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas have closed; this bill for the most part paid the cinema in the main cities, 9: 10 in Florence, Bologna in Milan, Naples and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> One of the most badly affected regions include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Toskana with 44 and Lombardy with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This shows that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions, in which the largest number of these modern cinema: registered with 195 in the last five years, the Lombardy in the lists, 81, both in the Toskana and in the Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The business has developed in a irrational manner", so Paolo Protti, the President of the Anec, "while it is useful that new structures, but on top of the preservation of already existing because, includes a House in the city, not all of his captive customers are willing, instead of the old one Multiplexkino going in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And there is still the lack of budget for the Fund of the industry association äußer recorded eight: by the state debt stands at around 10 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a shame from the ethical and moral position that the government is not the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to preserve the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of needs ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, because of the fear to the old cinemas has decided to make these through an agreement between the Community and to protect the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy, the aim of the traditional cinema to protect and support, both in the historic centre, and in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Under the previous measures are also seen before tax Bevorteilungen for the Kinobetreiber and benefits to the public on the transport: it will be allowed in the traffic limited areas of the centre and also to travel to lower Parkgebühren to park. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "It is a welcome initiative, as Giuseppe Tornatore, '' I hope that other cities will follow our lead and, moreover, still new approaches. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Of course but we also need a better audio and Videoausstattung against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle can achieve anything, because it is the audience of today demanding. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defence of the traditional cinema for me is always an important issue: the closure of the '' by Supercinema Baghiera, place of my childhood and youth, was the pivotal point which brought me to the "Cinema Paradiso" nuovo, even though I have for 10 years had played with the idea. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years, I live in Rome; when I look at the Rialto or the Quirinale vorübergehe in the via Nazionale, where I saw so many different emotions, I try to the side, so as not to see the staubbedeckten posters. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea to win for 70 years, is already being investigated and take into consideration; not by coincidence more vigorous these studies since the first oil crisis significantly. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the price of oil in 1980 vergas to slow the idea of marine energy, but now pressing the environmental organisations and the increase in the price of oil on new impetus in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The World Energy Council (WEC) in London, estimates that 15% of the world's energy of the energy produced by the ocean waves could be covered. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This is double the energy produced by nuclear reactors at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="8"> What would come in addition to the currents and tides. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Giants in the attack. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The first company, now on the marine energy, is Enersis in 2005 a treaty for the construction of a power plant in the north Portugal has signed. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step to act. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Two years later, there are now more firms from the traditional energy industry, which for the marine energy production. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Chevron examines these technologies" as the spokesman of one of the American giants well-known company in the Wall Street Journal the possibility and will cooperate with us. " </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is the creation of a licence from the American energy Commission needed a project to launch off the coast of Alaska. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is a not to be underestimated sign, particularly when you consider that just continue to fuel in Alaska is promoted by the United States and President Bush recently even the plans for new Bohrungen set in motion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant power Inc. from New York and Ocean power from New Jersey who invest in the new industry. Are also not familiar with the details, but observers speak of a rising interest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Still leaves technologies. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Experts speak of a departure was still in the adoption of technology, not least because there is not yet the last doubt from the environmentalists are clarified. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So far, projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland seem rather small dimension and no serious ecological causing problems. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, we need technologies with far greater impact on the environment. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There are various possibilities: Ocean power around uses a system of related Bojen. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The boost of the waves, which moved up and down, Bojen within the swimmer will magically appear on Kolben and converted in hydraulischen pressure. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This drives a Turbine, which in turn is pursuing a generator. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The electricity will be on the coast under water pipes. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Until now, there are four planned plant of its kind, which is still waiting for permission to the state. A part of its energy could also serve for military facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> However, Verdant power produced already energy for a Warenkaufhaus and a Parklatz through unterseeischer turbines in the East river from New York. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The water movements during the tidal forces turbines in which the emerging Drehbewegung feeds the generator. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to the Verdant waiting for a long queue of potential clients on the necessary Autorisierungen in order to make use of this energy sources. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But the waves, then the tides. </seg>
<seg id="30"> A particular interest, according to the Institute deserves the potential for stromgewinnungs research at the moment, which in the tides. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Even though it is a phenomenon, unregelmäßiges are extremely unpredictable, but better than the tides, the sun Windströmungen and also of the waves, and therefore a trust more worthy source of electricity. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is the tidal energy, it is the federal states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal States, have already expressed about 7.5 million dollars to invest in 2008 for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned. </seg>
