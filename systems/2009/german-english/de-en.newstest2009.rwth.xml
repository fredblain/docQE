<seg id="1"> Duel on a knife edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We advise you to your appointment </seg>
<seg id="3"> While nearly every cell phone MP3-Dateien are unfolding, not MP3 players use. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Why is, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Despite this, there are plenty of reasons why a stand-alone player should gain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The election depends on the type of use and the challenges of the future owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Sure you buy it for home a splendid expensive Plattenspieler order the latest album from Boycko Turbulenc to listen to. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Even seem such musical items not on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Have you LPs with type rock, jazz or blues shelf, dream you probably at least by one. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It is also the music on trips, with condensed music, simple - music in MP3-Format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here too there is price and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For the one hand, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player eight thousand kronor, as we will be a Pink-Floyd-Fan hard pressed headphones for twenty kroner market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes, between which everyone enough space. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The selection is vast. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Also the lifespan of the batteries is crucial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good music player can very much more than just music, but what can mobile phones, they do not even hints. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern equipment is as universal as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Besides the primary functions, the cost and the Simsen, cannot be it music and videos, both, it has a better, or worse camera and can perhaps also. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if you add the Smartphons and communicators, it was almost a small computers in the bag. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a minor miracle, because no fridge can grillen and no television taking photographs. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of the mobile phones also disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more responsibilities you on your cell phone use, the more often you will but it nachladen must. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And that music is one of the largest energy. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only a few mobile phones can music longer than zehn-zwölf hours, most of it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this respect are Music player (especially the simplest) significantly more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> You should therefore cheap count mobile phones to expect that they will no longer than a few hours of music. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you then and still telephone, buy the safety prefer a Ladegerät scarred for office - which also applies to more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of plant with a time loading. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem is, if it wants to ignore the music on mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment on a USB-Abschluss, also does not support any mobile phone without special software directly to a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course, cannot ignore the music directly to a storage medium means, but only a few Kartenlesegeräte will without reduction with the tiny Speicherkarten ready, which are used in mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> In players need you to exceptions (iPod) no special software. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need to feed the device only USB-Port with music from your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile phones and player conduct itself a Musikbibliothek to, according to the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the Genre or the assessment by users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices are the only Baumstruktur of the Adressverzeichnisses onwards, similar Windows Explorer, some of them both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Players are easier to use mobile phones can more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The selection of a specific piece of equipment you should the lifespan of batteries, the storage capacity, ask the quality, and the type of Klangs and of course the Bedienkomfort inquire. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For music above all, and you hear it every day only briefly in the trams, then any mobile phone, is the MP3-Dateien. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What can really almost every cell phone. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They must not check, what Musikformate a mobile phone or a player can deal with. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 create all, and most of the music, which you receive, will be in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format is one of the most widely disseminated, and also the most equipment also music in WMA-Format taking place. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Less is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better mobile phones allow online also buy music. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One need only on mobile Internet the pages of a Providers (or any other provider), and it can be a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service can already in and of itself clincher, be it a Musikhandy should gain. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately this is offering the service providers and confined mostly only on quick Radiohits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are not the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In general, but the assumption is that this is exactly the sort of music (on GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) will dominate in the music industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> The mobile phone, the most itself. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you want to listen to something, you after the mobile phone in the expected, while the player forget is at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> However, it is important to whether your headphones or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung carry. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, can you use the integrated loudspeakers, on the almost every mobile phone, but only the MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Perhaps the biggest benefit of the Musikhandys will for many on price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three and four thousand kroner get you a decent Walkmans. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest handicap will be for the majority that are not normal headphones. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and technically ausgereiftesten telephones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphone cost up to fifteen thousand kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the player is in the restaurant. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (selection) - player can each. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of functions, the similarity in the restaurant with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or the Plattenspieler is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There is no collision in the form of a mistakenly salaried mobile Internet and then exorbitant bill for data transfers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> The device should now take </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> Also the cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) usually have a Slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if nachkaufen you a karte nachkaufen, rich two thousand kroner. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But beware. </seg>
<seg id="67"> In the Basismodellen be supported in the rule only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive can read 8-GB-Speicherkarten read. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 players, you then attack after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you will have not more than 1100 kroner on the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> You are among the more demanding transmitted, you prefer to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). </seg>
<seg id="72"> These devices have independent Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and the Bedienkomfort comes as to the one MP3-Players regurgitating them. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual providers is already this year in the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite perfected, the Czech providers offering virtually all the services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> But what is missing here - a virtual providers, of the classic to lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps this will not be long in coming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For the Czech mobile phone operators to the most expensive in Europe, we have also often on Mobil.cz reported. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, who pointed out that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the final steps of the European Commission in regulation of roaming charges it is as likely to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators will text message from the Ausland be cheaper than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe are so high? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, there is the competition, which really is a challenge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it sounds paradoxical in Czech, there are three mobile networks and a Penetration of far more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile phone operators rant gladly, however, that it on the Czech market much competition. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The share is often the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, the often expressed in the past, that there was no place in the Czech Republic for another supplier. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is likely that not a classic providers with their own network so many opportunities (would find it probably hardly frequencies). </seg>
<seg id="15"> But there is still a possibility - a virtual providers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The entry of virtual providers on the mobile phone market brought a strong price reduction, in which had then take the traditional mobile phone operators. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There was even before the advent of such firms such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain similar votes as in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, it turns out that it for such providers place and that they can be successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Incidentally, needs to not long after examples. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In just half a year it turned the supplier, more than 100 thousand customers to win and for fünfgrößten providers in the country. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, the Czech Republic, among other things, U: fon possesses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual providers is, therefore, that much more specific target group. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to function effectively, need virtual providers much less customers as a classic providers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They need not relatively high costs for construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world are joining the virtual providers are usually seen as Low-Cost-Firmen heraus - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which, often from a less extensive service Leistungsangebot begleitet wird. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Providing such as Tesco Mobile in Britain SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As demonstrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move, not to put on a klischeehafte target group. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Those suppliers is: specifically to men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "True just choose Mobilking - the supplier who they like and whom they can trust," David Seibert, the chief executive of the Mobile entertainment Company, the company this virtual prey. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It's hard to say whether it would take a similar concept as in Poland, Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Doubts also the official press Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is a market segment in which the most virtual providers, relatively small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It is from the perspective of the service Leistungsangebots relatively saturated. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic a chance, my mobile telephone providers </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile phone operators conquered the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We talk about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations were not hope. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It will be more of a market entry of Mobilking in other countries in our region, "he says in a phone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, Pressesprecherin the financial group Penta. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly confirming it so that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic this idea. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that there is not a potential competitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Their interest in a launch of a virtual Mobilfunkanbieters shows for some time, the group GTS Novera, which would like to take a further step, in order to be a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area Firmenkunden. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have an interest in our customers not only fixed, but also Mobilfunk-Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen to offer. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the sooner the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> This possibility we have negotiated repeatedly with all Czech incurred by customers. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Some of them we have already negotiating progress, "the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps now better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> With no official information that is expected to be the first virtual providers perhaps by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> But is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "At this moment, we do not imagine that, in the Czech Republic for a full virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market points to other markets big specifics. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Has contacted us yet no subject with a complex and serious project in this area, "says in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> For the specific nature of the Czech market also include other providers. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The Pressesprecherin of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement of O2 added: "So far we have not yet viable and mutually advantageous project, which could continue building." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And adds: "In network of T-Mobile will come before the end of the year was hardly a virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At this moment, we would have been have a practical way, in order to think so short term can. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone is its attention more to meet the demands of its own 3G-Lizenz. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav Čepický thinks: "For negotiations with potential virtual operators are we open, particularly in the field division of costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> This is exactly what we see from the perspective of the customers as the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in search of a partner to create a shared network for a fast mobile Internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The competent authorities, with the hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The mobile phone operators is easy to understand, another supplier would be more competition, that would lead to lower prices and also to the profits. </seg>
<seg id="61"> So why should facilitate a competitors from entering the market? </seg>
<seg id="62"> That the providers, when it comes to something, illustrates the long trek to the emergence of U: fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Probably the strongest in ČTÚ was at that time, U: fon came on the market, by society T-Mobile. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It also publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ-Webseiten. </seg>
<seg id="65"> But now stands just U: fon than argument why a virtual providers should not allow. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrová said: "The Konkurrenzumfeld of the mobile phone market was recently by entering the market a fourth Mobilfunkanbieters strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="67"> In light of the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that would include a new player in the market itself and above all his services high demands. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Given this approach the mobile phone operators surprised the absolute lack of Czech regulatory authorities. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is not the attitude of the ČTÚ, in Czech, unfortunately, in contrast to Britain and other developed countries - not the competence in the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Has this exclusively the for the protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> This but referred to this whole issue its very typical attitude. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "Market entry of a virtual Mobilfunkanbieters would then be possible, it is a contract between a mobile phone operators and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> So far there has been no such contract completed, because offering potential stakeholders was probably for the traditional operators not sufficiently interesting, "in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa by the external relations department of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Representatives of the companies would not be surprising, such an approach. </seg>
<seg id="75"> By one authority, which represent the interests of consumers and to make, among other things, that none of his position in the market, this is more than worrying. </seg>
<seg id="76"> In particular, add Kristián Chalupa adds: "In Ausland, where work virtual providers quite normal, is to observe that its market entry to a price reduction in mobile telephone services". </seg>
<seg id="77"> But probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price reduction to the interests of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> Really shocking is in this case the almost touching line the three mobile phone operators, stemming from their reactions. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question of whether it was a coincidence. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Just as the same petrol prices at the pumps sure only by chance and a hard competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "The authority has discovered in this matter no evidence to suggest that a competition; action, and it also has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he has not the appropriate increased responsibility for his actions in the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The tools for opening the mobile telephone market for virtual providers may lack also the regulatory authority for telecommunications, Chalupa in his statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of a dominant position in the market is one of many points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> There are of course an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÚ, after the telecommunications in the view of the economic competition a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> In such a market has of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators a dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Some legal experts but offer a different vision - for access to the market a virtual supplier is always the approval of the network operator. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile phone operators - logically - for its network the monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> That means that he is taking in a particular segment necessarily a dominant position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if this argument not able, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone operators striking resemblance. </seg>
<seg id="91"> This show complaints a number of interested parties (including the society GTS Novera) that they are in negotiations with all providers in very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The drain on the ČTÚ is in telecommunications services a fairly common trick, the ÚOHS by the whole affair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was observed in a number of similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately, it is not in the recently decided to amend the legislation expanding the powers of the ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts from an improvement in the situation had promised. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives of the ÚOHS know only too well, but probably they have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It is, if nobody watching </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Unseen until the operation of any pseudovirtueller providers, of which there are in the Czech mobile networks several. </seg>
<seg id="98"> There are companies that spend their own price lists for mobile telecom services, which are only partly publicly. </seg>
<seg id="99"> It is usually because firms operating in the area Multilevel-Marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price lists companies arrive normally only to select. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter is that the company with the operators as a classical Firmenkunde occurs, the orders a large amount of SIM cards. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As important customer he then special price offers (and other services). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem is that the conditions of all Czech operators a similar sales ban. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "If there are some cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions, we will be dealing with it, which can lead to a break-up of cooperation with the society," said Martina Kemrová to our question on this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> But it is unlikely that gets something in the upper echelons of the mobile phone operators. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Particularly in the case of the three mentioned firms can be thousands of customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator resists, however, such an approach. </seg>
<seg id="109"> From the activity of these firms spent they forgettable profits, it - unlike the real virtual suppliers - not through the official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> Potential problems is Miroslav Čepický closely: "The law allows these types of speculation, despite all the service companies, only a very small percentage of customers. </seg>
<seg id="111"> This must accept that the SIM-Karte in her telephone not on their behalf, so they can not reason as ordinary customers of the mobile phone operators ". </seg>
<seg id="112"> That alone but should be the ČTÚ strange to say the least. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> Besides an issue for the ÚOHS. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The mobile phone operators in this way, why are they against a virtual providers? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It added that the ÚOHS for detecting such activities fairly strong powers, and if they do not, it must not with the statement of the providers, they know nothing about it and its business conditions it is prohibited,. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When the Czech Republic more at is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As the text has already been said, the market virtual providers a sharp price drop in the various services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Have practically in all countries, where virtual providers, the traditional operators tried, which virtually more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The arguments were virtually identical - a small, or very gesättigter market, problems with the quality of services, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In advanced countries but, in these moments, the regulatory bodies, not the interests of the mobile phone operators, but to keep trying to their customers. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Whether through formal or informal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator, and this was followed by further. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, throw the Czech regulatory agencies throughout the case like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Based on our experience we can help get rid of that uncertainty over the powers in these cases is good. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> But we will be throwing in the towel none. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background and soon a virtual providers, will be the Czech mobile market may soon moving again. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual Mobilfunkanbieters leaves the ÚOHS not remain inactive, wenn es darum geht, further interested parties reject (to discriminate against). </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs will stop expensive phone than the rest of Europe. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In words lacking in the letter from the WestLB-Vorstands to the staff of the House. </seg>
<seg id="3"> By a bringing units of the Düsseldorfer money Institute with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank "could be the central Kapitalmarkthaus the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", it says on Monday revealed letter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The WestLB would be a "Kompetenzblock" with sustainable profitability in such a deal. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And could such a link the future Bündelungen in Landesbankensektor be. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> So reads it wants to demonstrate a governing board at a difficult time to act. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Because the folding WestLB remains under tremendous pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Finanzdienstleistung supervision, which has made it clear the nordrhein-westfälischen country government recently, pushing the time to find a solution for the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> From a as any link between the Deka-Bank, the Sparkassenkunden because of their Investmentsfonds know, and the WestLB is for some time - also in Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although has told Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas during the presentation of the Halbjahreszahlen end of August, in a merger of the House to the Mainzer highway with a Landesbank, around the Helaba or WestLB, he would make no sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But the Board of the Deka, which is half from each of the state banks and the Sparkassenverbänden, asked the board, with the WestLB talks on joint business activities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This could be the Kapitalmarktgeschäft or parts of it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The talks have yet, as it says on financial centre, only just begun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> By the Deka-Bank who, with their 3,000 staff to more important employers on financial centre of Frankfurt, is not the first time the speech, when it comes to consolidation in Sparkassensektor. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 2003 it looked for a moment that would merge the Deka-Bank with the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This Dreierbund was nothing. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hardly had plans became public, the Hessische Land government against the Helaba about. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The two other houses were not there. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But it has repeatedly thought through a combination of Deka-Bank with regional banks. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Least had, however, Günther Merl, CEO of the Helaba, spoke out against overstatement about a rapprochement with his house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Regardless, it seems to mature, but the knowledge that a pattern to the various houses of the public sector is needed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Now that the Landtagswahl in Bavaria is over, could begin connecting the BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg radical. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba this is not necessarily good news. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Should increase the pressure to further mergers, they are the after partner for. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south would only junior partner, although she has i.e., the financial crisis so far, far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A rapprochement with the West LB has the well catered Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with 85 percent of the Helaba is involved, at the beginning of the year. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If anything, the North LB. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Such strategic considerations but only one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the other, there is the question of how the different business models of individual houses with each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June, said Merl, the crucial question, which should ensure business model the Zukunftfähigkeit of the regional banks, was not answered by Germans catered and Giroverband hitherto. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> In the end may also be a dismantling West LB, which is not, however, of course. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Indeed, in the letter of the boardroom, it will be a "solution" for the house. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> A rat or a Schabe is fleeing in danger, that means that they fear felt? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: much animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Only as we could see whether they feel the same way, if they do as we do? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Internetzeitschrift "Edge" has been going on for several years contributions certain famous scientists published. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Mirror ONLINE presented in a series of specific answers to the question "What do you think true, without having to prove it?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I believe that animals feelings and other Bewusstseinszustände have without that I or anyone else, that is where we are not even able to prove that other people. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But in this case must we hope, at least since all human brains same Grundkonfiguration landmark. </seg>
<seg id="9"> When we checked other species and the questions of sensitivity or general awareness of touch, we impassable terrain, because the hardware disagree. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat is at risk, it is the same as many other animals: she is dead, retreats or addresses. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People behave similarly, which some scientists on a comparable subjective experience. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This, however, I do not believe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of the Gehirnstruktur make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> One close the almost always with human consciousness associated some lateral prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the speech, and the Ausführungs- / management functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This broad region is developed in humans is much higher than in the other primates and seems to be in other creatures. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge who we are, and to the ability to decide, there is reason to believe that differs, Man from the other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another dramatic character is in the nature of the human: that is such a large part of its Erlebens with language, it is often said, that was it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But even if conscience of language would be, this would certainly affect, animal awareness, as well as it may be, probably very of most of our Bewusstseins-zustände unterschiede. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It is hard to identify, as awareness among other animals may be. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If, as something that meeting and odour, neither measure yet, because of the specific hardware, from our own experience analyse, presents his research into major problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of awareness, which will be scientifically more easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We could study the Bewusstseinsprozesse of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the like of primates, especially in the visualize,. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick incidents, more likely to be on the neural Korrelate of consciousness than for the casual mechanisms: both may be identical or not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly, stressed this approach the importance of the prefrontal cortex to the visualize,. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What is for the sentiments? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I put them back that activated an emotional system such as the fear in his own activity deliberate brain activated. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we call a "fear", is the mental condition in which we find ourselves if the activity of the brain lokalisierten defence system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) Arbeitsspeicher self-justifying. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So are tied sentiments closely with the regions of the cortex, the primates, and especially the people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Combined with the linguistic nature are subtle gradations of it, because we cannot distinguish and categorize the words and grammar, at only among ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> This means, for example, Antonio Damasio, that feelings from pre activities in the Körpergefühlsregionen of the cortex and the Hirnstammes emerge similar Jaak Pankseep, but more to the Hirnstamm concentrated. </seg>
<seg id="32"> As this network over the course of human evolution not very changed, there could well gattungsübergreifenden sentiments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Theory I cannot disagree, but I think it unbeweisbar. </seg>

<seg id="7"> To close the achievement gap, Obama Bildungsplan specifically among other bilingual footnote in the training for those English only learn English. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But there is the question to Obama about his commitment to the bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, to reduce the gap in the performance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Take, for instance, "Sixth Street" In, "a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The majority of pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of the students, many of which have only recently in the country are, learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But in 2008 a staggering 100 per cent of pupils in the fourth category of the Staatsprüfung in math on a good footing. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprising were 93 per cent of children from the fourth school year in the Englischprüfung evaluated as such. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This astonishing success was achieved with other methods, than those who are favoured by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school Sixth Street a specific focus on verification and exercise, to steady control of knowledge and an attitude which tolerates no exceptions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The case, the school's approach, which the training in an English-language surroundings. This is precisely the point to note the Obama, the Schulleiterin Linda Mikels. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach sets great store by almost ausschliesslichen use of English in Fachunterricht. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mrs Mikels, which the idea of bilingual education, said to me, the school had a remarkable success with a pupil who was only about from Mexico. 12 months later would deny the schoolroom enter and not be able to identify. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It works," said, "it works for us". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Would Obama a school such as the "Sixth Street" In "as a model for other schools with great proportion of Latin American and other English learning pupils? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The school would make the answer to this question, but the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support has long been the idea of bilingual education), and his own unstinting support for the bilingual education make predictions about Obama's response. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The point, that immigrants English should learn, he has recently the subject trivialized, he said, that people should stop worrying about the "only English" any legislation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, he said: "They are designed to ensure that your child Spanish". </seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tucked away between the excesses of recreational parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, noisy and huge type, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of Afro-amerikanischen culture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the city Zora Neale Hurstons, is not as simple as Hurston it in 1935 did, "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown hide, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays it is a Pilgerstätte. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Did intend festival in Eatonville come of the most famous author the Harlem Renaissance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And yet is and remains the city, the describes - and it made to a Touristenausflugsziel, calling them in the Florida tour guide, which was produced for periods of depression by Bundesschriftstellerprojekts produced - in many ways the very particular kind. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eatonville is so independent, overall and privately how in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused their true thoughts with the weissen Mann to share, "so little about the rest of us know that he does not know what he escapes." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, called on open conversation about Rassenverhältnisse, there are so many here, watched by Aussenseitern to be. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "We are very anxious as our history being told," Hortense Jones, 59, from birth, a resident of the city and Gemeindemitglied the oldest church in the city. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must be true. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville was defined for a long regarded as paradox of triumph and the fight. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly allowed inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a stronghold of literature and an example of change - sometimes sentenced, sometimes touted - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in the American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not surprising that people here both proud and wary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And so began the concerns about Eatonville '’ s image with Zora, as all Hurston mention. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was the world their hometown in books, in the of my heart and written in written, as "Mules Advice and Men" (1953) and "old eyes were watching God" (1973) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five paragraphs in the Floridareiseführer modified the city, the very close to the route 77, leads a road through the oft-vergessene centre of Florida, to the scene of black history and human drama. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Insolent as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston reader to the shop by Eatonvilles inaugural mayor, Joe Clarke, and was then privateren Affairs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Margins of the road on the left," she wrote, "the brown -weiss angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and Spielplätzen for always Howard Miller, even though he cannot read and write." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> They also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks all sold and was-auch-immer to Stundenzimmern fits." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In only a few hundred words brought Hurston therefore Eatonville with self-government in, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was certainly no tour guide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In fact, this was not a Portrait, that all of you. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "Zora described the things as they were," the 90-year old made Dinkins, one of the Johnson-Mädchen the Hurston offers, by the men,, quoted the songs on their beauty sang, the full sexual innuendo. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They added: "The people disliked." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> We remember here still Hurtson than a lively Exzentrikerin, which returned regelmässig, after her family after Jacksonville, Florida was drawn. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if Hurston in the city gebraust came, they usually without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, rauchend and with trousers, in a city which today in its venerable clothing style straightforwardly. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Mr Franklin were the most populous fascinated, whereas many of you despise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "Were always glad Zora to see," said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But "it was never too long," he said he added during in his chair schaukelte, on a back home terrace, on the Sabelia sea, in which the Hurston all likelihood baptized was. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As Hurston in 1960 died was avidly poor and their books. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Together with the bulk of the world seemed to forget Eatonville they have. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although they once a famous author, was a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman sitting at Barnard College in the 1920ern, it was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eatonville there were no ceremony, no public readings. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "I do not think that they their contribution in the world or its heritage in the least understood," Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography on Hurston the was published in 2003. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The turning point came in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city, the Kennedy Boulevard to replace, the slow two-lane main street of the community. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlandos suburbs already had the motorway 4 through the western edge of town. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The proposal was presented as Eatonville itself still of a difficult phase in its history, rebounded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Forced integration, among other things, gave the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing hatred in the community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "At this time was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and toys on the sidelines in front of people," said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "There was even a woman who was killed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> They threw a Wassermelone from the car. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In 1955 hinterfragte Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the Supreme Court, integration, giving them their decision in the case of Brown against the Schulrat as "insulting instead my race respektierend." </seg>
<seg id="46"> Residents say today that although the lifting of racial segregation in some respects, was positive, it's the Gruppenzusammenhalt in Eatonville and self-assurance of its young people influence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> "Black children were used to it, hugged to be - I remember - we embrace his teachers in the morning and you embrace your teacher at night," N. So-and-so Nathiri, daughter of made Dinkins and Managing Director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville Community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> This could be as long, she added, by teachers and pupils no longer from the same place. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "We embrace his white teachers, because he was a white teachers - I think there is a cultural gap exists," said Mrs Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> But the civil rights that was created room for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who transcended itself on prejudices transcended, as they did, with positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How can refuse any joy my society deny! </seg>
<seg id="51"> I do not understand it. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In 1975, the novelist Alice Walker on the path to Hurstons nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of their glory. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Five years later was a much praised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. Hemenway in the Bücherregalen to find, and made it back to part of the American Literaturkanons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The Fernstraßenprojekt just at a time, was published in the Eatonvilles most famous single daughter once again in the public eye. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And this time saw Hurstons old neighbours as Retterin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The town began in 1988 with the construction of a Hurston festivals to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January put many for the celebration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> A few years later wrote the district of his Straßenbauplänen. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "The plans a fünfspurigen highway crowded the city, accelerated the whole thing with top speed, gave real Bürgerstolz," said Mrs Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Mrs Boyd Wenzhong put it somewhat easier, "Zora saved Eatonville." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the Fernstraßenprojekt has contributed to change the image of the city. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There were more and more Zugereiste, just as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who is since 1993 in the Church, and residents began to appreciate the past. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eatonville in 1998 in the nationwide historic register. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new einstöckige library (named, of course, after Hurston) opened in 2006 at the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy Boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Today is Eatonville remains for a feature in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can sometimes anfühlen as a Hintergasse in summer rain, as small as the time when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880ern. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (It is now up to 90% black.) </seg>
<seg id="67"> Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are often still treated with caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most of the interviews is an approval in advance and certain things - just as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest Church, by a Weissen painted and black men in the field of work - must not be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a penchant for Dunkelrot, still fear that their secretive community misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And yet, at the same time the Hurston-Festival larger, was also a greater degree of Heimatstolz born. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Young people in particular tend Eatonville to see how Hurston their whole race saw: so beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and proud, creative, and hardworking, silly and mixed as any other racial and Völkergruppe in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It is the sincere love for this town in the voice of Mr Franklin nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to after Eatonville to returning in the town council or to the police to work, which according to him a little aid could use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even the relatively young, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter Park, have learned that Eatonville correctly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> "Most people on the road, only here, will think, 'Well, this city is nothing compared to the other," said Alondra Kenon other day on Sunday after the church. </seg>
<seg id="75"> "But if you stop and look at for a moment of its history, it is a very nice city." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós, is José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous uprising of Spaniards against the French, which is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with about 15 million investment for the Dreharbeiten. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In this way has tried the Cineast tried a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he had always admired to the sites of the famous novel writer admired, said today Carci in the presentation of the cinema with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> "Sangre de mayo 'with a Filmlänge of more than two-and-a-half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later at the station Telemadrid than a four-hour Miniserie shown. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> José Luis Garci, a big fan of the literature of Galdós, assured us that this Dreharbeit his' Kindheitstraum 'came true, he can thank Esperanza Aguirre, who gave three years ago by the autonomous community in Madrid, to a Gedenkfilm to second Jahrhundertsfeier on 2 November in Madrid, particularly because the story on the basis of' Episodios Nacionales' is based, the mission. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The total of 15 million, which was contested by the autonomous community in Madrid for Dreharbeiten, offers Garci, as he ever has, the unique opportunity 'with polite and clothing that image of the "distraught Spain, which aussuchte the wrong leader for the fight, because the people in the fight for the independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII in arrears had been present. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But regrets the Cineast, if the funding as' Alatriste 'or' Los fantasmas de Goya (twice as high as in 'Sangre de mayo') have not been able to count, why were some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with the Garci almost his whole career working, not made. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For this reason, has Garci, who also Filmdirektor in 'Volver Wyatt empezar' was, by his own operation involved: he went to the scene to the actors, with whom we first rehearsed must before you start to swing and for those who do not Casting felt had seemed he 'humiliating' and respect verschaffend, 'part of the profession of the Filmdirektors consists, aid in theatre and cinema, in order to know what is in the cinema industry, in which they work, is happening.' </seg>
<seg id="9"> Many performers, he in 'Sangre de mayo' faces, must reiterate his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos ’ or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Garci, Oscar-Kandidat in four nominations (of which he has won a), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates, who this year Spain before the Academy of Hollywood, represents a new generation of Spanish Filmographie represents. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', "Siete mesas de billar francés' and not the film Los girasoles ciegos'. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For this film expected Garci no awards. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "In the beginning I bet you that you arbeitest for the descendants arbeitest, later merkst you discover that it is only for continued health is, and you are now satisfied, while a film has produced," said Garci after more than 30 years of work. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Conversation - From blood that safe again was </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema-quebec fêted yesterday the 10th anniversary of its founding and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And, above all, it has the confidence of the public reclaimed by the scandal by contaminated blood in the 1980's and 1990's shaken. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As we know, were contaminated by the Blutspendendienst of the Canadian Red Cross managed national Blutreserven during the 1980's with HIV and hepatitis C virus. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Given this tragedy and public discontent led the Canadian Government in February 1994 a public, the judge Horace Krever Khare investigation, which aimed to bring light into the circumstances which led to this tragedy, and, in order to prevent another disaster of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While reluctant judges Krever still hesitated, his report, then several provinces a committee on its feet, whose goal it was a new system for managing blood in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec, met the committee Gélineau that referral. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the reports of Gélineau and Krever were founded in Canada two blood banks created: Hema-Quebec, which for Quebec is responsible, and the Canadian Blutgesellschaft, the other provinces and the two territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> '1998, as has Hema-Quebec their work, had hardly had 38% of people confidence in the Blutkonservensystem in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was disappointing. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Through the enormous efforts to ensure the safety of the blood to improve and work in this area over the following years, we have the confidence of the public regained ", she says, before they are proud that early 2008 now almost 94% of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema-Quebec had. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr Décary but retains, knowing that 'trust is something extremely fragile'. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its founding on 28 September 1998 is Hema-Quebec following the principle of caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At this time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new kind of CJD, told this woman, who has since its inception in 1998. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And we had no idea whether there could be transferred this disease by blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So we invoked one of the Hauptrichtlinien of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to one Ausschlussmaßnahmen applies Ausschlussmaßnahmen, if it does not know and when a disease only slowly, as it appears in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So, in April 1999 no blood of people who had immigrated since 1980 longer than a month in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, a few years ago, has been without doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So has shown us the event that the principle of caution that we could well meaning. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999 he appeared on the market a lot more technology to detect HIV: the Nukleinsäure-Tests (NST), which directly in the blood of the donor the existence of the virus itself, and not the antibodies against the virus, as it did in the hitherto tests. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST allowed it to shorten the incubation period, between the time the has been infected person and, if it can be found to be the first viruses through our techniques in the blood, the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So was the risk that it could be infected some donors, without knowing it, could not see and this, considerably reduced. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion, to reduce. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Today is one of 12 million people in danger, with HIV infected blood. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "In other words, that means that 12 million blood distribute, before would be infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Since distributed Hema-Quebec every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood, it would take more than 24 years, before a case, was the HIV on a Blutkonserve transferred. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that we now feel can, if a blood transfusion gets or the health to restore ', the head of Hema-Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Our challenge for the next ten years, it is the safety of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows what pathogens into the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year is in Reunion, the Chikungunya-Virus appeared, which, as the Westnil-Virus, is spread by insects on the blood. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must constantly monitor ', Dr Décary continuing before they emphasised that must Hema-Quebec alongside a safe supply a sufficient supply available. </seg>
<seg id="33"> 'The growing demand, because the population is getting older. </seg>
<seg id="34"> There are the treatments for cancer aggressively, need patients often new red blood cells or platelets. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The aging of the population is also affecting the Blutspendernetz from, where on average only 3% of the donations appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> Can any healthy people, the 18 years or older is and meets the eligibility criteria, all 56 days, six times a year, give blood. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On average 14% of the people, their blood available to, not because they are sick of AIDS or malaria, visited and who, in a country that is prevalent in the malaria, will be excluded for one year by blood donations. </seg>
<seg id="38"> "With these 3% to keep an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Lack of stockpiles are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But we must change the members of this Spendernetzes renew as they grow older and can give blood. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and to encourage them to be regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Life is now so hectic that rarely take the time to spend an hour in donations', regrets Mrs Francine Décary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of 297 million dollars is not Hema-Quebec only blood, but also human tissues, including Knochentransplantate, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, which is used almost exclusively for serious fire violations. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These tissues are being analysed, processed and frozen before they Hema-Quebec be stored, which administers the only public Nabelschnurblutbank of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord, which had been regarded as biomedical waste, stem cell rich blood, which can help, serious diseases such as leukaemia, to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "A few weeks ago, we celebrated the stockpiling our thousandth Nabelschnurblutprobe, and we plan every year more than buy a thousand lessen. </seg>
<seg id="47"> 'We should probably early next year begin, for transplants to provide ", explained Dr Décary further, this programme of Nabelschnurblut- abnahme describes as very popular. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "Many mothers are convinced no such access to have ', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals of Quebec. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Free - the Orwellian speech by Barrick gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In its edition on 17 September, Le Devoir a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vize-Generaldirektor the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms, and followed a nineteen logic, that the greatest Goldgewinnung society in the world a libel case over six million against three authors and a small mittelloses publishing house was, with the goal being a 'public transparent plastic debate' to open. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then do not judge them on the truth, especially in the case of libel lawsuits, but above the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expected, this fundamental difference was concealed by Mr Garver completely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For Barrick gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, in the ruin, who dares, one of the its opposite views. </seg>
<seg id="7"> No matter how the process, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers, who are paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactics in these unequal struggle is often to ruin the defender, to enforce an amicable settlement, which the other side, silence and is also anyone who dares to look again at the question. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If wanted Barrick gold really a public debate, they would have their attitudes from public opinion must present. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In contrast, as in many of the countries in which works Barrick gold, and is, to be played in Canada debates normally through the exchange of ideas and not by Knüppelhiebe. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It would have sufficed, if the gold mine its books and files and have opened a real debate, through the papers, media, publishing and financing independent Prüfteams, the light on this issue could have. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and embraced the petitions and letters of support for the authors by Noir between Canada with a snap. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Perhaps Mr Garver explain, as he simultaneously a 'public' debate may ask and opinions that public scorn? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently includes this word in the world of only the generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very nice beengte vision of the term. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy to speak even detractors the right. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What Barrick gold does not understand - or not understand - is that the general public, which the authors and publishers of Noir between Canada, above all, it is, of course, because they are the brutal attitude of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Public opinion is willing to listen Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in a framework, which many saw as Knebel-Klage (during the 'public debate "has Barrick gold just a request to the authors of Noir between Canada, in which she asked of them, to not use that word more...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the case brought by Barrick gold a direct assault on the freedom to academic research and seek out the truth, which are essential to any democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> They denied the right, credible sources to quote and about facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it a country such as Canada is impossible, subjects to research and discuss the rich companies of this world, who else can this do? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If wanted Barrick gold really a public and open debate, could bring them in line with the scientific standards, which were used by the authors of Noir between Canada. </seg>
<seg id="22"> She has a right to reply. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The university environment to which we belong has long debates and inconsistencies in the and to resolve conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that, contrary to what they claim, in no mood to a transparent debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time that the governments of measures which restrict this sort of undeserved complaints. </seg>

<seg id="6"> As the investigation known, made when the Ausschreibungsgelder fictitious accounts, and the clubs are their duties also failed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to indictment is a large part of the bills have been falsified. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Rechnungsblöcke were on the market by Józsefváros bought, the Rundsiegel it allowed in Kiskunhalas. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The decision, which will be issued firms the bills, was on the trip north from Lake Balaton, was sent to the István Lados of János substrate. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In this "fact-finding tour" should Lados pensions and restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He asked bills on the Konsumationen, later on these proposals based bills for the youth and Sportministerium, social and employment, and the self-governance of Budapest to be. </seg>
<seg id="12"> These bills are mainly by István Lados and his accomplices, have been manipulated András Őri, which is representing our information for the Constitution of those reports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> One of the objectives of Lados' "fact-finding tour" was a Bierlokal. </seg>
<seg id="14"> As two of the contract and is Co in 2003 issued bills, the Gastronomiebetrieb the neunzigköpfige group of associations Biztos Pont Egyesület meal. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The number of those infected will here at home to be treated 100,000, only seven thousand, which is inherent to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Hepatitis is the name for various viruses, infected liver disease. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The symptoms are often similar - Leberentzündung and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Depending on the virus spread the hepatitis viruses on two different species: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D can the viruses through blood and other Körperflüssigkeiten (such as sperm, Scheidensekret or spittle). </seg>
<seg id="7"> Travellers will be recommended vaccination against the viruses A and B, against the virus C, there is no vaccine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The symptoms of hepatitis A show around zwei-drei weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally of Unwohlbefinden, weakness, stomach pain and splutter. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Then comes the jaundice on the skin and in the eyes, the chair is bright, the controller of dark, and the recovery could take up to zwei-drei weeks take. </seg>
<seg id="10"> World dies every year around 1 million people to the hepatitis B infections caused far more serious illnesses such as liver cancer and cirrhosis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The main reason is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients in drug treatment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Also hepatitis C can have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most of the people do not even know about their illness, because the pathogen the liver are destroyed - in many cases show the first symptoms after 20-30 years. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So is early prevention, such as regular inspections, is essential. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There are three groups, in which the disease is more common: those who have undergone before 1991 a blood transfusion, drug addicts, and Tätowierte. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Currently estimated the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide to 200 million. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As latest research suggests that the religious belief as a kind of "pain" overtones, which is already the death Catholic martyrs have facilitated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has influenced the belief in God the Schmerzempfinden of the people affected, the British 'Telegraph ". </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the wake of the more bizarre investigation received every 12 believers and atheists electric shocks, while a painting of the mother of God afterlife. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the results showed, the believers of most of the pain. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A Hirn-Scan technology could even be shown that could activate the Catholics of the part of her brain, who is in charge of the Schmerzregulierung responsible. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The study was the first in a research project, which, as well as scientists also philosophers and theologians from various departments in the university. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The attempt was the subjects a funkelndes equipment at the left hand, the electric shocks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked on two paintings to focus: a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand, Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the sable." </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers had hoped that the sight of young Maria under the believers a kind of religious trance would provoke, while they Vincis picture started because of the other paintings and reassuring was perceived. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The subjects were ever half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received in this period, a total of 20 threats in four stages, while they either religious, or the other paintings should look. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Catholics reported that they had in the mother of God "in security" felt as if they "-", and they would "calm and peace". </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the Betrachtens of religious painting they have reported 12% less pain, as if they had Leonardos opus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias, the also attempt attended, said it could be similar effects with other, strong images also atheists, we should just the photograph. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "We must find a picture that very positive emotions, such as a mother or father," the psychologist. </seg>

<seg id="17"> "Practice of the faith should change our personality, and in many cases," Wright. </seg>
<seg id="18"> After these excellent results the only question is what could effect a Madonna-Bild Leonardos or any other comparable Malers at the Schmerzregulierung of believers. </seg>

<seg id="2"> At its tenth birthday can Google with fair to say that it is in the pockets of the people as to find above their heads in the sky: you know, where the people their holidays, which are specialists they go and what they are. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, the chief executive officer of Google. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the sceptics who of Orwellian nightmare visions be plagued, he hosts: these were just the essence of the Web 2.0. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google, more personal data about users to collect and so the original purpose of the company to get closer to that "all information this world class". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt said Google was after ten years weltverändernder work still only at the beginning of the Informations-Sammelns. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The status quo in five years, "said Schmidt: he wanted, Google would be able to questions like" What can I do tomorrow? "Or" what job fits really to me? "To answer, however, are software programs not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Not all Internet-User are aware that were registered in Internet-Recherchen the Suchbegriffe, and also the IP addresses, from which sought, and the visiting sides. </seg>
<seg id="9"> For example, the two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" allows us to store the visitors his own Suchverlauf and drawing later, that can bring the hit later much more precise and, on the same logic are the so-called "Recommendations," with whom the system tailor-made recommends products and services because of the previous preferences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The users wondering what in the event of a Datenmissbrauchs happens - "If you check what I do" - show some concerned whether the Google-Datenmonopols. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In most cases it is more of the firm, potential power, frightening, and less feeling guilty or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power, with many Internet-Usern of rejection. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, it is a proven fact that stored the Suchbegriffe not only, but instead will be passed on occasion even to third parties, and in these Gesetzesfällen there is no protection for the rights of the Internet-Users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A perfect example was recently against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google the Brazilian government information by the Gemeinschaftssite called "Orkut" were collected and did also identify the Pädophilien possible. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Personal rights was users could breathe a sigh of relief, but in May, as Google together with the Bürgerrechts organisation EFF successfully against the FBI in court: so can be forced Google in future with any of the Constitution, information the FBI secret question. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (However, the federal government successfully the 50,000 Webadressen and 1,000 Suchbegriffen with reference to the years ago adopted Jugendschutzgesetz hydrocarbon, but it was the list of individual users, denied or whose Web- and research on list to two months backdated.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Googles image remains controversial: those who hand over their personal data reluctantly, because they fear by the use of the Google-Dienste the loss of their private and make-up, chastising the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But the American "Geek-Kultur", which, in many countries is present and enthusiastic Computerfans, unites activists and users, the next generation of the "coolen entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which thanks to Windows market leader, even if fighting both at the same goal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> One possible reason is that Google its users, in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and his services are available for free, and that a more open, constantly updated source code and Programm-Package far more attractive, young and cool seem to be, as the official practices of the computer software. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand, says the Geeks the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet caustic - a relationship, especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" is at the core. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The "Web 2.0" is nothing more than collaboration, in other words, the users left deliberately traces and use the available channels of communication and, even if the individual are different, remains the main thing, the same publicly to show. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An ordinary person can simultaneously in several Gemeinschaftsportalen be high profile management - from Facebook on Xanga, can these other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm with each other, and can include all this in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they could lead to blogs, which are the latest Fotogalerien automatically, which are geostet on Flickr or Picasa geostet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a number of other classic cases shows: that if the Partyfotos to last night's the girlfriend soon, with whom it disloyal friend Bush-bashing has, or will be, because he makes in his blog too honest his anger at the corporate governance air - one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been completely new. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If you have a Online-Leben, is what he reveal - or less can be given in the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And anyone who tried to keep something secret, or even the Google-Monopol to circumvent, can gladly do that - as with Scroogle, a Tool, the grab at the search engine Google grab, but deliberately no trace. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Many people register not deliberately on Gemeinschaftsseiten, so that they are not accessible, but also the Online-Applikationen of Google, such as Textverarbeitungs- and graphics tools and RSS-Feeds, with alternative versions, which are tied to huge Serverparks and generate not the best profile by users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Public opinion has yet been averted, until Google her up. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With its current value of $156 billion the company even before IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the Werbeflächen of AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenue advertisers, and the faster imported services are not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical observer will find the disturbing polarities, has rejected the directors a protest by the staff, having doubled the price of the company ’ s nursery have been doubled, also said the management, the frequent meals of staff is too expensive, which is as mild against the fact that Google in 2006, the Chinese government even in the knees and was with an agreement agreed that all dissident hits, or those who breach the good taste, filtered out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal rules of the group that will be advertised in advance no new service, but only if it is already available, but could the events of the months and years ahead again some sharply change: while some think, Google's Buch- and Magazinscan- or archiving project have now, that the company soon with the Supreme Court to address, are different because of the "" health "concerned that the calls for a complete Gesundheitsprofils basis of findings, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the fact that Google a genetic database builds, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors the substance, as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian fashion a future in which a man thanks to Google's data chillingly nahbar will. </seg>

<seg id="2"> What would be the best method for development of new technologies for accident avoidance, if not the Hindernis-Sensoren from nature to imitate? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example, the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the CEATEC in Japan was a startling project, in which the Nissan-Ingenieure of Hummeln in the establishing new accident vermeidender systems were inspired. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokyo University has Nissan of Autorobotern foreign-backed built biomimetische system from BR23C, a Mini-Auto, equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In flight is any bee their own, oval "privacy," our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, Produktmanager for Technologie-PR and research development, in the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The line-up of the bee that can see in every direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees, plays an important role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The function of the buzz if ratings, the researchers the idea of the lasergesteuerten Abstandsmessers on. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a slanting of 180 degrees within 2 metres, calculated their distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor on board, of the kollisionsvermeidenden process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The barrier will in seconds Bruchteilen registered, and the Autoroboter alter the course, the movement of bees, is the tyres around the corner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In contrast to previous systems will take place this ploy purely instinctively. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> "If it were not so, might not react the Autoroboter quickly enough to avoid the obstacles here," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory (TRL)" and Autoroboter-Projektes. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must react instinctively immediately, because this technology to the most intimate and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer, within the accidents still as inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And that must be a split second. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had already issued a few days ago, as the Chamber of Deputies against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket of the White House agreed: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in the to punish Wall Street than to save the economy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirmed yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported how divided the crisis in Laufschritt, the Republican Party, the Republican Party the increasingly divided in their old and moderate East Coast-Seele, which the state institutions and the business community and the neo-conservative, "which in Washington, and the financial world hostile reception and particularly in the south and centre of the states electorate. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party owes his rise particularly the voice, I referred to above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This just now is only a small part of the big changes before the current economic earthquake or even already: not only in the United States, even in the West and perhaps even on this, will be affected by these. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In both states, as well as in Europe seems the crisis which has long feared events to speed up what, in these new conditions finally take shape and come to light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the extraordinary renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, means the crisis the decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close connections to the outside and at a huge amount of assets of individuals, who live in one state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means a direct political problem for governments: as it promised the families to do, what a great Wählermasse constitute. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis seems economically globally, political campaign is almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems so itself put to one side and his right to have lost: the obvious proof is given by the EU, which, because of their division into various national and knows international conflicts, a common path to know. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Therefore expect all now with the intervention of their own country; rescue plans, the new rules, and particularly of aid distribution fund: since the crisis increasingly serious, only the US in the economic situation without foreign aid to save. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And apart from the resources they have to use it also this: no two to überwertende preconditions, in what otherwise no international organisation and no market in a similar way use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The new emphasis on the staatlich-nationale element, is in well with the ever-increasing importance, which recently in the economy with a closely related sector in: the territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Paradoxical way it is now, as we were so moved into a networked Gesamtreich to be, in a kingdom of increasingly sophisticated technologies, non-material, realising that at once, as will depend on our future but more and more from the essential material things: water, harvest and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These can be transported, certainly all from one place to the other in the world, but with a narrowly defined piece earth - a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is the one who has such a territory, another, in a ernteertraglosen, lives wasserlosen or from oil free area, have an advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I now turn to the second novelty, but the move. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who territory, who government, who says policy, saying leadership. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In that sense, I think the financial crisis two converging phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand there is the recognition of the need for the prestigious Leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how things. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other hand there is now a wave of indignation at the current leaders, particularly those of the economy, as inadequate and full Schattenzonen increasingly showing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There is a deeper cuts, and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distant, all to a whole class of managers of Western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It seems to find the perception among large sections of the population, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but their Ideenwelt, their way of life, culture in the widest sense of the word, whose salary the majority always as foreign and outdated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand for leadership feeds therefore below a diverse but powerful movement the removal of the leaders and the old political establishment, this translates into unplanned "revolts" of the electorate and sudden change of collective heart condition last time, starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the American politician for Bush (and perhaps also plays the victory of the rights in Italy here). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectuals creditors, some would say its format, more and more communication problems and therefore less representative value on, which in the lower social strata of the West and is driven by the financial crisis deepened and to Überdimensionalität being driven. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Given all this, it would be quite excessive, "the masses". </seg>
<seg id="28"> The eyes but to keep track of is certainly not. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historic cinemas to close because of the beneficiary Multiplexkinos. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "A city with no cinemas is a blind city, as a face no eyes." </seg>
<seg id="4"> This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect as now in the large urban centres, and in the provinces. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of exclusion cinemas, which began with the birth of large Multisaalkomplexe in the periphery, in the long term death Einsaalkino centre. A process that seems not only inevitable and irrevocable, but also a cultural crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Are mostly historical sites reminders, "it is like to lose a friend, which has made it a little streets full of emotion," the director of the film "Japan--devoted Cinema Paradiso" him 20 years ago, Oscar and the high price of Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and whose nostalgia, what it is, in a well for ever lost cinema world to live. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The figures, which Anec, the central Gewerbeverband, speak a clear language: in the last five years have had to reach the vast quantity of 316 traditional cinemas; this bill paid most the lion ’ s share of the cinema in the main cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> To the most affected regions included the Emilia-Romagna with 82 of cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This is evidence that are the main culprits the Multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions, in which there was the largest number of this modern cinema registered: with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy which lists, 81 are both in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The business has developed in an irrational manner," Paolo Protti, the President of the Anec, "it is useful that are also new structures, but is the maintenance of the already exist, because it includes a room in the city, they are not all its habitués willing, instead of the old one Multiplexkino in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And here there is the lack of budget for the fund of Gewerbeverbands äußer eight states: the state's debt burden is 10 million. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a disgrace from an ethical standpoint, that the government is not the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The sector to be, between 16 and 18 million per year of needs ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> What is interesting is the case of Bologna, Italy's first city, which, because of the fears of the old cinemas, has decided that an agreement between the community and the Anec to protect; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to traditional cinemas to protect and support, and both in the historic centre, as well as in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Among the expected measures are also tax Bevorteilungen for the Kinobetreiber and benefits for the audience on the transport: it will be allowed in the verkehrslimitierten areas of the centre to drive and also to lower parking fees to park. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "It is a good initiative," Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that will join other cities our example and further new concepts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Certainly but we also need a better audio and Videoausstattung, in order to facilitate against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle something because, after all, is the audience of more demanding. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defence of the traditional cinemas for me is always a topic: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, place my childhood and youth, was the tipping point that moved me, "'s cinema Paradiso", even though I for 10 years with the idea had been playing. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years, I live in Rome; if I Rialto or on Quirinale in the Via Nazionale vorübergehe, where I saw so many different emotions, but I side on, not the staubbedeckten posters to see. </seg>
