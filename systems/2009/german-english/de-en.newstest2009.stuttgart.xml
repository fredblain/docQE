<seg id="1"> Duel on a knife edge: MP3 player against mobile phone. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We advise you on your election </seg>
<seg id="3"> While it can be played almost every phone, MP3 files to telephone or any MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is of course true that it is better to buy only a telephone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Despite all of this there are enough reasons why we should establish an independent player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The whole election depends on the type of use and the demands of the future owners. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Sure you buy hear is difficult for home a fancy expensive record player, is the latest album from Maxim turbulenc. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Once such musical substance not appearing on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, they have LPs with kind of rock, jazz and blues on the shelf, she dreams probably at least one of them. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It is also expressed with the musicians on tour, simplified with compressed music - music in the MP3 format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here, too, there are price and quality category. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For one thing, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player eight thousand kroner, just a Pinker Floyd fan will withstand but difficult headphones for twenty crown from the market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes, between whom there is enough room for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The selection is vast. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The life of the battery is crucial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good music players can take a lot more than just music, but what can they create mobile not even hints. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern equipment is up as universal as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the primary functions, the telephone calls and the Sims, can again be music and video, both begin, it has a better, sometimes for worse camera and can navigate perhaps too. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if you include the smart Phon and communicators about all portfolios, it was almost a small computer in the bag. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a minor miracle, because none of the fridge can grilled and photographed, no television. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of mobile phones would also bring disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more functions on her mobile phone use, the more often you will need it but to shop. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the place of music is one of the largest energy eaters. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only a few mobile music can be played more than ten of twelve hours, most of the time, it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this respect, music player (especially the simplest) are much more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> That is why they should count on the cheap mobile phones so that they can take no more than a few hours of music. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If they are to make a telephone call and they buy on security still prefer to invite equipment for office - and this applies to more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> With MP3 players they will not have these problems, including the less good for keeping at least 9 hours of continuous plant with a time loading. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem is that if you want to play the music on mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, only a fraction of the equipment has a USB conclusion, also does not join any cell phones with special software directly to a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course, you may be able to play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a handful of card readers will be without reductions with the tiny smartcard, which are used in mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> When players they need to exceptions (iPod) no special software. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need to feed the device only via USB port with music from your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile phones and player to determine a music libraries, ordered after the name of performers, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the assessment made by users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices are only form the tree structure of the address directories, similar to the windows Explorer, some of them both (iRiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Players are using mobile phones can more easily, </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In selecting a specific equipment they need, particularly after the lifespan of artificial, the storage capacity, the quality and type of music back and, of course, also the official comfort. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For them music is above all aid and they hear it every day, just briefly, for example in the trams, then a random phone, as MP3 files. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What really almost every cell phones can. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They must not too much control, what music formats, a mobile phone or a player can deal with. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 all create, and, most of the music, which you receive is precisely in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format is one of the most common and most of the equipment can also be played music in WMA format. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Less customary is a (AAC format that Apple and its iPod use). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better enable mobile phones also buying music online. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One need only look at the relevant page a mobile Internet service providers (or any other service providers), and you can buy a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service may be in and of itself a forceful argument for why we should establish a music phones. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately, the supply of providers is bad, and usually only to quickly radio hits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The price is also not the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In general, however, assuming that this type of selling music was dominate (it on GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) in the music industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Most of the cell phone in. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you have the inclination to listen to something, you pick up the phone in the jacket pocket, while the player forgotten at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> It is important, however, is whether they wear whatever headphones, or at least a wireless free telephone facilities. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker that almost any cell phones, but only a few mp3 player. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Probably the biggest benefit of the music phones will be for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand kroner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three and four thousand kroner they get quite a decent issue. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest handicap most people will find that are not normal headphones. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best technical and appeared ready to test phone with a 3.5 mm opening for standard headphones cost up to five, ten thousand kroner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the player is the easy restaurant. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really any dip. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of functions, the similarities in the restaurant with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the dull game is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There is no collision in the form of a mistaken employees mobile Internet and a subsequent exorbitant bill for data transmission. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Following what devices you should take effect now </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> Even the cheapest mobile phone (such as Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchange of storage media (type M2 MicroSD, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Also, if you buy a ticket, two thousand kroner enough. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But beware. </seg>
<seg id="67"> The base model only tickets are generally supported with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the costliest can read 8 GB memory card. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you already have a mobile phone, and even if there is a cheap mp3 players want to buy, they apply after, Cowon Creativ, Sony, Samsung, iRiver emgeton or. </seg>
<seg id="70"> According to their capacity (Max) 2 GB must not put these things more than 1100 kronor on the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> They are among the more demanding headphones, you prefer specialised cell phone speakers - mans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). </seg>
<seg id="72"> These devices have separate official buttons for MP3, and the official comfort is so to an individual MP3 players. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Most Sony Ericsson, whose cell phone from the succession issue the same user interface, like the sold individually is MP3 player. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual providers comes earlier this year after the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile market in the Czech Republic is fully developed legal, the Czech providers offering virtually all the services, as they are being offered by their counterparts in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, a virtual service providers, which forces the classic at lower prices missing something here. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps it will not wait much longer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> That Czech mobile providers are among the most expensive in Europe, as we have said on many occasions to mobil.cz. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Moreover, the Telecoms Authority ctú, which draws attention to the fact that the price for an SMS confirmed here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the latest steps taken by the European Commission in terms of regulation of roaming charges is as likely to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile operators SMS will be from abroad is cheaper than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How is it that the price in the Czech Republic are compared with Europe so high? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simply because there is the competition which really makes a declaration of war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps sounds it paradoxical, in the Czech Republic, there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile phone operators rant against be pleased that there is on the Czech market extreme much competition. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ctú) Pavel Dvorák, agrees with many who had voiced in the past too, that there is in the Czech Republic, there is no place for another provider. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is likely that a classic providers with its own network no longer has a great many opportunities (incidentally, it would probably be too little frequencies). </seg>
<seg id="15"> But there was still a possibility - a virtual providers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> It is precisely the advocates of virtual reality providers in the mobile phone market has led to a sharp price drop, to respond to the traditional mobile phone operators. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There was before the advent of such firms such as Tesco mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in the UK, a similar vote as in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has been shown, however, that there is room for such suppliers and that this can be really successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Moreover, we need to look not long after. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February we have reported on the start of the virtual providers mobile King in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In only half a year, this supplier to win more than one hundred thousand customers and emerge as the five largest service providers in the country. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind mobile King the financial group penta-, which, in the Czech Republic among other subway: FON. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantages of virtual reality providers stems from the fact that we can concentrate on a much more specific target groups. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to be effective, virtual operators do operate far fewer customers than a classic providers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> You need a relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world as the virtual providers to thrive normally as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> For example, Tesco mobile in Britain SMS offers at least half of cheaper than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As the example of mobile King in Poland shows, however, it may be a good move to bet on a not stereotypes in target groups. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Those suppliers is specifically directed at men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "real guy select mobile King - the providers that pleases you and you can trust," David Seibert, the chief executive of the mobile entertainment company, the company this virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It's hard to say whether a similar concept could take hold as in Poland and in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="32"> There is also the spokesperson of Vodafone Miroslav cepický doubted: "The Czech market that is based on a market segment, for which the majority of virtual operators, relatively small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> He also is saturated from the point of view of the services offered relatively. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic to invalidate the mobile operators my </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> However, it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile operators in the Czech Republic will be conquered, not this mobile King. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We talk about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations are not very hopeful. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It will, rather, come to a market entry of mobile King in other countries of the region, "Jana studnicková, press spokesperson of financial groups penta- says in a telephone conversation on mobil.cz. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly, it confirms that the present mobile operators in the Czech Republic favor this idea not terribly. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they are trying to do everything we can to ensure that no potentially competitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Her interest in a launch a virtual mobile operators shows for some time now the groups GTS Novera who wish to take a further step to be a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in wholesale. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the sooner, the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> These opportunities we have negotiated repeatedly with all the Czech mobile operators. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Some of them we have already managed to achieve progress in negotiations, "the spokesperson of the group Pavel kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps now better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> From no official information indicates that the first virtual operator is to expect, perhaps by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> So far, but it is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "At this moment, we do not believe that there is room for one in the Czech Republic full-fledged virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market shows over other markets big specifics. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Yet there is no subject has raised with a complex and serious projects in this area, "said in his statement on mobil.cz Vlastimil srsen from the press department of Telefónica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> On the specific characteristics of the Czech market providers indicate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press spokesperson of T mobile Martina kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement by O2: "So far we have not yet found any viable and mutually advantageous project, on which we can build." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And she adds: "in the network of T mobile a virtual providers will appear before the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At this very moment, we need to have a specific offer to be able to do so in the short term. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone also focussed his attention on compliance with the requirements of their own 3G licences. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav cepický it says: "for negotiations with potential virtual providers we are open, particularly in the area of the division of costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> This is exactly what we see from the point of view of the customer the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The principal strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities - with the providers hand-in-hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The actions of the mobile phone providers is easy to understand another supplier said more competition, we will be faced with falling prices and this will also lead to a decline in profit. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Why should facilitate so such competitors to enter the market? </seg>
<seg id="62"> For those who can pull in the same direction when it comes to anything, also the long back and forth about the generation of subway: FON. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Probably the strongest pressure towards ctú went out on time, as a subway: Fon came on the market, from society and T Mobile. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The show also publicly accessible information from the ctú website. </seg>
<seg id="65"> But now subway lends itself: FON as a reason why we should not allow a virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina kemrová said: "The competition environment of the mobile phone market have been strengthened recently even by entering the market a fourth mobile operators. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Bearing in mind the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would make of the market itself and, above all, its services high demands. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Given this approach by the cellular providers the absolute lack of interest among the Czech regulatory authorities astonished, however. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is interfering in is not just about the attitude of the ctú in Czech unfortunately - in contrast to Britain and other highly developed countries - not the competence, in the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This is exclusively the Office for the protection of economic competition (úohs). </seg>
<seg id="71"> But those referred to this whole problem throughout his typical attitude. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "The market is a simulated mobile operators would then be possible, after it has come to a contract between a mobile operators and a virtual service providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> So far, no such agreement has been concluded, because the offer potentially interested buyers was probably on the traditional operators not sufficiently interesting, "in his response to our questions kristián chalupa from the external relations department of úohs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Representatives from providers, such an approach would not surprise. </seg>
<seg id="75"> By an authority which is supposed to represent the interests of the consumer and eight, among other things, that nobody abused its market position, this is more than worrying. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Especially if kristián chalupa adds: "abroad, where virtual providers are quite normal, we can see that the market has contributed to a reduced prices for mobile phone services." </seg>
<seg id="77"> Probably, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and the prices are not in the interests of úohs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> It is truly shocking in this case almost touching line of three mobile phone operators that stems from your reaction. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question whether it is really just an accident is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Just as the absolutely same petrol prices at the petrol station is the only chance, and the result was a stiff competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "The agency has discovered in this matter no signs that indicate a competition directed against the trade, and thus also has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the contractors a dominant position, he has also not the appropriate increased responsibility for his actions in the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile market to virtual service providers lack probably also the regulatory authority for telecommunications chalupa ", says in his statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many contentious points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> There is of course an analysis of relevant markets, drawn up by the ctú, following the telecommunications sector from the point of view of economic competition is a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> In such a market none of the Czech mobile operators still has a dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Some legal experts but offer another angle - for access to the market of virtual operators the consent of network operators is always necessary. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile phone providers - logically - for his network's monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Which means that he is in a particular segment necessarily has a dominant position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if one ball but with this reasoning, it should be for the úohs at least a warning that three mobile phone operators do remarkably similar. </seg>
<seg id="91"> However, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned society GTS Novera) proves that they will have in negotiations with all the operators of similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The shifting the responsibility onto the ctú is then in the telecommunications services provided a legal standard ploy which úohs distanced himself from the whole affair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This has been a number of similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately, it has not been implemented, in the recently adopted amendment of the telecommunications legislation extending the competences of the ctú in the fields of economic competition in the telecommunications sector, although a number of experts had promised that an improvement in the situation. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives of the úohs must know only too well, but probably you have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It is, if anyone looks </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Unappreciated remains once the operation of any pseudo virtual providers, of which there is in the Czech mobile networks several. </seg>
<seg id="98"> There are companies that spend their own price list for mobile telecommunications services, which are only partly open to the public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Usually these are companies that are active in the field of multinational level marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Its own mobile phone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, stars life and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price list of these companies will normally just to be selected. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter is that the company's performance against the operators as a classical firms client who ordered a large quantity of SIM card. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As an important customer he then gets special offers of prices (and other services). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem is that the business conditions to ban all Czech mobile operators a similar kind of resale. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "If there are some cases which you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual conditions, which we are dealing with, which can lead to a cessation of work with the appropriate levels of society", Martina kemrová responded to our questions about this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> However, it is unlikely that it spreads in the upper echelons of the mobile operators. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned may be thousands of customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator opposes such an approach. </seg>
<seg id="109"> From the activities of those firms to flow so that they are not inconsiderable profits, at the same time it - unlike the real virtual providers - should not be affected by the real official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> On the possible problems Miroslav cepický points out: "The law allows these types of speculation, despite all the services of the two companies are to be used only by a very small percentage of customers. </seg>
<seg id="111"> This must accept that the SIM card in your phone on your behalf, they could not do so full it as ordinary customers of the mobile phone providers. " </seg>
<seg id="112"> This alone, but the ctú should occur at the very least, strange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> Furthermore, another question arises for the úohs. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The mobile phone operators from such an approach in closing our eyes to this, why they are opposed to virtual service providers? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It should be added that the úohs for detecting such activity has strong legal powers, and if it does not, it must not be limited to the declaration of providers, them unaware and their business conditions would forbid it, satisfied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When the Czech Republic is no longer in the costliest </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As has been said repeatedly, the text of the market entry virtual providers brought a sharp drop in prices in the different services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> In practice in all the countries where virtual providers have arisen, try the traditional operators, to prevent the emergence of practical, more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The substances they use arguments were virtually identical - is too small, or too much saturated marketplace, problems with the quality of services, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In the highly developed countries but intervened at this very moment the regulatory bodies, which tries to safeguard the interests of the mobile phone operators, but their customers. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Whether through formal or informal pressure, you got the first virtual operator arose, and this further. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies to comply with the whole event like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> On the basis of our experience we cannot dispose of the impression that there is confusion over the competence in these cases more than favorable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> Yet we treat the shotgun into the grain. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background information and soon a virtual providers emerge, the Czech mobile market will perhaps soon be moving again. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a service provider does the emergence of a virtual mobile operators, there will not be any discrimination in úohs motionless, when it comes to rejecting, further interested parties (). </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs are not speaking once more expensive than the rest of Europe. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> At big words lacking in the letter of by WestLB ran on to the staff of the House. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Through a pool of unity of Düsseldorf Monetary Institute in Frankfurt Dean banks could create "the central capital market house of savings banks financial groups', it says in the letter on Monday reported. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The by WestLB yield a "skills" block with sustainable profitability in this business. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And any such links could be the decisive impetus to further concentration in the country's banking sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> So it is that if a board wants to demonstrate the capacity to act in difficult times. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Because the wounded by WestLB, remains under tremendous pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only the Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for financial services regulator, which has made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian provincial government recently, the urge to find a future solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Of a sort of link between the Dean banks, the savings banks customers because of its investment funds, and by WestLB has however been for some time - also in Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although Dean bank chief Franz Waas has allowed during the presentation of the six-month figures know at the end of August, in a merger of the house in Mainz roadways with a bank, for example, of Helaba or by WestLB see it does not make sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But the board of directors of the Dean, who will be paid half from each of the banks and the German savings associations, has asked the board to hold the talks by WestLB on joint operations. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It could go to the capital market, businesses or parts of them. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The talks, however, as it says in the financial marketplace, only just started. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Dean of banks, with their 3,000 staff to more important employers in the city of Frankfurt, is not the first time the speech when it comes to consolidation in the banks sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2003 it looked for a moment as the Dean banks with the bank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba could merge. </seg>
<seg id="16"> From these three did not. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hardly had become the plans public, the hessische provincial government against a turnout of Helaba spoke out. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The two other homes were then not each other. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Land Bank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the bank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But it has been repeatedly thought about linking Dean banks with Bank. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Last but not least, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, spoke out against plan game on a combination with his house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Irrespective of this, but appears to raise the realization that a move together the various houses does the public service sector suffering. </seg>
<seg id="23"> After the elections in Bavaria is now past, could get closer than only a combination of BayernLB with the Agricultural Bank Baden-Württemberg. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The pressure to rise further merger to go after her, and after the sides. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the South, it would become junior partner, although she has endured the financial crisis so far, far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A cooperating with the West LB, once again, of the Building Societies Association and Giro Hessen, Thüringen who is involved with 85 percent of Helaba is the beginning of the year, put a stop to this. </seg>
<seg id="28"> There was, if anything, the North lb. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> This geostrategic considerations are however just one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the other hand, there is the question of how different business model of individual houses pass each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June, Merl, said that the crucial question, the business model for the future competitiveness of the country's banks to ensure it was answered by the German Savings Bank Association and Giro so far. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> At the end of a cutting the West LB could, however, there is of course not. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The speech is because in the letter of the Bureau that there will be sought in any case a "global solution" to the House. </seg>
<seg id="34"> How can you bring to a combination of individual entities with the Dean bank under one roof, will tell. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The German banking system is relatively stable, later in the week German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück first. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Just as well that politics, used the word "relative" and even einflocht that the German banking sector will be spared by the crises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Since the weekend, now occurred. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The DAX quoted Munich real estate financier argued Real Estate (HRE) receives shielding a consortium of German banks a billion loan to cut itself off from the turmoil in the markets. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The proceeds, real estate should verzinsen only the part that will take them up. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The money will come from private as well as public banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Backgrounds are loss during daughter Depfa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The state financier had refinanced according to a newspaper report on long-term projects to which he gave money, extreme short-term - which is because of distrust in the markets now no longer possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the first six months of 2008, cash held in reserve for the bank was reduced by 95% to was million, also the capital ratio had given in May from 1.6 to 1,45 percent. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The ongoing earnings and net proceeds from financial transactions fell compared to the previous year period to zero, the proceeds from Zuschreibungen to demands and certain securities and from the breakup of reserves in the lending fell by more than 70 per cent to 5 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> It was only thanks to higher yields from reimbursement of downstream billing costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa groups and for the reimbursement of interest rates after the charges and from the rules of errand for corporations company that yield minus had higher at around 16 percent more moderate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The former state financier had verspekuliert following its privatization in 1990 with first commercial real estate lending, which were eliminated in the Aareal Bank. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because they earned in the classic state financing too little, the DEPFA had committed then stepped up in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects private investors and the state (private-public partnership (PPP) and diversifizierrt internationally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> On the values of the daughter of the real estate should be about to undertake write-offs that have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, to say it quite vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The fact is that the dividend was scrapped. </seg>
<seg id="18"> And in 2007 it had been cut by two thirds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The proceeds, real estate is part of the DEPFA acquisition an important state and infrastructure spending. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is more than other Institute of the refinancing in the interbank market, since it has no client no. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago has dried up lending among banks again, largely because the banks were hoarding liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The proceeds, real estate takes a year for a partial - around 50 billion - the loan portfolio of DEPFA short-term funds to refinance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> After the announcement of the proceeds, real estate, the funding requirements of the group is satisfied with the credit for the foreseeable future, and the company insulated "from the influence of the current largely functioning international money markets". </seg>
<seg id="24"> From other sources that the refinancing by the end of 2009, thanks to the money saved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Der HRE CEO Georg Funke said, however, that the proceeds, real estate group will not need the money markets for the foreseeable future, exercise more. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Federal Reserve and the Federal Institute for financial services regulator (BaFin) assume that the marketability of plate real estate group was assured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is to be hoped for shareholders and creditors of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But given the momentum and uncertainties about the crisis there is probably not a certainty. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is even possible that the financing must be taken in full. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But the opposite is not auszuschleißen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> After the bank was on the late Sunday night reportedly before the insolvency, also provisionally rescue able to calm down. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The stock price is collapsing by 75 percent to 3,30 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Well the bond prices keep opposing it. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The primary debt strokes are barely budged, show the rate of senior bonds after spending significantly. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Primarily affect the bonds of former subsidiary Baden-Württemberg plate and understandably, through 2009 its duration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Scenarios seem real estate loans previously a speculative investment alternatives, so their value even when the clear upgrading of the banking crisis and the Institute itself, with the acquisition of DEPFA had picked up the crisis first into the house must be regarded by the stability of the international financial system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> As long as the central banks, governments and less risky to prop up the banking system are prepared, as long as it can be taken by a timely repayment of pensions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Or it is what now hardly anyone dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> However, in the light of the partial nationalisation of crushing reports currently only be hoped is from the security probably become. </seg>
<seg id="40"> This should not cause long-term creditors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to get rid of their commitment. </seg>

<seg id="13"> I am not the type who is happy to talk to people, even from a class of 40 pupils. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because I still had no school uniforms, I have attracted an old rock My host mother, blouse, blue knees assets and black leather shoes. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A rat or a Schabe is pouring in danger does that mean that she feels also fear? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The neuron scientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: too many animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Just as you might want to check whether or not you feel the same, and if they are similar to our behavior? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the online magazine Edge "contributions famous scientists are being published for several years. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Spiegel Online true presented evidence in a series of selected answer to the question, "What do you think of that?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I believe that animals feelings and others have consciousness conditions, without that I or anyone could prove otherwise so far where we can prove even that other people have consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this case, however, we must at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, as soon as we turn to other species and the questions of the perception or the general awareness of commitments that we entered unwegsame site because of the hardware did not agree. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat is at risk, they are doing the same thing as many other animals: she is dead, retreats or attacks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People behave similarly, some scientists, led to a comparable subjective experience. </seg>
<seg id="12"> I do not believe, however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of the brain structure makes it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> On the one hand, the almost always with the human consciousness associated circuits a close down the sides of prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the short term memory and to the implementation and management functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This vast region is in human patients developed much higher than that of the other primates and seems to be lacking on other creatures. </seg>
<seg id="16"> To plan and to decide, at least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the know who we are and the ability, there is reason to believe that a person who differs even by the other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another dramatic character in the linguistic nature of the human being, because such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it has often been awareness depends. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case it could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But even if consciousness varied not by language, this would influence there, animal awareness so that it may be released as well, and probably a majority of the differences between our awareness of conditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This is why it is so difficult to determine exactly how consciousness might look for other animals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If it is, as something internally and subjective, neither judge nor, due to the special hardware, from our own experience analysis, presented his research into major problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my comments relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which will be scientifically easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> We could study the consciousness process of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happens with studies on the short term memory of primates, especially in the case of the visualisierung. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But with this approach, the Christofer cooking and Francis Crick was, shuffling rather neural cases of consciousness as to the causal mechanism: they may or may not be identical. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly, this approach emphasises the importance of the prefrontal cortex to the genesis of visualisierung. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="26"> What emerges for the feelings? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I attribute it to ensure that an emotional schemes like that of fear is activated in one of his own conscious brain activity. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we call a "fear", is the mental condition in which we find ourselves, when the activity of the brain localised defense system (or to its consequences, such as physical reaction) working memory. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Seen in such sentiments are almost tied closely to the regions of the cortex, the primates and in particular to the people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Combined with the linguistic nature are partly to blame for the subtle gradation of feeling because we can draw distinctions with the help of the words and the grammar conditions and categorize to keep them apart from ourselves and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In comparison, for example, Antonio Damasio sentiments that emerge from more activity in the physical sense region of the cortex of the brain stem and thinks similar Jaak pankseep which concentrates more on the brain stem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Since have changed the network over the course of human evolution is not very much, it could be involved in generic cross-border impressions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Purely theoretical and I cannot contradict the, I feel that it is unbeweisbar. </seg>
<seg id="34"> What pankseep argued in rats and people like fear appears to feel it is likely that, in both cases: how to check whether rats and people feel the same, if you behave similarly? </seg>
<seg id="35"> A Schabe is pouring in danger if fear feels they too? </seg>
<seg id="36"> In my view, merely behaviour similarities can prove not yet see opportunities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Although the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, however, not even a brain Schaben. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the brain stem is responsible for feelings? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if we could show this to the people: how they wanted to prove it in rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I am not sure how I should demonstrate this. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because their sentiments presumably fundamental from our (since the human consciousness based on specific circuits and language), erfor Arabian I distinguish the emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Any progress they passed here at the neural level, provided that it attaches in rats and humans do the same. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As I erfor of languages and not in rats, not feelings, but I do not know whether they exist. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You may think this is short-sighted, but I get preferred to run as a standing against a wall. </seg>

Izumi, senior scientific staff in kalifonische studies and senior director in the specialist field of education sciences to the vessel named Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "is not as good as we thought: why the middle class needs a school choice". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Hispanic voters is to address a complicated task. </seg>
<seg id="5"> 's Barrack Obama's proposals on the subject of education is a typical example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obama campaign referred to the "probability for African-American and Hispanic students to school success, is lower than it is among white pupils' - what. </seg>
<seg id="7"> To close the achievement gap, Obama's education plan recommends special among other bilingual transition in the training for those who learn English first. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether its use for the bilingual education which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, to reduce the gap in the school performance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Let us take the example of 'Sixth Street "preparatory conference", "an elementary school in East Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The majority of pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently in the country, an English learning. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nevertheless, an astonishing 100 percent in 2008 pupils was the fourth classes the state tests in math on a good footing. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprising 93 per cent of children have been assessed for the fourth school year in the English test as well. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This astonishing success was achieved through other methods, than those who are favored by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school Sixth Street focused on review and exercise, by constant monitoring of knowledge and an attitude that tolerated no exception. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Moreover, the schools used the approach according to which the training runs in an English-language surroundings. This is precisely the point that Obama should take, the school head, Linda Mikel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach places value on the nearly exclusive use of English in the specialist teaching. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mrs Mikel, which rejects the idea bilingual education said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil who was first on the verge of Mexico. Twelve months later, we were entering the classroom and they are able to inhabit not more. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It works," she observes, "it works for us". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Obama would take a school as the "sixth" preparatory conference "street" as a model for other schools with a large percentage of Latin American and other English learners pupils? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The performance of the schools would make the answers to these questions, but the education policy positions within his own party (the National bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea bilingual education), and his own consistent support of bilingual education to make predictions about Obama answer uncertain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While it agrees with the score that immigrants should learn English, he trivialized the issue recently when he said that people should stop worry about on "English only" goal of legislation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, he said, "they would ensure that her child can" in Spanish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama wants to close the achievement gap actually, he must take a careful formation model that works to despise and to trivialise rather than you. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The pride and the consequent fatigue in the life of the black population, in a town of quite particular type </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hidden among the excesses of leisure park within a radius of Orlando, a few miles from the glitzernden, noisy and gigantic drive away is a quiet town where the pride and the complications of African-American culture come to the fore. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eaton Louisville, the first true entirely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neal hurstons, description is not as simple as Hurston in 1935: "The town with five lakes, three krocketplätzen, 300 Brown hide, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no jail." </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays it is a pilgrimage site. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee at the annual Zora! festival in Eaton Louisville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And yet it was and the city that describes you - and you have made to a tourist outing goal by acquired it in the Florida trip leader who has been produced during the Depression, the Federal Writers' Project - remains in many ways a site of special varieties. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eaton Louisville is so independent, dignified and private as in the 1930's when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida refused, often to share your true thoughts with the white man who knows "so few of us that he does not know what escapes him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even now, a year from now, a black presidential kanditat, Senator Barack Obama, in a frank conversation about race relations in the call, there are many people here still suffering to be seen by outsiders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "We are very anxious as telling our story," Jones hortens, 59, from birth, a resident of the town and the local member of the city's oldest churches. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must be true. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eaton Louisville was defined a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There is one historical example of the black movement as a community of nearly 2.400 residents where the poverty rate is twice the national average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand it is a stronghold of literature and on the other hand, is an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes vaunted - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not surprising that people here both pride than were also on the alert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And so the doubts at Eaton Louisville 's image began with Zora Hurston, as all here. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It presents the world their hometown in books, who died of heart and written in dialect of goods, such as "Mule and Men" (1953) and "portrayed Your Eyes were Watching God" (1973). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide to the city, which is quite near the route 77 modified, a road leading through the often forgotten centre Florida to the scene of black history and human tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Smart as Oskar both in real life as in the literature, Hurston reader led to the shop by Eaton Louisville first mayor, Joe Clark, and turned to then privater affairs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Aside from the roads to the left," she wrote, "is the Brown white angestrichen modern schools, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, the cares and Howard Miller, although he can barely read and write." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> She also mentioned the new man of widows dash and wrote that Lee fits Glenn "drinks of any kind and sold whatever to hours rooms." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In only a few hundred words Hurston expressed so Eaton Louisville with even governments, but also of illiteracy, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was certainly not a tour guide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In fact, this was not a portrait that has been appreciated by all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "Zora describing things as they were," the 90 Pittella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls immortalized the Hurston by quoted the men, sang the songs on its beauty, which were full of sexual innuendo. </seg>
<seg id="25"> She added: "Some people didn't." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> They remember here still hurtson than a lively exzentrik Londoner who returned on a regular basis, after their families was withdrawn after Jackson Louisville, Florida. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Franklin, Augustus, 77, remembers that Hurston came when the city gebr oyster, it usually without warning she did, in a noisy, Chevrolet rauchend and with trousers, dressed in a city which even today is somewhat on its venerable clothing style holds. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to Mr Franklin most residents were fascinated, whereas many despise them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "People were always glad to see Zora", Mr Franklin said. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But "she was never too long," he added as he schaukelt in his chair, christening on a backfire handily patio that looks at the sabelia sea where Hurston, in all likelihood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and their books vergriffen. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Along with the majority of the world's Eaton Louisville seemed to have forgotten them. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Though she was once a famous author, a zeitgenössin langstin Hughes and the only black women at Barnard College in the 1920ern, they were in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eaton Louisville, there was no major commemoration, no public reading in high style. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "I don't think that you have understood your contribution in the world or their heritage in the slightest," published in 2003 as Valerie Boyden, author of "wrapped in rainbow," a biography of Hurston. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The turning point came in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street in the borough. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlando suburb had already called the motorway 4 through the western edge of town. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The proposal was presented as Eaton Louisville still recovered from a difficult phase in its history. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Compulsory integration, among other things, the relatively idyllic isolation of the communities were brought to an end. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing hatred expressed in the community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "In this time was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the sidelines sitters people," Mr. Franklin said. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "There was even a woman who was killed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> They threw a water melon of a car. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In 1955 Hurston questioned having it in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the demands of the Supreme Court, integration, baptising his decision in Brown against the schulrat as "insulting instead of my race respektierend." </seg>
<seg id="46"> Residents say nowadays that weakens although the lifting of racial segregation was in some respects positive, the groups cohesion in Eaton Louisville and self-assurance its young people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> "black children were grown accustomed to be embraced - I recall - it embraced his teachers in the morning and they embraced his teacher at night", N. Y. nathiri, daughter of Pittella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit groups to protect the Eaton Louisville communities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> This could be so long maintained, she added, by teachers and pupils came not from the same place. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "They embraced his white teachers, not because he is a white teacher - I was there is a cultural gap existing," said Mrs nathiri said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> However, the rights of citizens who have helped to ensure that Neal hurstons has room for further Zora created - black writers, actors and artists who flouts prejudices, as it did, with positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How anyone can disagree with the pleasure of my company. </seg>
<seg id="51"> I do not understand it. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In 1975, the novelist Alice Walker, based on the way to hurstons anonymous graves and began struggling to revive their fame. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Five years later, a much-vaunted Hurston biography of Robert E. was finding Hemenway in the bookshelf, and makes you once again to a part of American literary canon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The highway project came exactly at a time, in the Eaton Louisville famous daughter was again in the clear light of day. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And this time hurstons old neighbors saw it as retterin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The communities began in 1988 with the planning a Hurston festival to show what could destroy the district with the construction of the motorway. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January, many returning for the ceremony. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> A few years later the county broke away from his road building projects. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "The plans a fünfspurigen highway crowded the city to speed up the whole thing with top speed, raises genuine citizens proud," said Mrs nathiri said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Mrs Boyden put it more simply: "Zora rescued Eaton Louisville." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the highway project has helped to change the image of the city itself. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There were more and more to travel, as an activist Munson, a lawyer who is, since 1993, here in the church, and residents began to appreciate the past. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eaton Louisville has been included in the 1998 Nationwide historic register. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new einstöckige Library (named, of course, after Hurston) opened in 2006 across the neugepflasterten and doctored Kennedy Boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Today, Eaton Louisville still an anomaly in Florida, just 6 miles from the town centre Orlando they can anfühlen is sometimes as, founded as small as then as they are of only 27 black families in the 1880ern a short alleyway in the summer rain. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (It is nowadays to 90% black.) </seg>
<seg id="67"> Outsiders in search of history Eaton Louisville and its significance are still often treated with caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most of the interview an authorisation in advance is necessary, and certain things - such as the wall painting by Eaton Louisville eldest church which was painted by a white and black men in the field work - not to be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eaton Louisville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a penchant for Dunkelrot, still fear that their secretive community is misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And yet, at the same time, to the greater the Hurston festival was also an increased degree was born at home proud. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Young people in particular tend to see Eaton Louisville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better, just as proud, creative, hard-working, silly and blended as any other racial groups and peoples in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It is the sincere love for this town, which you could hear the voice of Mr Franklin nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, the plans after the college after Eaton Louisville in the town hall or working with the police, who could use a little help according to him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Keno, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park have learned to describe Eaton Louisville correctly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> "Most people who drive only here will think: 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other" Alondra Keno said recently on Sunday after the church. </seg>
<seg id="75"> "But if you stop and consider for a moment in its history, it is a very beautiful city." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Inspired by 'episodios Nacional' of Benito Pérez galdós, José Luis carci represents in 'Sangre de Mayo', the revised version of the famous of the Spanish uprising against French. It is an admirable films in the filmographie, with approximately 15 million investment for the town. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In this way the cineast has tried to portray "a lot of personal and social analyses', as he had always admired in the works of the famous novelist, today carci said at the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula echevarría at the beginning of a long list of characters. </seg>
<seg id="4"> 'Sangre de Mayo' with a film of more than two and a half hours will be presented this Friday in cinema and shown later on the Radio Tele Madrid as a four hour mini series. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> José Luis Garci, a fan of the literature of galdós assured that his' childhood dream 'was thanks to this pivotal work in fulfilling. He owes Esperanza Aguirre, who appointed him three years ago by the Autonomous Community of Madrid, to swing a commemorative film on the second century ceremony on 2 November in Madrid, and above all because the story is based on the basis of' episodios Nacional ', of the mandate adopted. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The total contribution of EUR 15 million, which was released by the Autonomous Community of Madrid hub for work offers Garci, as he does, the 'unique opportunities' posing with the help of decoration and appropriate clothing that image of the 'confused Spain which was the wrong leader for the fight will pick, because the people expressed by the fight for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII of the Fallen. " </seg>
<seg id="7"> But the cineast regrets that they could not count on the funding as in 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in 'Sangre de Mayo'), which is why some scenes could not be rolling out the script with Horacio valcárcel, with the Garci working nearly his entire career. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in "Volver a empezar 'has played through his exceptional work: it is based on stage with the actor, with whom we must test first, before you start to swing and for those who had made no casting, he seemed" humiliating "and respect verschaffend," part of the profession of film director is to provide assistance in theatre and cinema, to see what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works. " </seg>
<seg id="9"> So many performers, he encountered in 'Sangre de Mayo' must repeat before his camera Cuervo, as in the case of Miguel rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> , Garci Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he has won a) believes and gave assurances that none of the three candidates, who represented this year in Spain before the Academy of Hollywood, a younger generation of Spanish filmographie. Neither 'Sangre de Mayo', or 'Siete Mesa de billar known' and, finally, not the chosen films Los Gira aerosols ciegos'. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For these films Garci expected no award. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "At the beginning bet that du arbeitest for the descendants, later du merkst that is only for prosper, and now you are satisfied, if no one has yet produced a film, Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity," he said. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The nonsense starts with the ticket repeat that allows you to go first. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It also seems to me to be no bad thing, but if they let you do, then you should give you all (including chip to avoid the congestion on the roads). </seg>
<seg id="10"> But not so. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here they can get you just the ticket (the first nonsense that is to be the only reason then) and (after an endless queues) as is the surprise! the T-shirts, there were only in the size of '(a second nonsense because I need the size XL) </seg>
<seg id="12"> Where are we living in fact? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Or is it the case that a decision has been taken after the crisis only small to buy much cheaper shirts from less fuel? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Well, things like this is peanuts compared to the days on the road. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Apart from the fact that you can go very early to get the chip, there is already a queues of at least 15 minutes and, furthermore, it must be subject to the backpack. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which, in the case of a road, where 11 000 people are expected, is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Finally, as was to be expected, the road began and we had to lie back our bags, fear, even if it was successful, but they would recover more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Furthermore, it seemed, in this 40 minutes waiting for rain, so too the temptation was to organise a popular uprising and to Häuschen. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I believe that tomorrow, of course, some 500 people have lung inflammation and some seem like myself are because this chip, which I received, not even in time for the classification, I am quite sure that the outcome was branded wrong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Of course, if you would ask me for a perfect Road, these roads would never come. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> If it is a disease for the first time, in the best case would be alarmed, but in reality it has no meaning. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This is a positive sleep disorder, the talk is named in sleep. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is fairly common, especially among children and young people. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Sure, more than a told you that you have spoken at night. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, such as during the high fever), or regular (daily, once a week to once a month), the next day the child can remember. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> There is not one single reason which caused this phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Often connections with other phenomena are sought in their sleep, such as nightmares, panic at night, enuresis noctura (beds Nässe night), talking in their sleep, but there is no reason to do so. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As we have said before, it can be a very high fiber, stressful situations or on demand. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In any event, it is a little researched phenomenon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The frequency with which this occurs is very variable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It may be that one speaks calmly over each word, whispering or it can be quite a contrary (shrine, wine, long discussion). </seg>
<seg id="15"> In those cases, if the expression is very intensive, are encouraged to observe the baby and to consult with a specialist to check whether there has been a problem, which causes anxiety and in this way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> We have said that it is a positive disruption, so it is not treated, it is linked to a different sleep disorder, they can be dealt with is (for example, with the sleep apnoe or with the stress). </seg>
<seg id="17"> What you can do is carry out a series of simple precautionary measures: </seg>
<seg id="18"> Try to get the child before sleep. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In other words, choose a steady game for the child and avoid stressful television programmes which are terrible and a little too wild. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In the restless children, those clubs are recommended, relaxation techniques can be used to help you to get a certain degree of inner calm. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This helps to sleep the baby quiet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> When that happens for once talking in their sleep, tried to keep calm. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Remember that it is for the innocent child and the next day it will be able to remember what happened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Useful advice </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Arousing is not on. </seg>
<seg id="26"> It is useless because the child is unconscious, so you will get it from its slumbers. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Although the baby to sleep there, so it takes. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Remember when frightened after a few phenomenon shows, it is recommended that you be advised on or find out what reason to fear the baby. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If you listen to what it says (not so usual), the child is not under pressure to carry an interrogation and getting more information. </seg>
<seg id="30"> So if we can achieve this not because the baby is sleeping when, is unconscious and cannot think. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In addition, you can hear her what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it says it, so you have to be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that it draws from this. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Perhaps, says the child that you hear that night and know his secrets. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Not even as a joke. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This caused a great deal of fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Therefore, do not worry, it does not matter if it is a moment that lasted only a few minutes. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Conversation - from the blood that was safe again </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema Quebec yesterday, celebrates the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine décary had become every reason to rejoice, because Hema Quebec is one of the safest, most efficient blood bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And above all, she has recovered the confidence of the public, which has been rocked by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980's and 1990's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As you know, the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross managed national blood reserve during the 1980s were infected with HIV or the hepatitis C virus. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the face of this tragedy and the public discontent, the Canadian government launched in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever led investigation, which was intended to shed light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to draw up a directive in order to prevent new disasters of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judges Krever hesitates to give his report, several provinces then asked a committee on their feet, whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Quebec's committee gélineau performed this task. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the report by gélineau and Krever Hema Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood Society to provide the other provinces, and the two territories was founded in Canada two blood banks:. </seg>
<seg id="9"> "In 1998, Hema Quebec started its work, had almost 38% of people confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr décary remembers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was daunting. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Through the huge efforts to ensure the safety of the blood to improve and by the work in this area during the next year, we have won back the trust of the public, "she says, before they had laid a proud that, at the beginning of 2008 nearly 94% of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr décary but it retains the awareness that 'confidence is something extremely fragile'. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema Quebec is acting in accordance with the principle of caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This time we witnessed with the arrival of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, these women, who since its inception in 1998 the leadership said. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "And we have not had the remotest idea whether the disease could be transmitted through the blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So we convened at a main directive and the report by Krever gélineau that you use exclusion measures, if we do not and if the disease progresses slowly, as it is obvious in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is reflected through a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So we adopted in April 1999, no blood from people who had not been since 1980, more than a month in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, a few years ago has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So this event has shown us that the principle of caution, which we would apply, the sense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999, arrived on the market in a much more accurate techniques to detect HIV: the nukleinsäure tests (NST) that will enable us to demonstrate it, directly in the blood of the donor and the presence of the virus itself, and not the antibodies against the virus, as there was in the test has hitherto been the case. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST allows us to shorten the incubation period, which will take place between the time when the infected person and, if the first viruses can be demonstrated by our technology in the blood, the specialist said. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced to a span of less than a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So the risk that certain donors could be infected, without being aware of it, and you could not see was much lower. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This improvement will enable us to reduce the risk to transfer AIDS through a blood transfusion, to a considerable extent. </seg>
<seg id="25"> These days, one of 12 million people is running the risk of getting HIV infected blood. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "In other words, this means that we should allocate 12 million blood before someone infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Since Hema Quebec distributed each year, between 400,000 and 500,000 blood, it would take more than 24 years before an event occurs, when the transfer of a blood packed HIV. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that it is possible to feel nowadays it well if you get a blood transfusion or prescribed to restore the health ', the head of the Directorate of Hema Quebec said. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Our challenge for the next ten years, the safety of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> You never know, into the system which pathogens can reach. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year, has appeared on the island of Réunion, the chikungunya virus, which is transmitted in the same way as the westnil virus, by insects on the blood. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must monitor uninterrupted, "Dr. décary continued before it must be stressed that Hema Quebec alongside a secure supply also ensure adequate supplies available. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "The fact that demand, because the population is getting older. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Because the treatment for the cancer is aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood platelets. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The ageing of the population works are on the blood donor network, with an average of only 3% of the blood donation suitable natives of Quebec. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> Every healthy person can, who is 18 years or older and the eligibility criteria donations, all 56 days, six times a year, blood. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On average, 14% of the people who put their blood available are rejected because they are ill for example of AIDS or malaria, and anyone who has travelled in a country where malaria is excluded for a year in donations. </seg>
<seg id="38"> "With this 3% to keep an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Lack of supplies are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But we must renew the members of the donor network, if they can be older, and donating blood. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The donation is difficult to convince people from blood, but above all to keep you and to encourage them to be regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Life is now so hectic that you rarely had time to spend an hour in donations', Francine décary regrets. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of EUR 297 million dollar Hema Quebec provided not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone grafting, heart valves and skin, augäpfel used almost exclusively for serious violations of fire. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These tissues to be investigated, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema Quebec, which manages the only public cord blood banks Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord, which had been seen earlier than biomedical waste, is rich in stem cells in the blood, which can be used to treat diseases such as leukaemia. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "A few weeks ago, we celebrated the stockpiling of thousands of most cord blood samples, and we plan to wane, every year, more than a thousand. </seg>
<seg id="47"> "We should start well at the beginning of next year in order to make it available for transplants," Dr. décary also declared, which describes this programme of umbilical cord blood tests as very popular. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "Many of the mothers are convinced that they have no access to it 'because the Hema Quebec the resources to these complex and very costly programmes lack offer in all hospitals Quebec. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Free expression - the Orwellian talk of Barrick Gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In its edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, deputy director general of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms and maintains an Orwellian logic that the biggest gold mining company in the world to have a defamation lawsuit over six million against three authors and a small loose publishing house, with the aim to open a 'public with transparent debate ". </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then you do not base their judgments on the truth, especially in the case of libel case, but above the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expected, this fundamental difference was concealed by Mr Garver completely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As for Barrick Gold, the best way is to conduct a public debate to drive everyone into the ruins on anyone who dares to one of their opposing views. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Whatever the outcome, the authors and the editor of the paper noir Canada will have to spend substantial sums to prepare their defence and are struggling with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who comes from the pockets of almost inexhaustible gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactics in this unequal struggle is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders to enforce an amicable settlement, which the opposition party is muzzled and also discourage anyone who dares to look again at the issue. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to display their vision of things from public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In contrast to what happens in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, and there is to be debate in Canada fought normally through the exchange of ideas, and not by truncheons whipping. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It would have been enough if the gold mine would have opened up their books and files and opens a genuine debate, through the newspapers, media and publishing and financing independent assessment team that could shed light on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick Gold seems to have no faith in the public opinion and side has dismissed the petitions and letters in support of the writers of noir Canada with one hand movements. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Could perhaps explain to Mr Garver, how can he please make a "public" debate and disregarding, but the level of public? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently this word in the world of Vice-President only generously remunerated lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a brilliant cramped, measuring only 10.7 m vision of the concept. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy, the detractors have the right to speak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What Barrick do not understand - or understand not gold - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of noir Canada, this is above all because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Public opinion is ready to listen Barrick and judging, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a context, whom many perceive as their knees complaint (during the "public debate" Barrick Gold has sent a request to the authors of noir Canada, in which she requires you to use this term not more...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surreal speech from Mr Garver, the complaints of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth, which is fundamental to all democratic societies. </seg>
<seg id="19"> They have denied the right to quote credible sources and discuss the facts and the interpretation which form the basis of intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it is in a country like Canada impossible, to investigate and to discuss issues that favors the rich companies of this world, who can do it? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick Gold really follow a public and transparent debate wanted, she could lead it by the scientific standards that were used by the authors of noir Canada. </seg>
<seg id="22"> She has a right to reply. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The academic environment to which we belong do for a long time to have debate and disagreement grip and resolve conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaints of Barrick Gold, clearly shows that it has, in contrast to what it claims, no desire to have transparent debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It's a loss for the university world is, as it was for the public debate, and it is time for the governments to take measures to restrict this kind of unwarranted action. </seg>

<seg id="2"> At an auction buyers tend to spend more and to exaggerate the deepest offered. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Neurologen and economic researchers from the universities of New York managed to discover the neurological economic foundations that well-known and apparently irrational behavior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to one in "Science" magazine published studies which people want to turn themselves in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not beaten and are willing to pay even inflated prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Researchers have tried to explore the neurological system this "game" with experimental auction. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A group of volunteers should play the lottery, while the other was attending a playful action - in both cases were investigated the active brain regions of enrolled through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In two games the participants to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain beef was measured at losers of the auction, which surpass the opponents also plays a major role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Among the many other functions these brain regions is to "reward" of the nervous system. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The researchers said that the price increase could be by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> To shore up their argument, The Economist went to the researchers added investigations for the follow-up of the money. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case, three groups against a partner to bid under different conditions. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The control group was notified of the true value of products, then you have made their operations. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another group was promised 15 dollar reward if they emerge as winners from the game. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were lost in the event of a lost game. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The difference between the two groups was then only to find that the emphasis in the one was on the win, while in the other loses. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As evidence of the neurologen expressed hypothesis, but members of the "against the" end game groups were prepared to higher stakes, as those in the control or the "winners" group. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="17"> "These results may be interpreted by any previous economic theory. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Hepatitis is the generic term for different types of viruses, infectious liver disease. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellow addiction are often, however, differ from the virus and the disease from one another. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Depending on the virus for hepatitis viruses on two different species: spread with hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water) from hepatitis B, C and D can transmit the virus through blood and other bodily liquids (such as sperm, distinguish sekret or speichel). </seg>

<seg id="10"> Worldwide approximately 1 million people from the hepatitis B triggered dies, far more serious illnesses such as liver cancer and cirrhosis. </seg>

<seg id="12"> Also, Hepatitis C can have serious consequences: untreated can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most of those infected do not know about your illness, since the virus destroys the liver cells insidious - in many cases, the first symptoms show after 20-30 years. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Believers have less pain? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As the latest research show that the religious believe honesty as a kind of 'analgesics', which should already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it has investigated how influenced the belief in God the pain of the people, the British journal Telegraph reported. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the wake of rather bizarre investigations ever 12 believers and atheists received electrical shocks while they studied a painting of the Mother of God. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the results show, the believers to eliminate most of the pain. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Using a brain scan technology have shown that even the Catholics could activate the part of your brain that is for the pain regulatory competence. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The study was the first in a research project in which philosophers and theologians participate as well as scientists from different sections of the university. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In seeking a glittering machine on the left hand were the subjects, which stun resigned. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a picture of the Mother of God of Sassoferrato, painted in the 17th century, and, on the other hand, Leonardo da Vinci "lady with the Hermelin." </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers are hoping that the sight of the Virgin Mary among believers would provoke a kind of religious trance, while she chooses da Vinci picture because differences is almost the same as the other paintings and as was felt reassuring. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People spent more than half an hour in an MRI scanner, and a total of 20 stun received in this period in four stages, while they should see either the religious, or the other paintings. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Catholics reported that they had felt at the sight of the Mother of God "in security", as if they were 'after', and they would have felt "calm and peace '. </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the view of religious paintings you talked about 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo stations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias who attended the attempt thought we could cause similar effects with other, strong retrospective images in the atheists, it would be just the right photo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "We must find a form which resulted in very positive sentiment, such as a mother or a father", the psychologist. </seg>

<seg id="2"> To celebrate its tenth birth days Google can genuinely say: that is to be found in the pockets of the people, as well as on their heads in the Sky: You know, where the people have spent their holiday to the professionals they are, and what they moved. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And this is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, the chief executive officer of Google. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the direction of skeptics who are beset with Orwellian nightmare vision, he leaves the pitch: this would ignore the very essence of the Web 2.0. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In an interview with The Financial Times Schmidt said recently that the main objective of Google is to collect more and more personal data about users and as the original purpose of the company, which they wanted to "give all of the information in the world". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt says Google, after ten years, world changing work is still only at the beginning of the information gathering. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wants, Google would be able to questions such as "What am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "what does a real job to me?" the answer, however, software programs are not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Not all Internet users are aware that the search term as part of its Internet searching registered, and also the IP address, from where it was, and the visiting side. </seg>
<seg id="9"> For example, the two years ago introduced "personalized searches' can be allowed to store the visit during his own search and to resort to that later, the hit so later generated a lot more precise, and on the same logic as the so-called 'recommendations', to make the system recommends tailor-made products and services as a result of the previous preferences are based. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The users wondering what would happen in the event of data abuse - "If you look what I am '- some worried whether the Google data monopolies. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In most cases, however, it is more likely that the firm represents, potential power that scary, and less the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the force that has for many Internet users of rejection. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, it is a proven fact that the search term to be stored, not just passed on the opportunity also to third parties, and that law cases, there is no protection for the personal rights of Internet users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A perfect example is was recently the fight against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google the Brazilian government gave information that has been collected by the community site called Orkut "and even an identification of paedophilia. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For individual rights concerned users could breathe a sigh of relief yet in May when Google with civil rights organizations EFF drew successfully against the FBI in Court: according to Google in the future with no part of the Constitution cannot be forced to publish information the FBI secretly question. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (However, the federal government has successfully secured the release of 50,000 webadressen and 1,000 search term referring to the years ago adopted youth protection legislation, however, it was the list of individual users, or whose Web and search term list denied on two months backdated.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Google image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to enter their personal data because they fear by using the Google service on the loss of their private sphere, the company scourge of the conservative performing firms due indignation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Meanwhile, the American "geek culture" that is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and user unites, the next generation of entrepreneurs "cool" in you, unlike Microsoft's Windows, it is thanks to market leader, although both are battling for the same goal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> One possible reason for this is that Google requires its users unlike Microsoft no identification code, and its services free of charge, a constantly updated, open source code and programme package to be far more attractive to young people and cool appear when the official practices of the software giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand, the geek overview of the problematic relationship with the rights of the individual and the Internet's razor-sharp - a relationship that has shifted in recent years thanks to the concept of a "Web 2.0" in den Mittelpunkt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The "Web 2.0" is nothing other than about collaborating, i.e. by the addressee left deliberately traces and the available channels of communication, and even if its proportions are individually in different ways, the main problem remains the same, namely to show in public. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An average young person can manage simultaneously at several community portal his profile - from Facebook on Xanga, this can combine with other services, such as Twitter, or music services like Last.fm, and all this cannot engage in a follow-up system such as friend feed or blip.fm. In addition, they can blog, which represent the latest photo galleries automatically that are geostet on Flickr and Picasa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a number of other cases it proves: looking at the party photos last night's girlfriend soon, with whom her infidelity friend was enjoying having dinner, or of staff redundant because he makes in his blog too honest his anger over the management of companies air, one thing is certain: the word "privacy" was interpreted by now completely new. </seg>
<seg id="23"> If you have an online life, is what he gives up - as in some way could reword the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or circumventing the Google monopoly can gladly do that - as with scroogle, a Toole, the zugreift on the search engine Google, but deliberately leaves no trace. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Not many people are deliberately not from the Community side, so that they are untraceable, but also the online applications from Google, like text processing and on-screen tools and RSS feeds, deal with alternative version, which are tied to a vast server Park and generate has not been the best possible profiles of users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Public opinion is nevertheless diminished until Google shows its true colours. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With its current value of about $156 billion, the company is even before IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the advertising of AdWords and AdSense threaten the revenue of the advertising agency, and the increasingly rapid introduced services prepared not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical consideration, however, the worrying against Pole: for example, the group rejected a protest of the staff were completely, after the fees the company's nursery has doubled, but also the management believes the frequent meals of staff is too costly and that all sounds but quite mild against Google in 2006 went off the Chinese government even in the knees and an agreement was in which every dissident hits, extracted, or those who violate the good taste. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal regulations of the group is that no new services are being advertised in advance, but only if this is already available, but the events of the next few months and years could completely change back some powerful: while some believe Google book and magazine scans or archiving projects now assume that the company would have to come to terms as soon as the Supreme Court, others are worried because the system "health", the compilation of a complete health profiles allows using found, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And that Google is a genetic database, the fact is the next generation of SCi contents authors the stuff - some "scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian fashion a future in which a man thanks to Google personal data is terrifying nahbar. </seg>

<seg id="4"> At the CEATEC Japan in an astonishing project were presented, in which the Nissan engineers by Hummel was inspired in the creation of new accident irresistible follows system. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokyo University Nissan has built the car robots controlled biomimetische system from type br23c, a mini car, equipped with the characteristics of the bee, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The flight each bee formed their own oval "private sector", which is our own "shield" very similar kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, the exhibition said. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The buzz, the eye of the bee that can see in every direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees game play an important role in this. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The function of the compound, the researchers on replicating the idea of the laser guided distance knife. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It identifies obstacles before br23c in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 metres, its removal calculated and sends signals to the micro prozessor on board, who started immediately the collision vermeidenden process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the robot instantly change the course, similar to the movement of bees when he turned the tires at the proper perspective. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unlike previous system these maneuvers will take place purely instinctively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "If it were not so, the car robots could react fast enough to avoid the obstacles', Toshiyuki Andoh, director of" hullaballoo laboratory "and the car robot project said. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must instinctive and immediately react, since this technology corresponds to the innermost part and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer of accidents are currently still considered unavoidable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The entire process must reflect the behaviour of others if they avoid other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And this should be done in a split second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, the Dodge, unlike the bees, not going up, down, or even diagonal - there can be only two dimensions, and only in the direction of wendbarkeit of tyres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> While there are evading the bee here endless possibilities open to other bees, the researchers could use the robot car only the movement, or, indeed, the acceleration and deceleration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The br23c contains lithium polymer batteries which are light and energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional lithium batteries illuminated. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Andoh stated, it is the instinctive, intelligent responses, and less on the processing of data, and still less on the ability to retain this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> These devices must per second process only a few inputs and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It must retain this, or produce from previous exercises an intuitive, logical reaction, just a handful of KB memory so it constantly on the increase. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There is no gigabits and megabyte hard memories. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which will be rated by Nissan within the next ten years standard in production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation, since it draws the motorists' awareness about obstacles around and it leads as the target. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had revealed themselves some days, to save the chamber of deputies voted against the 700 billion dollar saving package the White House: most of the Americans, and he is more concerned to punish the Wall Street than the economy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirmed yesterday's edition of The New York Times, which reported that the crisis would divide in the Republican Party that divides in their old and moderate East Coast soul, which favours the national institutions and the business community and those neo-conservative that 'those in Washington "and the financial world hostile faces and particularly in the south and centre of the states to win voters. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the Party owes his rise V. A. The voice which I mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I have mentioned this example is, however, only a small proportion of the major changes, the Herald's current economic earthquake or even is already affected, not only in the United States, including in the West, and perhaps also be infuriated by this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In both states, as well as in Europe the crisis seems to speed up the long feared events which, in these new circumstances, finally adopt the form and come to light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the extraordinary renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of agriculture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Indeed, the crisis is a decline of banks and financial institutions, which have close links to foreign countries and at the same time managing a huge amount of assets in domestic households living in a single state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means an immediate political problem for the government: how to behave towards the families affected, which is also a huge voter mass. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis is therefore economic global politically, however, it is almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems in itself to be pushed aside and lost his speech rights: the obvious evidence of this is provided by the EU, what do we find due to their division into various national and international conflicts, a common path. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Therefore, all now expect the intrusion of the state of their own; rescue plans, new rules, and V. A. distribution of aid funds: increasingly serious the crisis has been to the United States in the economic situation are just to save their unaided. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And in addition to the resources you possess the legitimacy to use these: two not to be judgmental conditions - under certain circumstances - to which they can take recourse if no international organisation or market in similar fashion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Those new emphasis on the state-owned national element is perfectly compatible with the increasing importance that will be launched very recently in the economy, with a relative cross-pillar sector: the territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Paradoxically, it is precisely now, to have occurred as we were so convinced, longest in a networked global empire, in an increasingly sophisticated technology, many of the intangible, that we must see at once, as our future will depend, more and more of the essential material things: water, harvesting and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These are of course all transported from one place to the rest of the world, are related, but nevertheless extremely with a narrowly circumscribed piece of earth - a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So anyone who has this kind of territory, is another, who lives in a cash crops, water or by oil free zones, at an advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I shall now turn to the second novelty, which, however, presupposes a brief digression. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Anyone who says territory, those governments, those politicians, some leadership says so. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand, the awareness of the need for perceived leadership, the need for someone who knows how things are. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other hand, a wave of indignation about the existing leadership, particularly those of the economy, which have proven to be inadequate and full shadow zone is now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Finally, there is a deep and far-reaching, and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, a picture of the futility of, a sense of distance, all on a whole class of managers of Western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It appears that the belief among large sections of the population to pave the way, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their ideal world, their way of life, their culture, in the broadest sense of the word, as it were, but whose content is the majority as always stranger and jaded. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand for leadership feeds so below a diverse but powerful movement of the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political establishment. This manifested itself in unforeseen 'revolt "of the voters and the sudden departure of collective mood swing state in recent times, starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Bavaria and Austria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of American members against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the law in Italy also plays a part). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One gets the impression that the old elite have, their party, your programme, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, and some would say its format, always more understanding problems and therefore less representative value with regard to what is nowadays in the lower strata of the West and reinforced by the financial crisis and forced to überdimensionalität. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In view of all this, it would simply be an exaggeration to speak of 'rebellion of mass ". </seg>
<seg id="28"> But the eyes wide open to consider is, however, it is not. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historic cinema close due beneficiaries of multiplex cinemas. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "a town without cinema is a blind city as a face without eyes." </seg>
<seg id="4"> This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect as now in the major urban centres, Italy, and in the provinces, that happens. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of exclusion of cinema, which began with the birth of the big multinationals Hall complex in the periphery, which means for the long term, the death of the einsaalkino Center. A process that seems not only inescapable and irrevocable, but also a cultural crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Affected mostly historical sites are full of memories, "is to lose as a friend, travelled on the roads has a bit of emotion," the director of the film 'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso ", which gave him 20 years ago, the Oscar and the big prize at Cannes; it is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, what it is to live in a good forever lost cinema world. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The figures which the organisation known as ANEC, the key industry association provides are clear: in the last five years the enormous quantities of 316 traditional cinemas have had to reach; this bill will pay the lion's share of the cinema in large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Rome and Naples, Bologna, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> One of the regions most affected by the Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinema, followed by Tuscany belong with 44 and Lombardy with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinema, because it is precisely these three regions in which registered the biggest number of modern cinema was: with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy led the list, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "Business has evolved into an irrational way," Paolo protti, the President of the organisation known as ANEC, "it is useful that new structures, but first and foremost, the preservation of already existing, for a house in the city, not all his tribal clients is ready to go, rather than the old a multiplex cinema in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And there is still the lack of resources allocated to the fund the industry association remains äußer eight: the state recorded debt totals approximately EUR 10 million. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral position that the government had not followed the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> To keep the sector, aged between 16 and 18 million euros would be a year of famine ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has adopted because of fears about the old cinema to protect this by means of an agreement between the Community and the organisation known as ANEC; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect the traditional movie and to support both in the historic centre, as well as in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Among the anticipated measures also fiscal before Partition are its for the cinema operators and advantages for the public in terms of transport: it will be allowed to travel to the traffic limited areas to the centre and to park in addition to cheaper parking charges. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "It is a very welcome initiative," Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and design also add new concept. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> To be sure, but we need to tailor a better audio and video equipment in order to combat the superpower of the multiplex ballroom something, because the audience for today is ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defense of the traditional movie has been for me, always an important matter: the closure of the "super" of baghiera cinema, where my childhood and youth was the tipping point, which brought me to inaugurate the "Cinema Paradiso" nuovo, even though I had played for 10 years ago with the idea. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years, I live in Rome; if I am acknowledging the Rialto or at the Quirinale on the via alliance, where I saw so many different emotions, I try not to hand to the dust covered posters. </seg>
