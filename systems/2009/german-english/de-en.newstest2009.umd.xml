<seg id="1"> duel on a knife edge: MP3-player against mobile phones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> we discussed it in your election </seg>
<seg id="3"> While nearly every mobile phone MP3 files can take place, is still not MP3 player phone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Despite everything, there is plenty of reasons why we should create an independent player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The election is the kind of use and the demands of the future owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Buy it is difficult for a brilliant expensive plates at home, in order to listen to the latest album From Maxim Turbulenc. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The first such musical new do not seem to LPs, and qualitative view there is no objective reason for it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, they have LPs with kind of rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, dream you probably at least of such. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So it is with the music on travel, with condensed music, simple-music in the MP3 format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> here too there is price and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Perhaps it is not acceptable for one, for a player to spend eight Kroner, but is also a Pink Floyd-fan unlikely headphones for 20 Kroner from the market cope. </seg>
<seg id="13"> two extremes, between those there is enough room for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The selection is diverse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The life of the battery is crucial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good music player can do a lot more than just music playing, but what phones can you not even hints. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern equipment is so universal as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to the primary functions, the phones and Sim Sen, music and videos, both, it has a better time to have a worse photo and can perhaps also navigate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> and if the Smartphons and communicators, almost a small computer in the pocket. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a small miracle, because no fridge can crickets and no television pictures. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of mobile phones also disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more you to use your mobile phone, the more often you will have to invite, however,. </seg>
<seg id="23"> and the place of music is one of the largest energy savings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only a few phones can music longer than ten-place 12 hours, mostly it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this regard, music player (easiest) clearly more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> You should count in the cheap mobile phones that they no longer than a few hours of music playing. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If they then and still buy they preferred to security or a loading equipment for office-that also applies to more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In MP3 players, they do not have this problem, the less good at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a time loading. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem is, if you want to play the music on mobile phone on. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment on a USB-conclusion, also is not every mobile phone without special software directly to a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> of course, the music directly to a storage medium on play, but only a few card reading equipment without reduction deal with the tiny storage cards, which are used in mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> players they need to exceptions (iPod) no special software. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need the device only on USB-port to feed with music from your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile phones and player, a music library, formed after the name of the performers, the title of the albums, the gender or the assessment by users, for example. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices are only the tree structure of the lists of addresses list, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (Iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> players are easier to use mobile phones can be more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The selection of a specific equipment, particularly after the lifespan of Akkus, the storage capacity, the quality and type of Klangs and, of course, ask the operator of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Music is all aid and hear them only briefly in the trams, then, for example, every day is any mobile phone, the MP3 files. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What can really almost every mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They must also not very monitor what music formats, a mobile phone or a player can process. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 create all, and most of the music they get, is precisely in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format is one of the most popular and most equipment can also music in Wma format. </seg>
<seg id="43"> less is usual AAC (a format that Apple and its use iPods). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> better phones will also be buying music online. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One need only on mobile Internet the sides of providers (or any other service), and you can buy a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service can already and for a striking argument for why we should create a music mobile. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately, the supply of providers bad and are usually confined to rapid Radiohits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Prices are also not the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> But the assumption is that this type of sales of music (on GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> The mobile phone, most in. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you want to listen to something, you after the mobile phone in the expected, while the player at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> However, it is important, whether they are headphones or at least a wireless free speech in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can at the integrated resort loudspeakers, almost every mobile phone, but only a few MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Probably the greatest benefit of music phones for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand Kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> for three-and four crowns, they have a very decent Walkmans. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest handicap for the most that are not normal headphones. </seg>
<seg id="58"> the best and most technologically sophisticated phones with a 3.5-mm-opening for normal headphones costs up to fifteen thousand Kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> the advantage of the player is the easy service. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest-and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use each. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of functions, the similarity in service with the normal Kassettenrekorder earlier or record players, for example, is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There is no conflict in the form of mobile Internet mistakenly employees and then horrendous bill for data transfers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> The equipment we should now resort </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) are generally on a slot for exchange storage media (type M2, Microsd, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if the card to buy, two crowns. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But respect. </seg>
<seg id="67"> The base models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB supported. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive can 8-GB memory cards read. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> if you already have a mobile phone and wanted to buy a cheap MP3 player, then pick up after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> depending on the capacity (Max. 2 GB) then they should not more than 1100 Kronor on the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> They are demanding listeners, they prefer specialized phones-Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). </seg>
<seg id="72"> These devices have independent Bedienknöpfe comfort for MP3, and the work is so in a individual MP3 players. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Most is Sony Ericsson, the mobile phones of the series Walkmans the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual providers is already in this year after the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile market is mature in the Czech Republic, Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they offered by its partners in western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> still missing something here-a virtual providers, the classic to lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps this will not long to wait. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Czech mobile phone operators to the most expensive in Europe at work, we have often on mobile.cz reported. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It also confirmed the telecommunications authority tú, the attention that the price of a text messages is higher here than in the rest of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the latest steps taken by the European Commission in regulation of roaming charges it is probably to a paradoxical situation for some customers of the Czech mobile telephone text messages from cheaper abroad than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How is it that the prices are so high in the Czech Republic compared with Europe? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, there is no competition, the really a challenge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, there are three mobile phone networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration of far more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile phone providers rant against like that there is very much competition on the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The often agrees, the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (TÚ) Pavel Dvoák, in, often said in the past that there is no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is likely that a classic providers with their own network has not so many opportunities (and he would probably also almost frequencies). </seg>
<seg id="15"> But there is still a possibility-a virtual providers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The entry of virtual service providers in the mobile phone market, a significant price reduction, on which the traditional mobile operators had to respond. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There were before the advent of such firms such as Tesco mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain, similar in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But it has shown that there is room for such providers and that this can be successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Moreover, it does not take long to find examples. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual mobile provider King in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> in just half a year, this providers, to win more than 100 thousand customers and so the five biggest supplier of the country. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Mobile King is the financial group Penta in Czech Republic including submarines: FON. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual suppliers is that we can concentrate on a much more specific target. </seg>
<seg id="24"> in order to be able to function effectively, need virtual service providers are much less customers as a classic providers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> You need a relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> in the world, the virtual providers normally as a low-cost companies-they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which often accompanied by a less extensive service. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> for example, Tesco mobile in Britain SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, as the example of mobile King in Poland, it can also be a very good move, a Klischeehafte target. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Those suppliers is specifically aimed at men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Real Kerle choose mobile King-the providers, you like and they can trust", as David is, the CEO of the mobile entertainment company, the company this virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It's hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could foothold in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Doubts also Vodafone's press officer Miroslav epický: "the Czech market for a market segment, based on the most virtual operators, relatively small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the services. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic chance, my mobile phone operators </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile providers conquered Czech Republic, this will not be mobile King. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We talk about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations were not very hopeful. </seg>
<seg id="37"> There will be more to a market entry of mobile King in other countries in our region ", says in a telephone conversation for mobile.cz Jana Studniková, press the financial group Penta spokeswoman. </seg>
<seg id="38"> indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile provider in the Czech Republic this idea not biased. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> their interest in a launch of a virtual mobile provider shows the GTS Novera group for some time, the one step further, a real competitor from Telefónica O2 in wholesale. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have a great interest in our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services. </seg>
<seg id="42"> and the sooner, the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> This opportunity we have negotiated with all Czech mobile operators. repeatedly </seg>
<seg id="44"> with some of them we have already negotiating progress ", the group's press spokesman Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps now better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> No official information shows that the first virtual providers may be expected by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> But this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "At the moment we do not assume that exists in the Czech Republic for a full virtual service providers. </seg>
<seg id="49"> the Czech market, to other markets specifics. </seg>
<seg id="50"> so far has no entity with a complex and serious project in this area ", says in his statement for mobile.cz Vlastimil Sre from the press department Telefónica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> on the nature of the Czech market, other providers. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press from T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the declaration of O2 added: "So far, we have not yet viable and mutually advantageous project found that we could build." </seg>
<seg id="53"> It adds: "the network of T-Mobile until the end of the year is hardly a virtual service providers. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At this moment we should already have a concrete offer before, to think so in the short term. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone directed his attention more to meet the requirements of its 3G licence. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav epický says: "We are open for negotiations with potential virtual providers, in particular in the area of division of costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> This is what we see as the best from the point of view of the customers. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in search of a partner to create a shared network for a rapid mobile Internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The authorities-with the suppliers hand-in-hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Mobile phone operators is easy to understand another providers would be more competition, this would lower prices and also lead to a decline in profits. </seg>
<seg id="61"> So why should we facilitate such a competitors entering the market? </seg>
<seg id="62"> The providers can pull together, when it comes to something, shows the long and talking about the emergence of submarines: FON. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of the tú was at the time when U: Fon on the market, from T-Mobile society. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The show also publicly accessible information from the tú websites. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Now lends itself, submarines: Fon as argument why we should not allow a virtual service providers. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrová said: "the competition environment of the mobile phone market was also recently by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player in the market, and particularly its services would high demands. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Given this approach of cell phone providers surprised but the absolute lack of Czech regulators. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is not only about the attitude of the tú in Czech, unfortunately, unlike Britain and other developed countries-not the competence to intervene in the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This is only the Office for the Protection of economic competition (Úohs). </seg>
<seg id="71"> But this referred to this whole issue its typical attitude. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "The market of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after a contract between a mobile phone providers and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> To date, there has been no such contracts, because the potential interested bid was probably not sufficient for the traditional operators interesting ", in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the foreign relations department of the Úohs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Representatives of the supplier would not surprise. </seg>
<seg id="75"> an authority, representing the interests of consumers, among other things, to ensure that no one abused its market position, this is more than worrying. </seg>
<seg id="76"> especially if Kristián Chalupa added: "abroad, where virtual providers are normal, is that its market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services." </seg>
<seg id="77"> But the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price reduction to the interests of the Úohs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> In this case is truly shocking almost touching the line of the three mobile phone operators, the result from their reactions. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the pumps is only coincidence and the result of tough competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "The authority has discovered no evidence in this matter to an action against the competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the supplier has a dominant market position, so he has not increased responsibility for his actions on the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> the necessary tools for the opening up of the mobile phone market for virtual absence probably also the regulatory authority for telecommunications providers ", in its statement. Chalupa </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of a dominant position on the market is one of the many points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> There are, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the tú, after the telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> In such a market, then, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators in a dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> But some legal experts offer a different perspective-for entry of a virtual supplier is always require approval by the network operator. </seg>
<seg id="88"> and the mobile phone operators, - logically-for its network the monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> which means that he in a certain segment is necessarily a dominant position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if not being with this argument, it should be a warning for the Úohs striking resemblance to that three mobile phone operators. </seg>
<seg id="91"> The show complaints a number of interested parties (including the GTS Novera mentioned society) that negotiations with all providers in very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The shifting of responsibility in the tú is a common trick the telecommunications services, with the Úohs distanced itself from the whole affair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was observed in a number of similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately, it is not possible to the recently adopted changed the telecommunications law enlarging the powers of the tú in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised an improvement of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives of the Úohs must know only too well, but they have other interests. probably </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It is, if nobody watching </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Unseen once the functioning of any pseudo-virtual service providers, which in the Czech mobile networks several. </seg>
<seg id="98"> There are companies that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but only part public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> It is usually the firms operating in multi-level marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> mobile telephone services for Amway Bohemia Telecom, Star life and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price lists these firms are normally only selected. </seg>
<seg id="102"> the joke of the matter is that the company against the operators as a classical firms customer, a large number of SIM cards. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As an important customer, he then special price offers (and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone providers a similar sale ban. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "Should there be cases that you describe, then it is a violation of the contractual conditions, where we are then, which brought an end to cooperation with the relevant society", said Martina Kemrová to our question on this issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> It is quite unlikely, however, that so something on the leaders of the mobile phone operators not spread. </seg>
<seg id="107"> particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned, to thousands of customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But no operator opposes such an approach. </seg>
<seg id="109"> The activity of these firms go to you is not negligible gains, at the same time, they will-unlike the real virtual providers-not be affected by the official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> potential problems, Miroslav epický ATTENTION: "the law enabling these types of speculation, despite the services of these firms used only a very small percentage of customers. </seg>
<seg id="111"> They must also accept that the SIM card in your phone is not in your name, you cannot fully on as normal customers mobile providers. " </seg>
<seg id="112"> But this should tú alone at least strange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> Besides another question for the Úohs. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The mobile phone operators such an approach the eyes, why block against a virtual providers? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It added that the Úohs has fairly strong powers to uncover such activities, and if it does not, it must not with the declaration of providers, they know nothing and their business conditions would ban this satisfied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> when the Czech Republic is no longer most expensive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As has been said repeatedly in the text, the market entry virtual providers a sharp price drop in the various services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Virtually all countries, where virtual operators, the traditional operators tried, which virtually to prevent more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The arguments were virtually identical they use-a small, or too much Gesättigter market, problems with the quality of services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> in advanced countries but attacks in these moments the regulators, not the interests of the mobile phone operators, but tried to maintain their customers. </seg>
<seg id="121"> whether through formal or informal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operators, and this followed further. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, throwing the Czech regulators the whole case as a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> based on our experience we can not get rid of that confusion in the competence in these cases more than good. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> But we do not throw the towel in grain. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background information and soon a virtual operators, the Czech mobile phone market may soon be moving again. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, the Úohs will not sit idly by when it comes to other interested reject (to discriminate against). </seg>
<seg id="127"> and the Czechs are finally no longer expensive phones than the rest of Europe. </seg>

<seg id="1"> rats have feelings </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> a rat or a Schabe flight in risk means that they also fear? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The neuro scientists Joseph Ledoux is convinced: More animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> But how could one check whether they feel the same, if you like we behave? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Internet magazine 'edge' contributions famous scientists published for several years. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Mirror presented online in a series of selected answers to the question, "What do you think of true, without being able to prove it?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I believe that animals feelings and other awareness conditions, without that I or anyone else this where we have so far proved not to prove that other people aware. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But in this case, we must at least hope, because all human brains the same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But as soon as we turn to other species and issues of sensitivity or raise awareness in general, we are impassable terrain, because the hardware agrees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat in danger, it is the same as many other animals: it is dead, retreats or addresses. </seg>
<seg id="11"> people behave similarly, which some scientists to a comparable subjective experience. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, I do not believe it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult, our subjective experience to the animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> A close almost always with the human consciousness associated circuits for Prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and the executive -/management functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This broad region is much more developed than the people the other primates and seems to lack in all other creatures. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least those aspects of our consciousness that depend on Prefrontal cortex, including the know who we are, and the ability to plan and to decide, there is reason to believe that the man is different from other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> another tragic character, in the linguistic nature of the people: because such a large part of his experiences with language, it has often been said that the awareness is from. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case we could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But even if awareness depended not language, would certainly affect it, so animal awareness, as it may be found, probably very of most of our consciousness-conditions differences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It is difficult to identify, as awareness in other animals may be. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If, as something and subjective, neither judge nor, given the specific hardware, based on our own experience analyse, so his research we face great problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate experiences, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, the scientific should be easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It could be the awareness processes of animals, irrespective of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the Visualisierung. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, moved it on the neural Korrelate awareness rather than on the causal mechanism: they may or may not be identical. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the Prefrontal cortex, for achieving the Visualisierung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What is now for the feelings? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system as the fear in a conscious brain activated its own activity. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we refer to as the "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves, if the activity in the brain Lokalisierten defence system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So, feelings closely linked to those areas of the cortex, the primates and in particular to the people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> together with the linguistic nature is fine we varying degrees of sensitivity, because, with the help of words and grammar distinguish situations and able to categorise it for others as well as ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Antonio Damasio says, for example, that sentiments from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the brain cortex and the tribal similar Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> as this network in the course of human evolution have not changed much, it could be involved in GATT of overarching sentiments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> In theory, I cannot disagree, but I think it is Unbeweisbar. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues that in rats and people like fear appear, is probably in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and people feel the same, if you behave in the same way? </seg>
<seg id="35"> A fleeing Schabe at risk if they fear? </seg>
<seg id="36"> in my eyes can mere behaviour like this does not equal experiences show. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> It helps the neural comparison: rats and people have similar brain tribes, Schaben, not even a brain. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the brain stem is responsible for feelings? </seg>
<seg id="39"> and even if the evidence for the people: as wanted to prove it in rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), feelings. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I do not know how I should prove it. </seg>
<seg id="42"> and because their sentiments will likely radically from our own (as the human consciousness based on specific, and language), Erforsche I prefer the emotional behaviour as the emotional feelings of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> In any case, this progress on the neural level, if we in rats and people the same. </seg>
<seg id="44"> as I Erforsche language and consciousness not in rats, feelings, as I do not know whether they exist. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hispanic voters is a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Bar rack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a typical example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obama's campaign said that "the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students to successfully conclude the school is lower than for White pupils' - which is true. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In order to close the performance gap, recommends Obama's education plan specifically in a bilingual transitional phase in training for those who learn English only. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether its use for the bilingual education, focused on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, to reduce the gap in performance at school. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> take as example "Sixth Street preparatory conference", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The majority of pupils are his panic and come from families with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of the students, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But in 2008 amazing 100 percent pupils of the fourth class the state testing in math at a good level. </seg>
<seg id="13"> also surprising, 93 percent of children from the fourth school in the English test as well. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The astonishing success was achieved with other methods, as those who preferred Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school sixth Street, its focus on exercise, constant monitoring of knowledge and an attitude that tolerated no exceptions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Finally, practice the school approach, after a training in the English-speaking environment. This is the point that Obama should note, the school administrator Linda Mikels. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach attaches importance to the almost Ausschliesslichen use of the English language for teaching. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mrs Mikels, rejects the idea of bilingual education, said, the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil, only about from Mexico. 12 months later would enter school and do not see again. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It works", noted, "It works for us". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> would Obama a school as the "sixth Street preparatory conference" as a model for other schools with great share of Latin American and other English learners pupils? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The performance of the school would make the answer to this question easily, but the educational positions within his own party (the National picture UNSG associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions on Obama's answer is uncertain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While he supports the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue, when he said that people should stop, worried about the "English only" gathering legislation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, he said: "They should make sure that their child can Spanish." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama wants to close the gap in performance, he carefully educational models, the work, rather than to despise and trivialize. </seg>

<seg id="1"> INTERVIEW-the blood that was safe again </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec is one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> and above all it has public confidence restored by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was severely shaken. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As you know, were administered by the Canadian Red Cross blood services national blood reserves during the 1980's with the hi-virus and the Hepatitis C virus contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Given this tragedy and public discontent, the Canadian government in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever led investigation, it aimed to bring light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and directives, in order to prevent another disaster of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judges Krever still delayed, his report, then several provinces, whose objective was a committee on its feet, a new system for managing blood in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> in Quebec, met the committee Gélineau this task. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever in Canada two blood banks: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and Canadian blood society, the other provinces, and the two territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> '1998 Hema-Quebec began their work, had little 38% of people confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr Décary remembers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was daunting. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood and by work in this area during the following years, we have the confidence of the public back ', it says that before they stressed that proud at the beginning of 2008 nearly 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, Dr Décary reserves in the awareness that something is very fragile confidence. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec after the principle of caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This time we saw the number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told the woman who holds the leadership since the 1998 establishment. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "And we had not the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> so when we are on one of the main Krever reports and Gélineau directives, the exclusion, it measures apply, if we do not know this and if the disease progresses slowly, as it appears in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So, in April 1999, no blood of people in more than a month since 1980 had stayed in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, a few years ago without any doubt demonstrated that this disease over the blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This event has shown us that the principle of caution that we apply, is a sense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999, on the market a much more precise technology to identify HIV: the nucleic acid testing (NST), which will make it possible to directly in the blood of the donor prove the existence of the virus itself, and not what the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the hitherto tests. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST allowed to shorten the incubation period between the time the infected person and, if the first viruses through our techniques can be found in blood, said the expert. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it, and we could not see much reduced. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS on a blood transfusion, to reduce significantly. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of with HIV-infected blood. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "In other words, that distribute blood to 12 million, before someone infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Hema-Quebec each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood distributed, it would take more than 24 years, before a case, in the HIV on blood automatic. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that we can now play feel, if you get a blood transfusion or prescribed to restore the health ', says the direct them head of Hema-Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Our challenge for the next ten years is the safety of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows what pathogens can reach into the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year, on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus appeared that, just as the Westnil-virus, transmitted by insects on the blood. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must continuously monitor ', continued Dr Décary, before they stressed that Hema-Quebec alongside a secure supply must also provide a sufficient supply. </seg>
<seg id="33"> ' the growing demand, because the population is ageing. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The treatments for cancer aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells and platelets. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The ageing of the population is also on the average blood donor network that the only 3% of the donations appropriate Quebec. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> Every healthy person, the 18 years or older, and the eligibility criteria, all 56 days, six times a year, blood. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On average, 14% of people, their blood available, not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and who has travelled in a country where malaria is widespread, is excluded from the donations for a year. </seg>
<seg id="38"> "With these 3% we create an inventory, meets the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A lack of supplies are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But we must renew the members of this donor network, if they are older and no longer a blood donations. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, you and make them regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Life is now so hectic that you rarely can take the time to spend an hour in donations', Francine Décary regrets. </seg>
<seg id="43"> with an annual budget of $297 million provides Hema-Quebec not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone marrow transplants, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, the almost exclusively in serious violations of fire. </seg>
<seg id="44"> these tissues are being analysed, processed and frozen before with Hema-Quebec between are stored, which also managed the only public cord blood bank of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord, which was previously seen as biomedical waste, blood is rich in stem cells, which can serve, serious diseases such as leukaemia. </seg>
<seg id="46"> A few weeks ago we celebrated the stockpiling our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan to buy more than a thousand per year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> ' We should start at the beginning of next year, it available for transplants', said Dr Décary on this programme of umbilical cord blood loss describes as very popular. </seg>
<seg id="48"> ' many mothers are convinced, have no access to ', because Hema-Quebec lack the resources, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals offer Quebec. </seg>

<seg id="7"> However, as the process, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defence and very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight to be paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactic of this unequal fight is also often, ruining the defenders, in order to force an amicable settlement, the silence the other side and also discourage any who dares to look again at the issue. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate, she would have must present their view of things before the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In contrast, what works in many of the countries where Barrick Gold, and there is in Canada debates normally through the exchange of ideas, not Knüppelhiebe fought. </seg>
<seg id="11"> So there would have been enough, if the gold mine open its books and files and would open a real debate, by the newspapers, media, publishing and financing independent audit team, bring the light in this issue. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and can the petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada aside with a hand. </seg>
<seg id="13"> could Mr Garver explain how he can also ask for a public debate, but the views of this public scorn? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently the word in the world of vice-president the generous paid lawyers, and not the community all Canadians; a very good Beengte view of the term. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy is the right to speak. Even slanderers </seg>
<seg id="16"> Barrick Gold does not understand or does not wish to understand, is that the public that the authors and publisher of Noir Canada supports this especially because they oppose the brutal attitude of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The public is ready to listen to Barrick and judgments, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework, the commission gave many-action (during the 'consequently debate, Barrick Gold has sent a request to the authors of Noir Canada, they asked, not to use this term ...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, the case of Barrick Gold a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth, the fundamental for any democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It denies totally right, credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which form the basis of the intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it is impossible in a country such as Canada, to discuss issues to investigate and, not like the rich in the world, who else can do? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public and open debate, could this lead by the scientific standards, the authors of Noir Canada have been used. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It has a right to respond. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The university environment we belong, has long known, debates and inconsistencies in the control and to resolve conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> the disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold shows that, contrary to what they claim, has no desire for an open debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time that governments take measures to limit this type of unjustified actions. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The defendants, particularly in organised crime, and grossly negligent damage and business fraud and other criminal activities, including the counterfeiting of documents-accused. </seg>
<seg id="4"> According to prosecutors, the from the tendering Lukrierten used for their own purposes, while the services often with fake bills. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> state funds and subsidies from the government-in HUF 65 million-partly in the coffers of the Organisation Baloldal FIA Valley and in the individual private funds flowed. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As the investigation, were in the tender money fictitious invoices, and the clubs should also not their obligations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to the indictment, a large part of the bills have been falsified. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The blocks were on the market of Józsefváros bought, the around mark was in Kiskunhalas. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The decision about what companies should be issued the bills, was decided on that tour north of Lake Balaton, István Lados sent from János award. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In this "fact-finding tour" should find Lados pensions and restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He asked bills on the Konsumationen later on these proposals based bills for the Youth and Sports Ministry, the social and labour ministry, and the management of Budapest issue. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The majority of these bills should by István Lados and his accomplices, András ri manipulated, according to our information, the latter is responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> One of the aims of Lados' "fact-finding tour" was a beer locally. </seg>
<seg id="14"> As two of contract and carbon bills issued in 2003 is, the catering company the 90-member group of the club Biztos Pont Egyesület meal. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But the head of the company, has such a large group had not fallen into the local at once. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Another account, issued in the summer of 2002, the foundation Jobb Jövért, later known as purely a Harmadik Évezredért, has also serious form and content errors. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, only three rooms, and not more than 10 people can shelter at the same time, according to account should have contained 130 guests. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="19"> As business leaders Gyz Farkas told the Hvg.hu, it was immediately clear that it was counterfeit documents, as the prosecutor during a consultation documents were presented. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "Our firms name and the tax number were on the mark wrong appropriate". </seg>
<seg id="21"> and: Apart from wrong form mistakes was the fact that the operation one hundred people home, after they have eleven rooms, the impossible so many people place. </seg>

<seg id="24"> as during the course of the investigation became known, they also on the bills the VAT, although travel services, which relate to a country outside the EU, VAT free. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The level of VAT was on four from the hotel Révfülöp KFT. The foundation Jobb Jövért issued bills wrong, since the company instead of 25 set off only 15 percent VAT, also issued by the staff exclusively mechanical bills, counterfeit documents, however, were handwritten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Another mistake, "Rechnungslegern" undermine, was that they were in a case 'transport "had stated as performance, although the company specialized in investment will not be offered, the prosecutor's office. </seg>

<seg id="28"> As in the case of Ravenna bt. and the sport camps Kunfehértó, whose business leaders protested, the bills never issued. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The counterfeiters is another "mistakes" in the HIB KFT. from Nyíregyháza undermine: this society was at the time (2001), particularly in the FIA valley Városért dissolution, as the group Egyesület have been eating there-the mass administrators, therefore, the bills have not issued even. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> deliberately falsified </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The other group of accounting Leger, people who have been well aware that you fictitious accounts to. </seg>
<seg id="32"> At the request of the FIA Baloldal valley-Ifjú Szocialisták, the foundation has Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the foundation attempt a Harmadik Évezredért, issued to the tune of about HUF 4 million. </seg>

<seg id="35"> However, there was also little payments as the bills immediately after their exhibition were cancelled, the affected in their documents have forgotten to note. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The third group of accounting Leger covers people directly associated with the defendants. </seg>
<seg id="37"> One of them is Iván Kubatov, The postman of the Ukrainian business leader of the Delta Trió KFT., in Budapest resident, but not to find real fuel-and vehicle trading company. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The company is in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of computer components in the overall value of HUF issued around 18 million. </seg>
<seg id="39"> According to investigative authority, since the 14 September 2005 in cash investment KFT is winding up. Kiskunhalas acts as buyers of these bills. </seg>

<seg id="40"> Business leaders this company was a Romanian, the firms also Iván Kubatov documents should be delivered between 2002 and 2005. </seg>
<seg id="41"> According to our information, Kubatov during the investigation, bills on behalf of the Atlasz GmbH and the clubs and Hoppá, and attempt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány issued and their value even cashed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The firms FA-Bani Jos Faipari KFT. and the Jos-investment bt. should of Romanian Bricklayers Iván Kubatovs explicit request was founded. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In truth, however, was not active, which according to the accused was lack of contracts. </seg>
<seg id="44"> However he could benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplices, prosecutor Zsolt Szente, with the preparation of the firms founding documents was instructed, he on behalf of the companies the bills issued clubs associated with contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> as a whole, Kubatov 15 bills in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the cash investment firms, Delta Trió, FA-Bani Jos, Jos investment and Linaxtrade organisations issued. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The state prosecutor believes that Kubatov each 10% of the amount and the VAT could have cashed. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Kubatov, even the company Szi-far bt. for the exhibition of fictional accounts-in this case, the bills the nominations of Biztos Pont settled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a modern Magyarországért in January 2006 their applications in the voluntary organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA). </seg>

<seg id="50"> This cover-up, they have the TMA five fictitious accounts of works team KFT. presented. </seg>
<seg id="51"> These bills were also in the raid on the offices of Árpád Kemecsei in the education ministry. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="52"> The negotiations, now of some defendants with a confession on the way of accounting fraud, as they have already been filing before the prosecutor,. </seg>
<seg id="53"> This may be a sensation, if the main defendants János award to a full confession. </seg>
<seg id="54"> His previous claims were less detail, and even though he had already promised on several occasions to report fully on everything, is the confession. </seg>
<seg id="55"> So the question remains open, whether this is in its interests, the Socialists a pact with him on the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million and whether contract in return is ready to take on the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="56"> but it is quite possible that award is playing the "insulted", after his requests to mitigate the imprisonment and house arrest were falling on deaf ears. </seg>
<seg id="57"> While other criminals, with economic crimes far greater damage and these have not paid, at large, or at least remains under house arrest, denied this opportunity. Premium </seg>

<seg id="6"> depending on the virus spread the Hepatitis viruses on two different species: Hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, Scheidensekret or spittle). </seg>

<seg id="4"> In the wake of the rather bizarre investigation ever received 12 believers and atheists electric shocks, while they studied a painting of the Mother of God. </seg>

<seg id="6"> Using a brain-scan technology could even be shown that Catholics could activate the part of your brain, which is responsible for the pain regulation. </seg>

<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a picture of the Mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato, in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin". </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the believers would create a kind of religious trance, while you select Vincis picture, because it is not much different from other paintings and reassuring. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The subjects spent the half an hour in an MRI scanner, and a total of 20 electric shocks, this time in four stages, while they either religious or other paintings should look. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Catholics reported that they had at the sight of the Mother of God "in safety" felt as if they "for" and had "calm and peace". </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the Betrachtens religious painting you have about 12% less pain than if they Leonardos work. </seg>

<seg id="25"> Few people register deliberately not at community parties, so that they are nowhere, but also the Google online applications, such as word processor and Grafische tools and RSS feeds, deal with alternative versions, which are linked to a huge Server parks and therefore not generate the best profile the users. </seg>

<seg id="3"> For example, the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> presented at the Ceatec Japan was an astonishing project, in which the Nissan-engineers of Hummeln in creating new accident avoiding systems were inspired. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan's car Biomimetische Robotern managed system of the type Br23c built a mini-car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Air is any bee their own Oval "privacy", is very similar to our own "Shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-Pr and research and development, in the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The eye of the bee together, it in every direction and a corner of about 300 degree can see games play an important role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The role of the composite eye, the researchers the idea of laser-controlled distance knife. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It identifies obstacles in the Br23c in a field of 180 degree within 2 metres, their distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor board, the collision avoided process immediately. </seg>

<seg id="10"> The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the car robots immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees, by the Tyre revolves around the corner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unlike previous systems will take place this manoeuvre purely instinctively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "If it were not so, the car robots could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the laboratory "mobility" and the car robots-project. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system needs to respond immediately and instinctively, because the technology the heart and most vulnerable part of the shield-a class, within the accidents are as inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they avoid other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> and that must be the fraction of a second. </seg>

<seg id="23"> The reduction basically means that if the ministry under a buying auction, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the outgoing head of banks is being pushed into the pension. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In the case of a direct purchases of bad loans, the government aggressively involved to ensure that the managers' salaries not be exaggerated. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had already demonstrated a few days ago, when the House of Representatives against the 700 billion dollar savings package the White House agreed: a big part of the Americans and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than to save the economy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirmed yesterday's edition told the New York Times, which, as the crisis over the Republican party divisions, increasingly divided in their old and moderate east coast-soul, always the state institutions and the business community placements and the neo-conservative, "in Washington," and the financial world is hostile and fifth in the south and the centre of the States electorate. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party owes his rise fifth of voice, I mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This just mentioned example is only a small part of the major changes to the current economic earthquake or even: not only in the United States, throughout the West-and perhaps even beyond this will be affected by this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> in both states, as well as in Europe the crisis seems to speed up the long feared events, which under these new conditions finally shape and come to light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the extraordinary Renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, the crisis a decline of banking and financial institutions, the close links to the outside world and also a huge amount of assets of private households manage, live in a single state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This is a direct political problem for the governments: as it to behave towards the affected families, what a huge mass voters. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis is so global economically, politically it is almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems to be isolated is in and his speech to have lost: the obvious evidence of this has been given by the EU, because its division into different national and international conflicts to find a common path. </seg>
<seg id="12"> So now all with the intervention of the state; rescue plans, new rules, and V. A. distribution of aid funds: since the crisis is serious, only the US economic situation to save without foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="13"> and the resources they have also the legitimacy of using them: two not judgmental conditions, under certain circumstances, on what otherwise is not an international organisation and no market similarly recourse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The new emphasis on the state National element is perfectly compatible with the ever-increasing importance on, the recently in the economy is associated with an intimately related sector: the Territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Paradoxically, it is now, as we were so convinced, long in a networked total-occurred in an increasingly different technologies, of the intangible, that we need to see, as our future but will always depend more on the essential material things: water, harvesting and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> All of these can certainly be transported from one place to the other in the world, but nevertheless extremely closely with a specific piece of earth-a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Why is the one who has such a territory, another, in a Ernteertraglosen, Wasserlosen or oil-free area lives, the advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> that brings me to the second innovation, requires a brief digression. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Anyone who territory and government who policy says, saying leadership. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two complementary phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand there is the knowledge that need strong leader ships, the need for someone who knows how things. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation about the current leaders, including those of the economy, which have zones as inadequate and full shadow arrangement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In addition, a deep-reaching and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, impatience, a picture of futility, a sense of distance, all on a whole class of managers of the western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It seems so convinced in large parts of the population in the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but their ideas world, their way of life, culture in the broadest sense of the word, are, whose salary the majority than others and outdated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand for leadership so feeds bury a diverse but powerful movement the removal of the leaders and the traditional political establishment. This translates into unplanned "revolts" of voters and the sudden reversal of collective mood of the last time, starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the American members rebellion against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value of what today in lower social strata of the West, and reinforced by the financial crisis and on dimension tied up. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In view of all this, simply it would be excessive to talk of a "mass rebellion". </seg>
<seg id="28"> But the eyes wide open, is however there is not. </seg>

<seg id="7"> The figures, which the particular, the main Industry Association, are clear: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas must; this bill paying the lion's share of the cinema in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 and 5 in Palermo in Turin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The areas most affected include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This shows that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, because it is these three regions, in what was recorded the largest number of this modern cinema: with 195 in the last five years, the Lombardy lists, 81, both in Tuscany in the Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The business has evolved in a way that is irrational," Paolo Protti, the president of the particular, "it is useful, that new structures, but on top of the preservation of already existing, for a house in the city are not all its good, instead of the old visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, because of concerns about the old cinemas has decided by an agreement between the community and to protect the particular; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to protect the traditional cinema and support, both in the historic centre, as well as in the periphery. </seg>

<seg id="16"> "It is a good initiative", Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also new design concepts. </seg>
