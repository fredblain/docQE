The psychology of Überbietens - or why we are willing to pay more 
In auctions tend the buyers to spend more and the Feilgebotene thus to exaggerate. 
Neurologists and Wirtschaftsforschern of the University of New York, it is now, the neurologisch-ökonomischen bases this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior. 
According to a "Science" magazine published study want the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not beaten and therefore are willing to pay even excessive prices. 
The researchers have tried the neurological system this "game" with experimental auctions to explore. 
A group of volunteers should play lottery, while attended the other in a encouraging play action - in both cases were active brain regions enrolled functional magnetischer resonance (fMRI). 
Both games got the money, however, it has been increased activity of Striatum, a complex of below the Gehirnrinde, measured at the losers in the auction, in which the script outbid the adversary, plays an important role. 
Among many other functions is this brain region for the "Selbstbelohnung" of the nervous system. 
The researchers said, the price increase could be explained by the avoidance of overreaction of Striatums explain. 
In order to maintain their thesis, have made economists in both the research team additional studies to follow up on the money. 
In this case should three groups against a partners under different conditions organizations had. 
The control group was told the true value of the product, then they have their operations. 
A different group were 15 dollar reward promised, in the case that they winners from the game. 
The third group received $15 before the auction, in the event of a lost game also were lost. 
The difference between the two groups was merely that the emphasis in the one on the profits, while the other is on the losers. 
As evidence of the neurologists expressed hypothesis, but the members of the "against lose" 's games group to higher operations prepared than those in the control or "gains" group. 
"This results derive from any previous economic theory. 
These have at auction saw behaviour only with the joy of the profits, or the risk avoidance. 
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved the imaging neurological processes, and that we now have a third statement giving, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of Wirtschaftsfakultät of the University of New York.
