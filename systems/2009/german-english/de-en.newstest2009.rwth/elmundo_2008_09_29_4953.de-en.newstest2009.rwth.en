In the bedroom talk 
Some children speak at night 
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something, what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep. 
If it happens you for the first time, in the best case will be frightened, but in reality there is no significance. 
This is a positive Schlafstörung, who is speaking in their sleep. 
It is fairly common, especially among children and young people. 
Certainly, was more than one of you that have spoken at night. 
This phenomenon can occasionally (a time in life, such as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day can the child nothing. 
There is no reason this phenomenon. 
Often links with other phenomena in their sleep, such as nightmares, panic at night, Enuresis noctura (Bettnässen at night), speaking in his sleep, but there is no reason why. 
As we mentioned earlier, can it very Fiber, are Stresssituationen or failure. 
In any case, this is a little erforschtes phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it occurs, is very variable. 
It may be that one speaks calmly in individual words, grabbing or it can quite a contrary (cries, wines, long discussions). 
In the cases, if the state very hard, to keep the baby and a specialists to consult, to check whether there is a problem that has caused fear and in this way. 
We have said that it is a positive disruption is, it will not be there, whether it is linked to a different Schlafstörung, which can be treated (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). 
What you can do, is a series of simple preventative measures: 
Try the baby before bed not to. 
So, calm game for the child and avoid stressige television programmes, which are terrible and a little too wild. 
The nervous children, which are recommended Entspannungen, can be applied relaxation techniques to help them, to get some inner calm. 
This helps the child to sleep quietly. 
If the speaking in their sleep again, trying to remain calm. 
Remember that it for the child is harmless and the next day it will be nothing can recall exactly what happened. 
Useful advice 
Weck it does not. 
This is useless, because the child is unconsciously, will take her from the sleep. 
Although the baby speaks, sleep, then built it. 
Remember, though it remains a pair of phenomena anguished shows, it is recommended, to consult, or the reason the child for the fear. 
If they understand what it says (which is not usually is), is not the baby under pressure, an interrogation and discover more information wedges. 
So if you can achieve anything, because if the baby is sleeping, it is not and can not reflect. 
Also, you will hear, as it says, but you do not know what it is dreaming and why it says, so they are cautious about the interpretation of the information and the conclusions, which it. 
Perhaps, says it is not a child, that the night and know his secrets. 
Not even as a joke. 
This causes a lot of fear. 
So, you no worries, it is nothing wrong with it, this is a moment that lasts only a few minutes.
