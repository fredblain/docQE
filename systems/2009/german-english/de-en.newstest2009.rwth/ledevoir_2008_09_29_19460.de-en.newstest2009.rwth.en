The letter - a entehrtes country 
Mr Vic Toews, Ex- 'justice' -Minister (how ironic) cabinet in Harper it was, the last summer say about Louise Arbour to say that it was a "disgrace" for Canada. 
This woman, not a end has led to endless fight for justice and worthy of our admiration deserves, with to cover, says as much about the people to the prime minister around, as Stephen Parker. 
We are dealing with a government that has brought not only from all the countries affected their concentration camps in Guantanamo captive fellow countryman home. 
A government, who did not take into account that Omar Khadr still a young man, as the things crossed him. 
The only government which, despite the fact that Canada the Geneva Convention has signed their word and overlooking a child soldier in inhumane conditions lets. 
The only people who deigns to Justizparodie, to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers argue, Omar Khadr home, so that he gets in Canada a fair trial. 
The government, but also the torture: they are more interested in little that one young adults after so many years of torment for always spiritually broken. 
We are not yet aware, but what we are witnessing an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which Harper constantly as a flag off, and from his mouth as meaningless sounds. 
Arbitrarily imprisoning abuse, torture, and quite it is the time has come, in which there is no morality more: Never ill-treat a Canadian citizens a head of state as, the only now will be supported by the minority (he after 14 October to belong to minority...). 
Many voters feel their salvation in a party to find the virtue, law and order preaches. But they do not see that this government of the, which has the reputation and dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Toews, lies in this Lossagung, and nowhere else.
