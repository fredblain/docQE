In Mexico and without 'peep-toes' 
With British punctuality, at 5: 40 p.m., at the time, the programme was intended, alongside the Präsidialhangars of the airport of Benito Juárez de México DF was finally shelved the plane of the Spanish air force, with the prince and Tin of Asturias travelled. 
The sun went down, but their radiation have forced their hand as Sonnenschirm to use, the royal couple, from the plane ausstieg, to see. 
The gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities 
A few hours before I had a taxi driver in the street, whether he knew that visited the prince and the Fürstin of Asturias the city, to formalise the official trip. 
- Ah, very well, you can at the airport at this time than people take you is from here or 
No, it is the Spaniard, but she has lived a few years. 
-ach so, very good 
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the Tin of Asturias are and know the importance of the trip. 
There are many, waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, the Ehrensalve. 
The prince seems smiling, held in marineblau, and they, the Tin, with long by the wind gewehten hair, without normal 'peep-toes', perhaps told her that it is expected a storm in DF. 
Before they enter the room, smiling and are prepared for the photographers, which is the official entourage. 
At the door of the hotel, in which they are housed, one of the four biggest in the city, is waiting for a Reporterin by Mexican television who like to play games.
