The Sudeten were calling on the United States a plebiscite 
The Sudeten Germans have asked in 1945 at the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes to the United States. 
This is from a letter, the in the collections of Südböhmischen scientific library. 
If we are not part of Germany and Austria, can we at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire to be in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans to US President have approached. 
This is from a letter, which has been preserved in a Privatarchiv and kept the today in the collections of Südböhmischen scientific library. 
The Germans of Krumau ask in the letter from the American president, the return of the "Sudetengaus" - on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler was taken - to Czechoslovakia not allow. 
"We have the situation properly understood and want us really the words to be sure that the American units not as oppressors and enemies German territory, but as liberators," it says, in a letter, with the words "people, which the fate of the Sudeten on herzen lies" sign. 
Since joining the Czechoslovakia the Sudeten Germans - in the Czech national character - suggests that it brutality, reckless, incomprehension, oppression and slavery would expect, the author of the letter and the American President, for today and in the Schutzherrschaft on the Bohemian Forest. 
"We can't believe that you credit without regard to the view of a quarter-million people in this area to us foreign state, oppressed minorities and to eliminate tried and nothing on the victory of Allies has contributed," is in the letter read. 
The reason why the author can sign is supposedly the fear Rachegelüsten of the "Czech oppressors". 
If the US president expressed doubts about the affiliation of Böhmerwalddeutschen cherish, whether it be sufficient, if he Böhmerwaldgau a referendum in motion, whether the part of the United States or under the Schutzherrschaft of the United States live. 
Although the text of the letter in the post-war may sound a little naïve tonight, that he is, however, some say witness a good picture for the expectations of Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least guessed, that we had on their return from the Republic would negotiate, only a few of them such a possibility at all. 
Some waited, that would negotiate the United States and Britain for the Sudeten autonomy for them. 
Others believed others, they could simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The also confirmed the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis. 
He was at war as Budweiser a German in the navy in the Baltic Sea. 
When he looks at the end of the war in British captivity came and placed him in a Kriegsgefangenenlager after Holstein, were dozens of other beings most Germans to him that he should teach them to Czech. 
"She reasoned that if they heimkämen, were to try them come the Czech," Chalupa. 
Nobody in the German prisoners of war, before the war in Czechoslovakia had lived, had his view that he would be on the basis of the Beneš-Dekrete from the Republic of drive.
