Intelligent car imitate the flight of the Hummel 
What would be the best method for development of new technologies for accident avoidance, if not the Hindernis-Sensoren from nature to imitate? 
For example, the bees. 
In the CEATEC in Japan was a startling project, in which the Nissan-Ingenieure of Hummeln in the establishing new accident vermeidender systems were inspired. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University has Nissan of Autorobotern foreign-backed built biomimetische system from BR23C, a Mini-Auto, equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. 
In flight is any bee their own, oval "privacy," our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, Produktmanager for Technologie-PR and research development, in the exhibition. 
The line-up of the bee that can see in every direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees, plays an important role. 
The function of the buzz if ratings, the researchers the idea of the lasergesteuerten Abstandsmessers on. 
It identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a slanting of 180 degrees within 2 metres, calculated their distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor on board, of the kollisionsvermeidenden process. 
The barrier will in seconds Bruchteilen registered, and the Autoroboter alter the course, the movement of bees, is the tyres around the corner. 
In contrast to previous systems will take place this ploy purely instinctively. 
"If it were not so, might not react the Autoroboter quickly enough to avoid the obstacles here," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory (TRL)" and Autoroboter-Projektes. 
The system must react instinctively immediately, because this technology to the most intimate and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer, within the accidents still as inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they other bees. 
And that must be a split second. 
But can the fudge, in contrast to the bees, not up, down, or even diagonal be done - it can only two, and then only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit of tyres. 
While bees here infinitely many opportunities to avoid other bees, the researchers at the Autoroboter only the Drehbewegung, or of speeding up and Abbremsens. 
The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, which are easier and more efficient, and therefore a longer life than traditional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. 
Andoh declared, it is the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on processing the data, and even less to the ability to store them. 
This device must per second only inputs and appropriately respond to them. 
It needs to store them, or on previous manoeuvres a intuitive, logical reaction produce, and it has just a handful KB Memory in. 
There is no need Gigabyte- and Megabyte-schwerer Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate Kollisionsvermeidungstechnologie, which will be in Nissan within the next ten years they set out in production. 
Another application could find the technology in the GPS-Satellitennavigation find by motorists aware of barriers around and it so.
