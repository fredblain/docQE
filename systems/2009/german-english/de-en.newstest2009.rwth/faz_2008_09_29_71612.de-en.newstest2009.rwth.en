Düsseldorfer hope lies in Frankfurt 
In words lacking in the letter from the WestLB-Vorstands to the staff of the House. 
By a bringing units of the Düsseldorfer money Institute with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank "could be the central Kapitalmarkthaus the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", it says on Monday revealed letter. 
The WestLB would be a "Kompetenzblock" with sustainable profitability in such a deal. 
And could such a link the future Bündelungen in Landesbankensektor be. 
So reads it wants to demonstrate a governing board at a difficult time to act. 
Because the folding WestLB remains under tremendous pressure. 
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Finanzdienstleistung supervision, which has made it clear the nordrhein-westfälischen country government recently, pushing the time to find a solution for the future. 
From a as any link between the Deka-Bank, the Sparkassenkunden because of their Investmentsfonds know, and the WestLB is for some time - also in Frankfurt. 
Although has told Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas during the presentation of the Halbjahreszahlen end of August, in a merger of the House to the Mainzer highway with a Landesbank, around the Helaba or WestLB, he would make no sense. 
But the Board of the Deka, which is half from each of the state banks and the Sparkassenverbänden, asked the board, with the WestLB talks on joint business activities. 
This could be the Kapitalmarktgeschäft or parts of it. 
The talks have yet, as it says on financial centre, only just begun. 
By the Deka-Bank who, with their 3,000 staff to more important employers on financial centre of Frankfurt, is not the first time the speech, when it comes to consolidation in Sparkassensektor. 
2003 it looked for a moment that would merge the Deka-Bank with the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba. 
This Dreierbund was nothing. 
Hardly had plans became public, the Hessische Land government against the Helaba about. 
The two other houses were not there. 
The Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But it has repeatedly thought through a combination of Deka-Bank with regional banks. 
Least had, however, Günther Merl, CEO of the Helaba, spoke out against overstatement about a rapprochement with his house. 
Regardless, it seems to mature, but the knowledge that a pattern to the various houses of the public sector is needed. 
Now that the Landtagswahl in Bavaria is over, could begin connecting the BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg radical. 
For the Helaba this is not necessarily good news. 
Should increase the pressure to further mergers, they are the after partner for. 
In the south would only junior partner, although she has i.e., the financial crisis so far, far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A rapprochement with the West LB has the well catered Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with 85 percent of the Helaba is involved, at the beginning of the year. 
If anything, the North LB. 
Such strategic considerations but only one side. 
On the other, there is the question of how the different business models of individual houses with each other. 
In June, said Merl, the crucial question, which should ensure business model the Zukunftfähigkeit of the regional banks, was not answered by Germans catered and Giroverband hitherto. 
In the end may also be a dismantling West LB, which is not, however, of course. 
Indeed, in the letter of the boardroom, it will be a "solution" for the house. 
As with a combination of individual entities with the Deka-Bank under one hat, will tell.
