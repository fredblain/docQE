What has been produced in the Rechnungsfabrik of contract & Co? 
On October 8 the negotiations begin in criminal proceedings against János substrate and his accomplices. 
The defendants will particularly in the organised crime, and grossly reckless damage and Geschäftsbetrug, and other offences - including counterfeiting of documents -. 
According to prosecutors were used the competitions from capitalized resources for their own purposes, while the provided were services often with fake invoices. 
Public spending and subsidies from the government - HUF 65 million - and in the coffers of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, be spent partly in the Privatkassen an individual. 
As the investigation known, made when the Ausschreibungsgelder fictitious accounts, and the clubs are their duties also failed. 
According to indictment is a large part of the bills have been falsified. 
The Rechnungsblöcke were on the market by Józsefváros bought, the Rundsiegel it allowed in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision, which will be issued firms the bills, was on the trip north from Lake Balaton, was sent to the István Lados of János substrate. 
In this "fact-finding tour" should Lados pensions and restaurants. 
He asked bills on the Konsumationen, later on these proposals based bills for the youth and Sportministerium, social and employment, and the self-governance of Budapest to be. 
These bills are mainly by István Lados and his accomplices, have been manipulated András Őri, which is representing our information for the Constitution of those reports. 
One of the objectives of Lados' "fact-finding tour" was a Bierlokal. 
As two of the contract and is Co in 2003 issued bills, the Gastronomiebetrieb the neunzigköpfige group of associations Biztos Pont Egyesület meal. 
But now is the head of the livestock, such a large group had not at once in the restaurant hineingepasst. 
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, later known as Együtt Wyatt Harmadik Évezredért, was also serious violation and Inhaltsfehler on. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, the only three rooms and no more than ten people at the same time maintain can, according to the account 130 guests. 
The imagination of Rechnungsfälscher were set seems equally no limits, as the Pigal Kft. was involved, a Gastronomiebetrieb, in whose accounting records of customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá according present public prosecutor not to be seen. 
As business leaders Győző Farkas the hvg.hu, told he was immediately clear that it was forged documents, as he presented by the Public Prosecution Service during a consultation documents were submitted. 
"Our Firmenname and the tax number were on the mark wrong appropriate". 
And further: apart from procedural irregularities was also the fact that the farm 100 people sheltering, after all, eleven Zimmer, the impossible so many people place. 
Also was also on the bill, it is not the restaurant for some time now. 
The diligent account counterfeiters have also failed to check that their target of Budapest travel agency exclusively travel abroad, and so have indicated they Ungarn-Reisen on the cash, which was also the Rechnungslegungspraxis of the company. 
As in the course of the investigation became known, they have the bills including VAT, although Reisebüroleistungen, which relate to a country outside the EU, mehrwertsteuerfrei are. 
The level of VAT was generally to four by the hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért issued bills wrong, because the 25 15% VAT charges, will also be prepared by the staff only mechanical bills, the false documents were by hand. 
Another mistake, the Rechnungslegern "undermine was, was that in one case" goods transport "as comes had stated performance, although it is not offered by the investment advice specialist firm, said the prosecutor. 
Further irregularities - wrong Rechnungsformat, false mark - was that the Együtt Wyatt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and XXI. Could be exposed századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued bills as forgeries debunked. 
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Sportlager Kunfehértó, protested the manager, the bills were never issued. 
Another "mistakes" made the counterfeiters in the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001), particularly at sunset, when we have eaten the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület there - the Masseverwalter were consequently, not the bills themselves. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other group Rechnungsleger are people who have been well aware that they fictitious invoices. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták has the Foundation has Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation Együtt Wyatt Harmadik Évezredért, in a of about HUF 4 million issued. 
According to indictment was the executive director of the Collab Kft. by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, for issuing the fictitious invoices. 
The moment in winds up being Biogate Kft. is to have worked with premium and Co: in 2003, the GmbH, the Foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, and the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit bills in a total of HUF 5 million, which is not to provide related services. 
However, there was also little money, as were cancelled the bills for exhibition, which have forgotten the group in its documents to be recorded. 
The third group of Rechnungsleger encompasses people brought directly with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of Ukrainian business leader of the delta Trió Kft., in Budapest resident, but not auffindbaren issue where fuel and Fahrzeughandelsfirma. 
The company is in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of EDV-Komponenten in total of HUF approximately 18 million issued. 
According to the investigative body is to have the since 14 September 2005 in liquidation or cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas as buyer these bills. 
Directors of that company was a reason that should be delivered to the Firmendokumente also of Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information has been Kubatov during the investigations, bills on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, issued and Együtt Wyatt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and whose value to themselves. 
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are believed to have been founded by exclaimed bricklayers - on Iván Kubatovs point. 
In truth, however, was not firms active, according to the accused to the lack of contracts. 
Still benefit from the companies: request his accomplices, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was charged with the preparation of the Firmengründung documents, has issued on behalf of the companies' bills with award in the clubs, such as in Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
As a whole Kubatov 15 bills in a total of HUF 14,2 million on behalf of the companies raise cash investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, have issued Jos investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations. 
The prosecution argues that could have cashed Kubatov each 10% of the Rechnungssumme and VAT. 
Kubatov Vorrang haben even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case were settled the bills the nominations of Biztos Pont. 
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség Wyatt Modern Magyarországért have in January 2006 suggested in the voluntary organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA"). 
Both were ever 500,000 Ft, have genütztVVPP highjacked these amounts. 
In order to cover it up, they have the TMA five fictitious invoices the Works team Kft. presented. 
These bills were seized in the raid on the offices of Árpád Kemecsei in Unterrichtsministerium ensured. 
In the negotiations will now by some defendants with a confession on the in the Rechnungsfälschung, as they have already before the public prosecutor's office filed were expected. 
A sensation could be, if chooses the Hauptangeklagte János substrate to a comprehensive confession. 
His previous claims were less detailed, and although he had already promised, to report on everything, his confession. 
The question remains unanswered, whether it is in its interests, whether the Socialists a pact with him have on the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether premium in exchange, agreed to take responsibility. 
But it is quite possible that winning the "sulking" plays after his requests to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest on deaf ears. 
While other criminals who, with financial crime far greater damage and that they are not paid, at large, or at least placed under house arrest, denied substrate that possibility.
