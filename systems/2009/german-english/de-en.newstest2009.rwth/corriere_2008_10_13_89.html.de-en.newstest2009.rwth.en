The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already issued a few days ago, as the Chamber of Deputies against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket of the White House agreed: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in the to punish Wall Street than to save the economy. 
This confirmed yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported how divided the crisis in Laufschritt, the Republican Party, the Republican Party the increasingly divided in their old and moderate East Coast-Seele, which the state institutions and the business community and the neo-conservative, "which in Washington, and the financial world hostile reception and particularly in the south and centre of the states electorate. 
This part of the party owes his rise particularly the voice, I referred to above. 
This just now is only a small part of the big changes before the current economic earthquake or even already: not only in the United States, even in the West and perhaps even on this, will be affected by these. 
In both states, as well as in Europe seems the crisis which has long feared events to speed up what, in these new conditions finally take shape and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the extraordinary renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
In fact, means the crisis the decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close connections to the outside and at a huge amount of assets of individuals, who live in one state. 
This means a direct political problem for governments: as it promised the families to do, what a great Wählermasse constitute. 
The crisis seems economically globally, political campaign is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems so itself put to one side and his right to have lost: the obvious proof is given by the EU, which, because of their division into various national and knows international conflicts, a common path to know. 
Therefore expect all now with the intervention of their own country; rescue plans, the new rules, and particularly of aid distribution fund: since the crisis increasingly serious, only the US in the economic situation without foreign aid to save. 
And apart from the resources they have to use it also this: no two to überwertende preconditions, in what otherwise no international organisation and no market in a similar way use. 
The new emphasis on the staatlich-nationale element, is in well with the ever-increasing importance, which recently in the economy with a closely related sector in: the territoriality. 
Paradoxical way it is now, as we were so moved into a networked Gesamtreich to be, in a kingdom of increasingly sophisticated technologies, non-material, realising that at once, as will depend on our future but more and more from the essential material things: water, harvest and oil. 
These can be transported, certainly all from one place to the other in the world, but with a narrowly defined piece earth - a territory. 
It is the one who has such a territory, another, in a ernteertraglosen, lives wasserlosen or from oil free area, have an advantage. 
I now turn to the second novelty, but the move. 
Who territory, who government, who says policy, saying leadership. 
In that sense, I think the financial crisis two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand there is the recognition of the need for the prestigious Leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how things. 
On the other hand there is now a wave of indignation at the current leaders, particularly those of the economy, as inadequate and full Schattenzonen increasingly showing. 
There is a deeper cuts, and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distant, all to a whole class of managers of Western countries. 
It seems to find the perception among large sections of the population, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but their Ideenwelt, their way of life, culture in the widest sense of the word, whose salary the majority always as foreign and outdated. 
The demand for leadership feeds therefore below a diverse but powerful movement the removal of the leaders and the old political establishment, this translates into unplanned "revolts" of the electorate and sudden change of collective heart condition last time, starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the American politician for Bush (and perhaps also plays the victory of the rights in Italy here). 
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectuals creditors, some would say its format, more and more communication problems and therefore less representative value on, which in the lower social strata of the West and is driven by the financial crisis deepened and to Überdimensionalität being driven. 
Given all this, it would be quite excessive, "the masses". 
The eyes but to keep track of is certainly not.
