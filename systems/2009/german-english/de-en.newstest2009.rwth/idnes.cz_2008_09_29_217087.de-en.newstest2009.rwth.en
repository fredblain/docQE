The first virtual providers is already this year in the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite perfected, the Czech providers offering virtually all the services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe. 
But what is missing here - a virtual providers, of the classic to lower prices. 
Perhaps this will not be long in coming. 
For the Czech mobile phone operators to the most expensive in Europe, we have also often on Mobil.cz reported. 
This confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, who pointed out that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the final steps of the European Commission in regulation of roaming charges it is as likely to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators will text message from the Ausland be cheaper than at home. 
How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe are so high? 
The answer is simple, there is the competition, which really is a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical in Czech, there are three mobile networks and a Penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone operators rant gladly, however, that it on the Czech market much competition. 
The share is often the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, the often expressed in the past, that there was no place in the Czech Republic for another supplier. 
It is likely that not a classic providers with their own network so many opportunities (would find it probably hardly frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility - a virtual providers. 
The entry of virtual providers on the mobile phone market brought a strong price reduction, in which had then take the traditional mobile phone operators. 
There was even before the advent of such firms such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain similar votes as in the Czech Republic. 
However, it turns out that it for such providers place and that they can be successful. 
Incidentally, needs to not long after examples. 
In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. 
In just half a year it turned the supplier, more than 100 thousand customers to win and for fünfgrößten providers in the country. 
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, the Czech Republic, among other things, U: fon possesses. 
The advantage of virtual providers is, therefore, that much more specific target group. 
In order to function effectively, need virtual providers much less customers as a classic providers. 
They need not relatively high costs for construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world are joining the virtual providers are usually seen as Low-Cost-Firmen heraus - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which, often from a less extensive service Leistungsangebot begleitet wird. 
Providing such as Tesco Mobile in Britain SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
As demonstrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move, not to put on a klischeehafte target group. 
Those suppliers is: specifically to men. 
"True just choose Mobilking - the supplier who they like and whom they can trust," David Seibert, the chief executive of the Mobile entertainment Company, the company this virtual prey. 
It's hard to say whether it would take a similar concept as in Poland, Czech Republic. 
Doubts also the official press Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is a market segment in which the most virtual providers, relatively small. 
It is from the perspective of the service Leistungsangebots relatively saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic a chance, my mobile telephone providers 
But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile phone operators conquered the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking. 
"We talk about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations were not hope. 
It will be more of a market entry of Mobilking in other countries in our region, "he says in a phone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, Pressesprecherin the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly confirming it so that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic this idea. 
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that there is not a potential competitor. 
Their interest in a launch of a virtual Mobilfunkanbieters shows for some time, the group GTS Novera, which would like to take a further step, in order to be a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area Firmenkunden. 
"We have an interest in our customers not only fixed, but also Mobilfunk-Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen to offer. 
And the sooner the better. 
This possibility we have negotiated repeatedly with all Czech incurred by customers. 
Some of them we have already negotiating progress, "the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times. 
With no official information that is expected to be the first virtual providers perhaps by the end of the year. 
But is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. 
"At this moment, we do not imagine that, in the Czech Republic for a full virtual providers. 
The Czech market points to other markets big specifics. 
Has contacted us yet no subject with a complex and serious project in this area, "says in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
For the specific nature of the Czech market also include other providers. 
The Pressesprecherin of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement of O2 added: "So far we have not yet viable and mutually advantageous project, which could continue building." 
And adds: "In network of T-Mobile will come before the end of the year was hardly a virtual providers. 
At this moment, we would have been have a practical way, in order to think so short term can. " 
Vodafone is its attention more to meet the demands of its own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav Čepický thinks: "For negotiations with potential virtual operators are we open, particularly in the field division of costs and infrastructure. 
This is exactly what we see from the perspective of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in search of a partner to create a shared network for a fast mobile Internet. " 
The competent authorities, with the hand in hand 
The mobile phone operators is easy to understand, another supplier would be more competition, that would lead to lower prices and also to the profits. 
So why should facilitate a competitors from entering the market? 
That the providers, when it comes to something, illustrates the long trek to the emergence of U: fon. 
Probably the strongest in ČTÚ was at that time, U: fon came on the market, by society T-Mobile. 
It also publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ-Webseiten. 
But now stands just U: fon than argument why a virtual providers should not allow. 
Martina Kemrová said: "The Konkurrenzumfeld of the mobile phone market was recently by entering the market a fourth Mobilfunkanbieters strengthened. 
In light of the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that would include a new player in the market itself and above all his services high demands. " 
Given this approach the mobile phone operators surprised the absolute lack of Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is not the attitude of the ČTÚ, in Czech, unfortunately, in contrast to Britain and other developed countries - not the competence in the economic competition. 
Has this exclusively the for the protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). 
This but referred to this whole issue its very typical attitude. 
"Market entry of a virtual Mobilfunkanbieters would then be possible, it is a contract between a mobile phone operators and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
So far there has been no such contract completed, because offering potential stakeholders was probably for the traditional operators not sufficiently interesting, "in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa by the external relations department of the ÚOHS. 
Representatives of the companies would not be surprising, such an approach. 
By one authority, which represent the interests of consumers and to make, among other things, that none of his position in the market, this is more than worrying. 
In particular, add Kristián Chalupa adds: "In Ausland, where work virtual providers quite normal, is to observe that its market entry to a price reduction in mobile telephone services". 
But probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price reduction to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Really shocking is in this case the almost touching line the three mobile phone operators, stemming from their reactions. 
The question of whether it was a coincidence. 
Just as the same petrol prices at the pumps sure only by chance and a hard competition. 
"The authority has discovered in this matter no evidence to suggest that a competition; action, and it also has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. 
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he has not the appropriate increased responsibility for his actions in the market. 
The tools for opening the mobile telephone market for virtual providers may lack also the regulatory authority for telecommunications, Chalupa in his statement. 
The interpretation of a dominant position in the market is one of many points. 
There are of course an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÚ, after the telecommunications in the view of the economic competition a single market. 
In such a market has of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators a dominant position. 
Some legal experts but offer a different vision - for access to the market a virtual supplier is always the approval of the network operator. 
And the mobile phone operators - logically - for its network the monopoly. 
That means that he is taking in a particular segment necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if this argument not able, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone operators striking resemblance. 
This show complaints a number of interested parties (including the society GTS Novera) that they are in negotiations with all providers in very similar obstacles. 
The drain on the ČTÚ is in telecommunications services a fairly common trick, the ÚOHS by the whole affair. 
This was observed in a number of similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it is not in the recently decided to amend the legislation expanding the powers of the ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts from an improvement in the situation had promised. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS know only too well, but probably they have other interests. 
It is, if nobody watching 
Unseen until the operation of any pseudovirtueller providers, of which there are in the Czech mobile networks several. 
There are companies that spend their own price lists for mobile telecom services, which are only partly publicly. 
It is usually because firms operating in the area Multilevel-Marketing. 
Own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. 
The price lists companies arrive normally only to select. 
The joke of the matter is that the company with the operators as a classical Firmenkunde occurs, the orders a large amount of SIM cards. 
As important customer he then special price offers (and other services). 
The problem is that the conditions of all Czech operators a similar sales ban. 
"If there are some cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions, we will be dealing with it, which can lead to a break-up of cooperation with the society," said Martina Kemrová to our question on this problem. 
But it is unlikely that gets something in the upper echelons of the mobile phone operators. 
Particularly in the case of the three mentioned firms can be thousands of customers. 
No operator resists, however, such an approach. 
From the activity of these firms spent they forgettable profits, it - unlike the real virtual suppliers - not through the official marketing. 
Potential problems is Miroslav Čepický closely: "The law allows these types of speculation, despite all the service companies, only a very small percentage of customers. 
This must accept that the SIM-Karte in her telephone not on their behalf, so they can not reason as ordinary customers of the mobile phone operators ". 
That alone but should be the ČTÚ strange to say the least. 
Besides an issue for the ÚOHS. 
The mobile phone operators in this way, why are they against a virtual providers? 
It added that the ÚOHS for detecting such activities fairly strong powers, and if they do not, it must not with the statement of the providers, they know nothing about it and its business conditions it is prohibited,. 
When the Czech Republic more at is 
As the text has already been said, the market virtual providers a sharp price drop in the various services. 
Have practically in all countries, where virtual providers, the traditional operators tried, which virtually more or less. 
The arguments were virtually identical - a small, or very gesättigter market, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
In advanced countries but, in these moments, the regulatory bodies, not the interests of the mobile phone operators, but to keep trying to their customers. 
Whether through formal or informal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator, and this was followed by further. 
Unfortunately, throw the Czech regulatory agencies throughout the case like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience we can help get rid of that uncertainty over the powers in these cases is good. 
But we will be throwing in the towel none. 
If the background and soon a virtual providers, will be the Czech mobile market may soon moving again. 
If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual Mobilfunkanbieters leaves the ÚOHS not remain inactive, wenn es darum geht, further interested parties reject (to discriminate against). 
And the Czechs will stop expensive phone than the rest of Europe.
