The Superkleber, the walls due leaves 
The forces of gravity, thanks to a Klebstoffes to defeat and walls hochklettern to as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems almost reached that goal. 
With one of only 2.5 qcm disgruntled Kleber it is the researchers have succeeded 100 kilos body on a senkrechten wall to fix. 
The STUDIO - has a US magazine, the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory published. 
Of the research team was invented material is a further development of already used in glues, what a special Kohlenstoffstruktur, named Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"The principle of Klebers can be as a series to a pile of spaghetti rely tubes," said Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists were inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which is covered by mikroskopischen Härchen are, which the animal a perfect stop. 
The various materials such as glass Teflon and Schleifpapier carried out tests have shown that the new Kleber ten times stronger than the Haltefähigkeit feet of reptiles and "easily by the wall removed leaves," Liming Dai, researchers, the School of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
In MAUERN ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could as deciduous glue between used", Liming Dai. 
About as Spiderman to walls emporzugehen? Perhaps, but the researchers think more reminiscent of a less fascinating benefits, such as the combination of electrical appliances, because the Nanoröhrchen are as head of heat and electricity. 
Other areas of application could be in the area of space. 
For the moment the Superhelden therefore still waiting. 
The ANDERE ART DER FORSCHUNG - including the University of Berkeley, California, is a new Kleberart. 
In an article in the American Chemical Society show the Californian scientists a glue from Mikrofasern the as hair by movement on a surface itself by dust and it is always a perfect liability.
