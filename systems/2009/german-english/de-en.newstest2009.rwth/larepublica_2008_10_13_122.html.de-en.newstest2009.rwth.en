Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso - the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinemas to close because of the beneficiary Multiplexkinos. 
"A city with no cinemas is a blind city, as a face no eyes." 
This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect as now in the large urban centres, and in the provinces. 
The process of exclusion cinemas, which began with the birth of large Multisaalkomplexe in the periphery, in the long term death Einsaalkino centre. A process that seems not only inevitable and irrevocable, but also a cultural crime. 
Are mostly historical sites reminders, "it is like to lose a friend, which has made it a little streets full of emotion," the director of the film "Japan--devoted Cinema Paradiso" him 20 years ago, Oscar and the high price of Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and whose nostalgia, what it is, in a well for ever lost cinema world to live. 
The figures, which Anec, the central Gewerbeverband, speak a clear language: in the last five years have had to reach the vast quantity of 316 traditional cinemas; this bill paid most the lion ’ s share of the cinema in the main cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
To the most affected regions included the Emilia-Romagna with 82 of cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This is evidence that are the main culprits the Multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions, in which there was the largest number of this modern cinema registered: with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy which lists, 81 are both in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has developed in an irrational manner," Paolo Protti, the President of the Anec, "it is useful that are also new structures, but is the maintenance of the already exist, because it includes a room in the city, they are not all its habitués willing, instead of the old one Multiplexkino in the periphery. 
And here there is the lack of budget for the fund of Gewerbeverbands äußer eight states: the state's debt burden is 10 million. 
It is a disgrace from an ethical standpoint, that the government is not the existing laws. 
The sector to be, between 16 and 18 million per year of needs ". 
What is interesting is the case of Bologna, Italy's first city, which, because of the fears of the old cinemas, has decided that an agreement between the community and the Anec to protect; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to traditional cinemas to protect and support, and both in the historic centre, as well as in the periphery. 
Among the expected measures are also tax Bevorteilungen for the Kinobetreiber and benefits for the audience on the transport: it will be allowed in the verkehrslimitierten areas of the centre to drive and also to lower parking fees to park. 
"It is a good initiative," Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that will join other cities our example and further new concepts. 
Certainly but we also need a better audio and Videoausstattung, in order to facilitate against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle something because, after all, is the audience of more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinemas for me is always a topic: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, place my childhood and youth, was the tipping point that moved me, "'s cinema Paradiso", even though I for 10 years with the idea had been playing. 
For 25 years, I live in Rome; if I Rialto or on Quirinale in the Via Nazionale vorübergehe, where I saw so many different emotions, but I side on, not the staubbedeckten posters to see.
