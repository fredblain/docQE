In this edition of "Education Watch" discuss Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates to bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and a senior director in Bildungswissenschaften to the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class, a Schulauswahl needs". 
Hispanic voters to address is a complex task. 
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a case in point. 
Obama's campaign, "the likely Afro-American and Hispanic pupils the school a success, it is lower than in white pupils' - and what is true. 
To close the achievement gap, Obama Bildungsplan specifically among other bilingual footnote in the training for those English only learn English. 
But there is the question to Obama about his commitment to the bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, to reduce the gap in the performance. 
Take, for instance, "Sixth Street" In, "a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of which have only recently in the country are, learn English. 
But in 2008 a staggering 100 per cent of pupils in the fourth category of the Staatsprüfung in math on a good footing. 
Also surprising were 93 per cent of children from the fourth school year in the Englischprüfung evaluated as such. 
This astonishing success was achieved with other methods, than those who are favoured by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street a specific focus on verification and exercise, to steady control of knowledge and an attitude which tolerates no exceptions. 
The case, the school's approach, which the training in an English-language surroundings. This is precisely the point to note the Obama, the Schulleiterin Linda Mikels. 
This approach sets great store by almost ausschliesslichen use of English in Fachunterricht. 
Mrs Mikels, which the idea of bilingual education, said to me, the school had a remarkable success with a pupil who was only about from Mexico. 12 months later would deny the schoolroom enter and not be able to identify. 
"It works," said, "it works for us". 
Would Obama a school such as the "Sixth Street" In "as a model for other schools with great proportion of Latin American and other English learning pupils? 
The school would make the answer to this question, but the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support has long been the idea of bilingual education), and his own unstinting support for the bilingual education make predictions about Obama's response. 
The point, that immigrants English should learn, he has recently the subject trivialized, he said, that people should stop worrying about the "only English" any legislation. 
Instead, he said: "They are designed to ensure that your child Spanish". 
If Obama's achievement gap actually wants to close, he carefully educational models take into account which work, rather than to them and to trivialize.
