Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to present the first day of the Tachibana Highschool, to kichern the girls: Deutsche is totally "kawaii"! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana knows that word from Mangas - in the new Austausch-Log retold from Japan. 
"The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before the school I had Bammel. 
I live on the edge as witnessed in Kawasaki and move 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool. 
The way I had to find myself alone, fortunately, I have not. 
The starting class seems determined not Tachibana as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils trudeln onwards eight p.m., until twenty above nine a brief Besprechungsrunde with the teacher begins, the 'home venture. 
But before the teaching began, I was in the, me. 
I am not the type, the like to talk to people, even from a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I had no uniforms, I have an old rock my Gastmutter, this blouse, blue knees assets and black leather shoes. 
In this lift I before the rostrum and sought, everything right to say: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I Sylvana, come from Germany, and in a week of birthday. 
At the time, I was very happy that I had got off more than two years ago, to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the classes have all getuschelt, sniggering and gewunken and all I have the word "Kawaii". 
The knew I from my Mangas. 
It is a means to ignore vocabulary Japanese girls and means' nice, sweet '. 
Then gehuscht I quickly at my place. 
The girls beside me has gegrinst much gegrinst, they thought it was a privilege that the Austauschsch√ºlerin alongside her should be. 
The rest of the day was relatively quiet, but as the Gong was, I was really have been. 
All were confused and kicherten and asked me holes in the gut - it is really difficult, Japanese English to understand. 
In the break packten then all their Bentos from. 
My Gastmutter had me such a box - this was something other than the vapid German Pausenbrote. 
I had rice with herbs, small trucker, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in Tofumantel. 
Mostly I have not got a clue what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The matter is strange and taste completely original. 
What is clear is that everything really lecker is. 
Well, up to the salty pausing plums, perhaps, brrrr! 
The Bentos are in Japanese schools not only lunch. 
It is sometimes that a girl a boys a even share Bento notes, which they particularly artfully herrichtet - in the hope that the boys in Pausensnack closer. 
This is something I have read in my Manga-Comics. 
I am curious, I can watch it here. 
'Why because Japan?', I have my asked, as I said that I, for one year in Tokyo to go to school. 
I have always said: 
"Because it is now." 
Finally I read for years on Mangas. 
And the comics and the culture is better understand, I have at some point, a bit in Japanese to learn. 
For me it was obvious that I eventually here had. 
Because I also have a penchant for tradition and customs. 
And the judging this great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well lost I felt not here, even if it is Tokyo's biggest city I have ever seen. "
