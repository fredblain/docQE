Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
On the 'emerging Technology Conference' kind of MIT, Microsoft the advance of new Bilderkennungssystems and the Mensch-Interaktion presented, a creature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but what is able to do some primitive tasks, such as a taxi to order (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a Routenplaner, on the campus of the company to get). The system does what it during the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a violation and Gesichterkennungssystem, can this' Rezeptionistin ', how many people are in the area, who they are and even as they were there to listen to and understand the key their entertainment. 
It may also present the talks in the groups. 
In remarks delivered video noticed the Rezeptionistin 'a third person, but she understands that this person belongs to the group, which is associated with it, is not, and that is not Firmenangestellter.

This is the future. 
Now the company has better things on which it can concentrate, for example, at the next version of its Betriebssystems Windows. 
This week they talked very superficial on the change of strategy of Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be and do not have as many particularly programmes.

Everything is just a statement, given that Microsoft Windows versions one or other function and 'extras' ever. 
The shift is worth 
The Microsoft is right, the operating system loses in importance, as well as the software. 
As did Google chromium in network appeared, it was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google, struggling to compete with Windows. 
Sent many point out that the browser no operating system is. 
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to ensure that hardware and software at the same time. 
The operating system meets the function, with the role his wife or their husband cannot be compared, wenn es darum geht, his mother-in-law something to say. 
This is true. 
The system will never disappear, but must be made to its' death ', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth, think. 
What Ballmer said this week, is the affirmation of this idea. 
People pay every time less attention the operating system, the Web-Browser. 
The computer will only launched so that Firefox, the Explorer or hexavalent execute and every day we spend more time on surfing, as in the vicinity of 'window'. 
What serves half in computer of existing applications? 
Less is more 
And Windows 7 must more compact, more compact than Vista. 
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft's is more to integrate its online services, which could then become the alternative to Google.

It will not start, but at the end of 2009, more even 2010. 
Microsoft seeks the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on the same time. 
Every day transformed the telephone in a computer. 
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the delay will cost money.
