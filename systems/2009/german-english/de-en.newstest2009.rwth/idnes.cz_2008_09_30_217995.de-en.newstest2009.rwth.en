Duel on a knife edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. 
We advise you to your appointment 
While nearly every cell phone MP3-Dateien are unfolding, not MP3 players use. 
Why is, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Despite this, there are plenty of reasons why a stand-alone player should gain. 
The election depends on the type of use and the challenges of the future owner. 
Sure you buy it for home a splendid expensive Plattenspieler order the latest album from Boycko Turbulenc to listen to. 
Even seem such musical items not on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this. 
Have you LPs with type rock, jazz or blues shelf, dream you probably at least by one. 
It is also the music on trips, with condensed music, simple - music in MP3-Format. 
Here too there is price and quality categories. 
For the one hand, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player eight thousand kronor, as we will be a Pink-Floyd-Fan hard pressed headphones for twenty kroner market. 
Two extremes, between which everyone enough space. 
The selection is vast. 
Also the lifespan of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good music player can very much more than just music, but what can mobile phones, they do not even hints. 
No modern equipment is as universal as the telephone. 
Besides the primary functions, the cost and the Simsen, cannot be it music and videos, both, it has a better, or worse camera and can perhaps also. 
And if you add the Smartphons and communicators, it was almost a small computers in the bag. 
It is a minor miracle, because no fridge can grillen and no television taking photographs. 
But the universality of the mobile phones also disadvantages. 
The more responsibilities you on your cell phone use, the more often you will but it nachladen must. 
And that music is one of the largest energy. 
Only a few mobile phones can music longer than zehn-zwölf hours, most of it is much less. 
In this respect are Music player (especially the simplest) significantly more efficient. 
You should therefore cheap count mobile phones to expect that they will no longer than a few hours of music. 
If you then and still telephone, buy the safety prefer a Ladegerät scarred for office - which also applies to more expensive equipment. 
In MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of plant with a time loading. 
Another problem is, if it wants to ignore the music on mobile phones. 
Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment on a USB-Abschluss, also does not support any mobile phone without special software directly to a PC. 
Of course, cannot ignore the music directly to a storage medium means, but only a few Kartenlesegeräte will without reduction with the tiny Speicherkarten ready, which are used in mobile phones. 
In players need you to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need to feed the device only USB-Port with music from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and player conduct itself a Musikbibliothek to, according to the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the Genre or the assessment by users. 
Some devices are the only Baumstruktur of the Adressverzeichnisses onwards, similar Windows Explorer, some of them both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operating system). 
Players are easier to use mobile phones can more 
The selection of a specific piece of equipment you should the lifespan of batteries, the storage capacity, ask the quality, and the type of Klangs and of course the Bedienkomfort inquire. 
For music above all, and you hear it every day only briefly in the trams, then any mobile phone, is the MP3-Dateien. 
What can really almost every cell phone. 
They must not check, what Musikformate a mobile phone or a player can deal with. 
MP3 create all, and most of the music, which you receive, will be in this format. 
The format is one of the most widely disseminated, and also the most equipment also music in WMA-Format taking place. 
Less is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use). 
Better mobile phones allow online also buy music. 
One need only on mobile Internet the pages of a Providers (or any other provider), and it can be a song or album. 
This service can already in and of itself clincher, be it a Musikhandy should gain. 
Unfortunately this is offering the service providers and confined mostly only on quick Radiohits. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
In general, but the assumption is that this is exactly the sort of music (on GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) will dominate in the music industry. 
The mobile phone, the most itself. 
If you want to listen to something, you after the mobile phone in the expected, while the player forget is at home. 
However, it is important to whether your headphones or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung carry. 
If not, can you use the integrated loudspeakers, on the almost every mobile phone, but only the MP3 player. 
Perhaps the biggest benefit of the Musikhandys will for many on price. 
The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand kronor. 
For three and four thousand kroner get you a decent Walkmans. 
The biggest handicap will be for the majority that are not normal headphones. 
The best and technically ausgereiftesten telephones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphone cost up to fifteen thousand kronor. 
The advantage of the player is in the restaurant. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (selection) - player can each. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the restaurant with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or the Plattenspieler is obvious. 
There is no collision in the form of a mistakenly salaried mobile Internet and then exorbitant bill for data transfers. 
The device should now take 
Also the cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) usually have a Slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.). 
Even if nachkaufen you a karte nachkaufen, rich two thousand kroner. 
But beware. 
In the Basismodellen be supported in the rule only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive can read 8-GB-Speicherkarten read. 
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 players, you then attack after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you will have not more than 1100 kroner on the table. 
You are among the more demanding transmitted, you prefer to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and the Bedienkomfort comes as to the one MP3-Players regurgitating them. 
Most is Sony Ericsson, the mobile phones from the series Walkmans the same Nutzerschnittstelle have such as the one sold MP3 player. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with increased storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long Akku-Lebensdauer (usually 15 hours, maximum of up to 35 hours) make you MP3 players of these manufacturers.
