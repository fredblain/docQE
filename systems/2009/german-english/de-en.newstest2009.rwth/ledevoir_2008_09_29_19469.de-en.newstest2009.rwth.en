Conversation - From blood that safe again was 
Hema-quebec fêted yesterday the 10th anniversary of its founding and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. 
And, above all, it has the confidence of the public reclaimed by the scandal by contaminated blood in the 1980's and 1990's shaken. 
As we know, were contaminated by the Blutspendendienst of the Canadian Red Cross managed national Blutreserven during the 1980's with HIV and hepatitis C virus. 
Given this tragedy and public discontent led the Canadian Government in February 1994 a public, the judge Horace Krever Khare investigation, which aimed to bring light into the circumstances which led to this tragedy, and, in order to prevent another disaster of this nature. 
While reluctant judges Krever still hesitated, his report, then several provinces a committee on its feet, whose goal it was a new system for managing blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, met the committee Gélineau that referral. 
After the reports of Gélineau and Krever were founded in Canada two blood banks created: Hema-Quebec, which for Quebec is responsible, and the Canadian Blutgesellschaft, the other provinces and the two territories. 
'1998, as has Hema-Quebec their work, had hardly had 38% of people confidence in the Blutkonservensystem in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. 
The situation was disappointing. 
Through the enormous efforts to ensure the safety of the blood to improve and work in this area over the following years, we have the confidence of the public regained ", she says, before they are proud that early 2008 now almost 94% of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema-Quebec had. 
Dr Décary but retains, knowing that 'trust is something extremely fragile'. 
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 is Hema-Quebec following the principle of caution. 
At this time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new kind of CJD, told this woman, who has since its inception in 1998. 
And we had no idea whether there could be transferred this disease by blood. 
So we invoked one of the Hauptrichtlinien of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to one Ausschlussmaßnahmen applies Ausschlussmaßnahmen, if it does not know and when a disease only slowly, as it appears in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. 
So, in April 1999 no blood of people who had immigrated since 1980 longer than a month in the United Kingdom. 
Now, a few years ago, has been without doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
So has shown us the event that the principle of caution that we could well meaning. 
In 1999 he appeared on the market a lot more technology to detect HIV: the Nukleinsäure-Tests (NST), which directly in the blood of the donor the existence of the virus itself, and not the antibodies against the virus, as it did in the hitherto tests. 
The NST allowed it to shorten the incubation period, between the time the has been infected person and, if it can be found to be the first viruses through our techniques in the blood, the specialist. 
This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. 
So was the risk that it could be infected some donors, without knowing it, could not see and this, considerably reduced. 
These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion, to reduce. 
Today is one of 12 million people in danger, with HIV infected blood. 
"In other words, that means that 12 million blood distribute, before would be infected with HIV. 
Since distributed Hema-Quebec every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood, it would take more than 24 years, before a case, was the HIV on a Blutkonserve transferred. 
I believe that we now feel can, if a blood transfusion gets or the health to restore ', the head of Hema-Quebec. 
"Our challenge for the next ten years, it is the safety of our products. 
One never knows what pathogens into the system. 
Only last year is in Reunion, the Chikungunya-Virus appeared, which, as the Westnil-Virus, is spread by insects on the blood. 
We must constantly monitor ', Dr Décary continuing before they emphasised that must Hema-Quebec alongside a safe supply a sufficient supply available. 
'The growing demand, because the population is getting older. 
There are the treatments for cancer aggressively, need patients often new red blood cells or platelets. 
The aging of the population is also affecting the Blutspendernetz from, where on average only 3% of the donations appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. ' 
Can any healthy people, the 18 years or older is and meets the eligibility criteria, all 56 days, six times a year, give blood. 
On average 14% of the people, their blood available to, not because they are sick of AIDS or malaria, visited and who, in a country that is prevalent in the malaria, will be excluded for one year by blood donations. 
"With these 3% to keep an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals. 
Lack of stockpiles are very rare. 
But we must change the members of this Spendernetzes renew as they grow older and can give blood. 
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and to encourage them to be regular donors. 
Life is now so hectic that rarely take the time to spend an hour in donations', regrets Mrs Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars is not Hema-Quebec only blood, but also human tissues, including Knochentransplantate, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, which is used almost exclusively for serious fire violations. 
These tissues are being analysed, processed and frozen before they Hema-Quebec be stored, which administers the only public Nabelschnurblutbank of Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord, which had been regarded as biomedical waste, stem cell rich blood, which can help, serious diseases such as leukaemia, to deal with. 
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the stockpiling our thousandth Nabelschnurblutprobe, and we plan every year more than buy a thousand lessen. 
'We should probably early next year begin, for transplants to provide ", explained Dr Décary further, this programme of Nabelschnurblut- abnahme describes as very popular. 
"Many mothers are convinced no such access to have ', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals of Quebec.
