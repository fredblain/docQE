Questions after the accident: are stewards in the bus is illegal? 
The law does not know it, in a Fernreisebus is not the Umherlaufen 
In connection with the tragic accident involving a bus of society student Agency in the vicinity of the Italian Padua begs the question is whether stewards and passengers during the journey in the bus and running away. 
"We wanted strictly and formally the law, the work of a stewards in defiance of the law on road transport," the spokesman for the Department of Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, in the last week a giving Stewardess died, caused probably by the drivers of the vehicles, the kreuzte the bus the path kreuzte. 
The young woman was in this moment to top it all, in addition to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, even if they have two more seats available. 
A bus can also have an accident or sharply curbed, in which the Steward coffee or newspapers austrägt. 
Played a role, too, whether the bus the Fahrzeugbrief viewed with Stehplätzen facility. 
If it is not in a bus, must sit the travellers. 
The Fernreisebusse of student Agency have no Stehplätze; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz confirmed. 
"This we have with the Treasury, and it has not agreed to let the movement of passengers. 
Later withdrew it, and we came to a consensus that the passengers during the journey to the toilet can, if they have their seat ", he told his position with. 
The law makes no Steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a stewards - no law describes this role. 
But there are also no law, which prohibits the carriers to provide services. 
The law on the road only the concept Fahrzeugbegleiter; rights and obligations defined it ", the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka clearly. 
The director of the department vehicles Department of Transportation Josef Pokorný other hand, believes that the law this problem. 
"It is a question of whether the bus in the product approval also Stehplätze has. 
This is everything, "he says. 
Buses are divided between buses, where it Stehplätze gives and the speed limit is limited local with Stehplätzen and higher level of speed and Fernreisebusse without Stehplätze with the highest permitted speed and seats, which are equipped with seat belts. 
As the plane, says the professional 
The BESIP-Fachmann for road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees in the movement of stewards on board a bus not essential. 
"In a liquid driving will threaten not many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board an aircraft. 
Here, too, is not sure when turbulence, and the Stewardess can chafe. " 
"Slow but a bus sharp, then naturally apply the laws of physics. 
As in Stadtbus or in a tram. 
The safety of the stewards must clarify the carrier through internal rules, "he says, and also says that will not solve this issue from the perspective of the law. 
Jančura is prepared to remove the services 
Student Agency is the only Busfirma services of stewards. 
The company employs around 200 people in office. 
The director is their even after the accident, not as risikoträchtig. 
"As soon as I get the impression that the job of stewards risikoträchtig is it, I will remove him. 
Coffee and newspapers can passengers in boarding. 
This would also reduce costs, "he says. 
As interest in the safety of the director of Asiana Alexy Litvin the absence of stewards in his buses. Its society is but only a fraction of lines compared with student Agency. 
"We have no stewardesses, defend us from birth. 
Sooner or later the journalists with a fatal accident, "he had not quite a year ago for Týden.cz expressed. 
That was an enormous tragedy 
The accident involving a Linienbusses after Naples was a young Stewardess from the region Pilsen, who had worked for two years for the society. 
The Slovenian lorries was abgebogen probably without lights the pull abgebogen and had the bus journey. 
The attempted drivers of the bus, with a close manoeuvres to avoid, collided with the right could move with the lorry. 
That had been sold two seats for the stewards, denies Jančura. 
"These places can be reserved not great, they are blocked." 
Firm wants to sue lorry drivers. 
With compensation for the family of the young woman the agency will not wait for the court, a financial compensation expected them but also of the culprits. 
A change? 
Not in sight. 
A more detailed regulations of the movement of stewards on board a bus could have legislation, which an investment activities experts team of the Department of Transportation already over a year. 
This, however, is not yet practical. 
Buses are also on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones in the journey, "expert Hořín. 
"The Department of Transport the work of the stewards not as something that the safety of the traveling public much could threaten," Hanzelka, with control over the security of the buses in the hands of the police and the Arbeitsschutzbehörden lies.
