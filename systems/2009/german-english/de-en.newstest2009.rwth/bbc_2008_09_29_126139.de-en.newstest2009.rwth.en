BSkyB loses appeal in the case ITV 
BSkyB has his appeal against the decision by the Competition Commission, its share of the competing station ITV to reduce, lost. 
The Wettbewerbsberufungsgericht has BSkyB to reduce its involvement in ITV of 17.9% to below 7.5%. 
Previously, the Commission said that the proportion BskyBs relation the competition and allows him unfair influence on the station ITV. 
BSkyB has its fair share in 2006, by NTL, now in Virgin Media renamed, on the purchase of ITV prevented. 
In April 2007 reported the competition authority that the purchase of the stake in ITV by BSkyB was that there were doubts about the independence of the ITV, what has been the Competition Commission to launch an investigation. 
The Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office Ofcom have opposed the purchase. 
BSkyB, said the pressure its share of ITV to reduce, is an unreasonable and excessive measure, particularly because BSkyB announced its voting rights to want.
