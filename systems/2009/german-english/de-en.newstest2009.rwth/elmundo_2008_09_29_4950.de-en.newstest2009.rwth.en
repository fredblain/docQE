For the Olympic Games are the roads in Madrid flawed. 
Yes, the dream of many of us, some Olympic sports in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, as it can perhaps be 2016. 
But I wonder: Are we ready for this? ' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say, that it is not true! 
It was described as a perfect street, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with punches and off, there was. 
Of course, that is a lot of rubbish, would be the assessment of attention and I might review, so clearly were not accepted. 
But, we start by everything. 
The nonsense begins with the Ticketholen to that allows you to go, as the first. 
It seems to me to be a bad thing, but if they can do for you, then they give you everything (including chip, in order to avoid the congestion on the road). 
What does not. 
There they you only ticket get (the first nonsense, which is the only reason to go) and (after an endless queue) is the surprise, the satirical there were only in the size of 'S' (a second nonsense, because I the size XL need) 
Where we live? 
Or is it that the crisis was resolved only small, much cheaper shirts from less substance to buy? 
Well, things like this are a small in comparison to the days on the road. 
Apart from the fact that must go very early to go to the chip, which is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, must leave the schoolbag. 
The wait has more than 35 minutes, which in the case of a street, where we expect 11,000 people, is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as it was to be expected, the streets and we had our Rücksäcke not, even if it once was, but they use would be more difficult. 
Also, it was, in those 40 minutes waiting for rain, so that it came to the temptation to organise a popular uprising and throwing it to invade. 
I believe this morning will certainly some 500 people pneumonia and some as I be because this chip, which I received, not even in time of classification, I am quite sure that the wrong branded. 
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect street ask, it would never occur. 
I believe that we will still have a long way from a dream, which for the Olympic Games well prepared is
