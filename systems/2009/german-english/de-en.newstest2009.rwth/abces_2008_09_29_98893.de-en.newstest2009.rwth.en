"Sangre de mayo ': Heldenbuch of Garci 
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós, is José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous uprising of Spaniards against the French, which is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with about 15 million investment for the Dreharbeiten. 
In this way has tried the Cineast tried a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he had always admired to the sites of the famous novel writer admired, said today Carci in the presentation of the cinema with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers. 
"Sangre de mayo 'with a Filmlänge of more than two-and-a-half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later at the station Telemadrid than a four-hour Miniserie shown. 
José Luis Garci, a big fan of the literature of Galdós, assured us that this Dreharbeit his' Kindheitstraum 'came true, he can thank Esperanza Aguirre, who gave three years ago by the autonomous community in Madrid, to a Gedenkfilm to second Jahrhundertsfeier on 2 November in Madrid, particularly because the story on the basis of' Episodios Nacionales' is based, the mission. 
The total of 15 million, which was contested by the autonomous community in Madrid for Dreharbeiten, offers Garci, as he ever has, the unique opportunity 'with polite and clothing that image of the "distraught Spain, which aussuchte the wrong leader for the fight, because the people in the fight for the independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII in arrears had been present. 
But regrets the Cineast, if the funding as' Alatriste 'or' Los fantasmas de Goya (twice as high as in 'Sangre de mayo') have not been able to count, why were some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with the Garci almost his whole career working, not made. 
For this reason, has Garci, who also Filmdirektor in 'Volver Wyatt empezar' was, by his own operation involved: he went to the scene to the actors, with whom we first rehearsed must before you start to swing and for those who do not Casting felt had seemed he 'humiliating' and respect verschaffend, 'part of the profession of the Filmdirektors consists, aid in theatre and cinema, in order to know what is in the cinema industry, in which they work, is happening.' 
Many performers, he in 'Sangre de mayo' faces, must reiterate his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos ’ or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar-Kandidat in four nominations (of which he has won a), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates, who this year Spain before the Academy of Hollywood, represents a new generation of Spanish Filmographie represents. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', "Siete mesas de billar francés' and not the film Los girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film expected Garci no awards. 
"In the beginning I bet you that you arbeitest for the descendants arbeitest, later merkst you discover that it is only for continued health is, and you are now satisfied, while a film has produced," said Garci after more than 30 years of work.
