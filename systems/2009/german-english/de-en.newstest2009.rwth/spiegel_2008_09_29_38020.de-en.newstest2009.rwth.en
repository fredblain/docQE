Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a Schabe is fleeing in danger, that means that they fear felt? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: much animals have feelings. 
Only as we could see whether they feel the same way, if they do as we do? 
In the Internetzeitschrift "Edge" has been going on for several years contributions certain famous scientists published. 
Mirror ONLINE presented in a series of specific answers to the question "What do you think true, without having to prove it?" 
I believe that animals feelings and other Bewusstseinszustände have without that I or anyone else, that is where we are not even able to prove that other people. 
But in this case must we hope, at least since all human brains same Grundkonfiguration landmark. 
When we checked other species and the questions of sensitivity or general awareness of touch, we impassable terrain, because the hardware disagree. 
If a rat is at risk, it is the same as many other animals: she is dead, retreats or addresses. 
People behave similarly, which some scientists on a comparable subjective experience. 
This, however, I do not believe. 
Two aspects of the Gehirnstruktur make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the animals. 
One close the almost always with human consciousness associated some lateral prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the speech, and the Ausführungs- / management functions). 
This broad region is developed in humans is much higher than in the other primates and seems to be in other creatures. 
At least those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge who we are, and to the ability to decide, there is reason to believe that differs, Man from the other primates. 
Another dramatic character is in the nature of the human: that is such a large part of its Erlebens with language, it is often said, that was it. 
In this case could exclude animals. 
But even if conscience of language would be, this would certainly affect, animal awareness, as well as it may be, probably very of most of our Bewusstseins-zustände unterschiede. 
It is hard to identify, as awareness among other animals may be. 
If, as something that meeting and odour, neither measure yet, because of the specific hardware, from our own experience analyse, presents his research into major problems. 
Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of awareness, which will be scientifically more easily accessible. 
We could study the Bewusstseinsprozesse of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the like of primates, especially in the visualize,. 
But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick incidents, more likely to be on the neural Korrelate of consciousness than for the casual mechanisms: both may be identical or not. 
Interestingly, stressed this approach the importance of the prefrontal cortex to the visualize,. 
What is for the sentiments? 
I put them back that activated an emotional system such as the fear in his own activity deliberate brain activated. 
What we call a "fear", is the mental condition in which we find ourselves if the activity of the brain lokalisierten defence system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) Arbeitsspeicher self-justifying. 
So are tied sentiments closely with the regions of the cortex, the primates, and especially the people. 
Combined with the linguistic nature are subtle gradations of it, because we cannot distinguish and categorize the words and grammar, at only among ourselves. 
This means, for example, Antonio Damasio, that feelings from pre activities in the Körpergefühlsregionen of the cortex and the Hirnstammes emerge similar Jaak Pankseep, but more to the Hirnstamm concentrated. 
As this network over the course of human evolution not very changed, there could well gattungsübergreifenden sentiments. 
Theory I cannot disagree, but I think it unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues, which in rats and humans as fear, is also probably in two cases: how but you can check whether over-the-top rats and people the same, if they behave in the same way? 
A Schabe is fleeing in danger if they fear felt? 
In my eyes can prove very Verhaltensähnlichkeit still no experience of equality. 
Although helps the neural comparison: rats and people have similar Hirnstämme, not Schaben against it a brain. 
But is the Hirnstamm for feelings? 
And even if the people fear: How wanted it in rats show? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), have feelings. 
But I would not know, as I meant. 
And because their feelings presumably significantly differ from our (since human consciousness on specific Schaltkreisen and language is based), erforsche I prefer the emotional behaviour as the emotional feelings of rats. 
At least offer progress here on the neural level, unless you measure in rats and people the same. 
As I erforsche language and awareness in rats, not including feelings, I do not know whether they exist. 
This may mean, but I prefer, than to constantly against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist.
