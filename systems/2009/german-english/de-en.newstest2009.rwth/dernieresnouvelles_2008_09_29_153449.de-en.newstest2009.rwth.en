Illhäusern... finally 
After a long drought is Illhäusern on the pitch finally forging ahead. 
Without much effort erspielten itself the Gelb-Schwarzen numerous Torchancen and abandoned it, one of them, and so to win the game. 
The speed of that meeting, in which the attacker trouble, their skills to show, was not very high. 
After a first attack of the Gastkapitäns Kauffmann, whose Fernschuss scarce on the corner of escaping, should Illhäusern with ease the game dominate, and it was alternately only Fonderflick with a Fernschuss, then brain with a Hochpass, and Romain with a shot with the Fußspitze, the defensive Denmark. 
The rival team blockte in the Feldmitte and left only the lively Riahi at the apex of the storm. 
The start of the second half should be crucial with two by Riahi and Temporale hard-fought Torchancen, and immediately afterwards, with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, the was, to adopt a ball that was eliminated in the initial attempt by Diebold repelled. 
But the illhäusische Torschütze should enjoy not his luck long and be sent around 12 minutes later to the bank, which lost had to keep his team Kameraden numerically inferior continue. 
Denmark but did not play and has a illhaeusischen Elf no major problems, only a little bit, to their defence to 'only', except in the last seconds of the game, in which escaping the ball after a mess very close to the bar escaping.
