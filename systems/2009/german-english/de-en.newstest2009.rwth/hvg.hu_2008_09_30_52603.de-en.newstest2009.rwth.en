You are, what you on your way mitteilst 
At its tenth birthday can Google with fair to say that it is in the pockets of the people as to find above their heads in the sky: you know, where the people their holidays, which are specialists they go and what they are. 
And that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, the chief executive officer of Google. 
In the sceptics who of Orwellian nightmare visions be plagued, he hosts: these were just the essence of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google, more personal data about users to collect and so the original purpose of the company to get closer to that "all information this world class". 
Schmidt said Google was after ten years weltverändernder work still only at the beginning of the Informations-Sammelns. 
The status quo in five years, "said Schmidt: he wanted, Google would be able to questions like" What can I do tomorrow? "Or" what job fits really to me? "To answer, however, are software programs not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. 
Not all Internet-User are aware that were registered in Internet-Recherchen the Suchbegriffe, and also the IP addresses, from which sought, and the visiting sides. 
For example, the two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" allows us to store the visitors his own Suchverlauf and drawing later, that can bring the hit later much more precise and, on the same logic are the so-called "Recommendations," with whom the system tailor-made recommends products and services because of the previous preferences. 
The users wondering what in the event of a Datenmissbrauchs happens - "If you check what I do" - show some concerned whether the Google-Datenmonopols. 
In most cases it is more of the firm, potential power, frightening, and less feeling guilty or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power, with many Internet-Usern of rejection. 
However, it is a proven fact that stored the Suchbegriffe not only, but instead will be passed on occasion even to third parties, and in these Gesetzesfällen there is no protection for the rights of the Internet-Users. 
A perfect example was recently against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google the Brazilian government information by the Gemeinschaftssite called "Orkut" were collected and did also identify the Pädophilien possible. 
Personal rights was users could breathe a sigh of relief, but in May, as Google together with the Bürgerrechts organisation EFF successfully against the FBI in court: so can be forced Google in future with any of the Constitution, information the FBI secret question. 
(However, the federal government successfully the 50,000 Webadressen and 1,000 Suchbegriffen with reference to the years ago adopted Jugendschutzgesetz hydrocarbon, but it was the list of individual users, denied or whose Web- and research on list to two months backdated.) 
Googles image remains controversial: those who hand over their personal data reluctantly, because they fear by the use of the Google-Dienste the loss of their private and make-up, chastising the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. 
But the American "Geek-Kultur", which, in many countries is present and enthusiastic Computerfans, unites activists and users, the next generation of the "coolen entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which thanks to Windows market leader, even if fighting both at the same goal. 
One possible reason is that Google its users, in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and his services are available for free, and that a more open, constantly updated source code and Programm-Package far more attractive, young and cool seem to be, as the official practices of the computer software. 
On the other hand, says the Geeks the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet caustic - a relationship, especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" is at the core. 
The "Web 2.0" is nothing more than collaboration, in other words, the users left deliberately traces and use the available channels of communication and, even if the individual are different, remains the main thing, the same publicly to show. 
An ordinary person can simultaneously in several Gemeinschaftsportalen be high profile management - from Facebook on Xanga, can these other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm with each other, and can include all this in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they could lead to blogs, which are the latest Fotogalerien automatically, which are geostet on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a number of other classic cases shows: that if the Partyfotos to last night's the girlfriend soon, with whom it disloyal friend Bush-bashing has, or will be, because he makes in his blog too honest his anger at the corporate governance air - one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been completely new. 
If you have a Online-Leben, is what he reveal - or less can be given in the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth. 
And anyone who tried to keep something secret, or even the Google-Monopol to circumvent, can gladly do that - as with Scroogle, a Tool, the grab at the search engine Google grab, but deliberately no trace. 
Many people register not deliberately on Gemeinschaftsseiten, so that they are not accessible, but also the Online-Applikationen of Google, such as Textverarbeitungs- and graphics tools and RSS-Feeds, with alternative versions, which are tied to huge Serverparks and generate not the best profile by users. 
Public opinion has yet been averted, until Google her up. 
With its current value of $156 billion the company even before IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the Werbeflächen of AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenue advertisers, and the faster imported services are not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical observer will find the disturbing polarities, has rejected the directors a protest by the staff, having doubled the price of the company ’ s nursery have been doubled, also said the management, the frequent meals of staff is too expensive, which is as mild against the fact that Google in 2006, the Chinese government even in the knees and was with an agreement agreed that all dissident hits, or those who breach the good taste, filtered out. 
The internal rules of the group that will be advertised in advance no new service, but only if it is already available, but could the events of the months and years ahead again some sharply change: while some think, Google's Buch- and Magazinscan- or archiving project have now, that the company soon with the Supreme Court to address, are different because of the "" health "concerned that the calls for a complete Gesundheitsprofils basis of findings, doctors and problems. 
And the fact that Google a genetic database builds, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors the substance, as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian fashion a future in which a man thanks to Google's data chillingly nahbar will.
