Dark matter on flight from Raumsonden 
For years a mystery for has been scrapped for confusion: Dark Matter influenced the speed of Raumsonden during so-called Swing-by-Manöver. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein's not quite right. 
Almost 18 years flew the spacecraft "Ulysses" through the space. 
Because as soon gefrierenden Treibstoffleitungen threatening them now the cold. 
Among scientists for years a mystery phenomenon for confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie. 
The Swing-by is a manoeuvres by Raumsonden, during which they additional momentum in gravitating to a Himmelskörpers, around the world. 
This can save the probes much fuel savings. 
The Euro-American Forschungssonde Cassini-Huygens used these physical trick as well as the Sonnensonde Ulysses. 
What surprised the researchers, however, have been for years: the missiles not behave perfectly as one would expect after the ancient Gravitationsgesetz. 
Rather it is to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes are unexpectedly speed up or slow down. 
So far, could not explain the physicists that effect. 
They cleared and it Swing-by-Anomalie. 
Some fear experts, possibly even the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein, who described the attraction of matter by a curvature of the area, may be not quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton believes determined that Einstein not erred, and the Swing-by-Anomalie EES to explain to the so-called dark matter, the astronomers in the universe. 
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which is also in the vicinity of the Earth are could," he says. 
Of the existence of dark matter know the Weltraumforscher only had ten years ago. 
It is clearly an attraction, whose effect on other Himmelskörper itself. 
She herself is totally invisible, which means that it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially is also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists is the Dark Matter got as good a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
