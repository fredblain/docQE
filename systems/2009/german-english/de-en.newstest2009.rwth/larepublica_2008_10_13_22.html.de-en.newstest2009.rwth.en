If the energy from waves, are suddenly the Great at 
It is not a non-exhaustive money source, which covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seem to understand that the large energy companies in the world. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources to the now all, and also to occupy, as giants like Chevron. 
The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea to win, we have for 70 years into consideration and investigated; not accidentally stepping up these studies since the first oil crisis. 
As the price of oil by 1980 caved vergas the idea of marine energy, but now pressing environmental organisations and the increase in oil prices to new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated that 15% of the Global Call energy needs from the Ozeanwellen produced energy could be covered. 
That would mean that figure the by nuclear plants produce energy. 
Be added the currents and tides. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first firm, which is now on the marine energy, is Enersis, signed in 2005 a contract for the construction of a power station in northern Portugal. 
As the news was published seemed a revolutionary step to act. 
Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy sector who rely on marine energy. 
"Chevron analyzed these technologies", the spokesman of one of the giants of well-known company in The Wall Street Journal - and bets the possibility of working with us. " 
It is to obtain a licence by the American Energiekommission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is not to be underestimated as a sign, particularly when you consider that in Alaska still oil through the United States and President Bush recently the plans for new drilling. 
In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant Power genome map generated from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, in the new industry invest; are the details not known, observers by a rising interest. 
Still items technologies. 
Experts speak of a still on its technology, not least, because there have not been clarified nor the recent doubts from environmentalists. 
So far are projects such as Portugal and also Scotland rather minor dimension and seem to be no serious environmental problems. 
In order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power as using a system of interlinked put observation buoys. 
The burst of the waves, which the buoys and knelt down, within the swimmer on Kolben and magically appear in hydraulic pressure. 
This is a Turbine, see what is a generator. 
The electricity will be sent out on Unterwasserleitungen to coast. 
Until now, there are four planned facility of this kind, which only added to the government approval. One part of the energy could also for military installations. 
Verdant Power produces but already energy for a Warenkaufhaus and a Parklatz EES unterseeischer turbines in the East River from New York. 
The Wasserbewegungen during the tides drives the turbines, which is fuelled by the emerging Drehbewegung the generator. 
According Verdant has been waiting for to use a long queue of potential clients on the necessary authorisations for these sources. 
The waves, then the tides. 
A special interest earned according to the Institute for Stromgewinnungsforschung stage just the potential, in the tides. 
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, are the tides but better predict as Windstr√∂mungen, the sun and the waves and, therefore, a more reliable source of power. 
The tidal energy is what states like New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states, already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 to invest - for 2009 are already planned up to 35 million.
