'I want to be a young mother; the candidate I am not worried' 
Their strong performance with her sister, did not prevent them, to develop their own personality. 
Mónica Cruz is in front, but full of life. 
Currently the siblings Gruz their new work in the fashion very seriously. 
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty rich and Mädels, who maintain their reputation. 
She was in Paris when the company Mango, moved then resident and makes the presentation of the main prizes in the fashion, the sponsor of the Spanish Modehaus sponsors. 
Mercifully and timid, winner for the short distances. 
Erzähl us, what you are doing in Paris. 
I came here the new range for this autumn / winter season, the sister Penélope and I have devised for Mango, to present, I have the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' visited and the dinner to Valentinos honors. 
A very thorough working time, which is exciting. 
They work for the Spanish House, what is the basis of your new range for the fourth season Mango? 
My sister, I too are the films of the 1950s and 1960s years fascinated; there, we find many ideas. 
Gladly, I through a town and see women as they are held, as they have their clothes combine, which I often. 
Dancers, actress and Modedesignerin, you are a very different women, do you? 
Yes, I believe, but finally, everything out in and these areas have much in common. 
Since I was young, was I of the clothes enthusiastic; I always wanted to go to my grandmother, in the Kleidungsschränken my aunt herumzuwühlen and to see their clothes. 
This was super, almost better than going to a recreational park. 
Already later, as dancers, I tried to the clothing. 
You know, we dancers like it so much, our own style in teaching and to have with the samples, to look into the mirror and feel good. 
As an actress if you get the matches, put it in the real Darstellerrolle. 
Finally, coupled with everything else, it is much respect for the Kostümdesigner and professionalism. 
Recently, you are 30, you are in no crisis? 
Ah what. 
I feel better than ever, as 30 year I feel good. 
I think the woman is ripe, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer errors. 
I am not afraid for my biological clock. 
I have the projects, which I have since I was young, wanted to make and this has given me much to enjoy. 
So, heard you point to become mothers, or not? 
For a long time, I know that I am going to mother because my body and also I want a young mother; that I miss. 
What the candidate, because I am not worried. 
I will, my baby great Glücksgefühle mediate and it with much love. 
As for the film, behältst du in the eyes of the work, in which you have attended and were made last year. 
As it is and I would like very much that they will be presented to the public. 
I, as a woman who comes from theatre, am very impatient and restless, and to have everything at once, which cannot be immediately. 
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' list for the first time. 
Time, as you like 
A couple days, you are published on the Laufstieg with Naomi Campbell, is it? 
It is all well and good, say not so what. 
It is not that I do on the Laufstieg, to modeln. 
Naomi Campbell, which I have known for some time, I was simply called and London invited to London, in a parade for the Wohltätigkeitveranstaltung their organisation 'women for a better world' and the clothing that we show, and I know that were auctioned off two garments from our range for Mango, in order to raise the money for Naomis NGOs. 
People do not know Naomis good heart. 
There are many things about it. I, than the one they know, would you say that they do not. 
Nevertheless, I will support this good idea, it is involved. 
She asked me to take part in the parade for these warm-hearted thing, but if it does happen and refuse to make a Handstand, I will do that too. 
In order to support women in the developing world, which is also necessary.
