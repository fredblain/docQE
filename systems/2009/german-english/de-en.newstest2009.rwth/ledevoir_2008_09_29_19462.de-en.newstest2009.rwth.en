Free - the Orwellian speech by Barrick gold 
In its edition on 17 September, Le Devoir a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vize-Generaldirektor the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and followed a nineteen logic, that the greatest Goldgewinnung society in the world a libel case over six million against three authors and a small mittelloses publishing house was, with the goal being a 'public transparent plastic debate' to open. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then do not judge them on the truth, especially in the case of libel lawsuits, but above the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was concealed by Mr Garver completely. 
For Barrick gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, in the ruin, who dares, one of the its opposite views. 
No matter how the process, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers, who are paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
The tactics in these unequal struggle is often to ruin the defender, to enforce an amicable settlement, which the other side, silence and is also anyone who dares to look again at the question. 
If wanted Barrick gold really a public debate, they would have their attitudes from public opinion must present. 
In contrast, as in many of the countries in which works Barrick gold, and is, to be played in Canada debates normally through the exchange of ideas and not by Knüppelhiebe. 
It would have sufficed, if the gold mine its books and files and have opened a real debate, through the papers, media, publishing and financing independent Prüfteams, the light on this issue could have. 
But Barrick gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and embraced the petitions and letters of support for the authors by Noir between Canada with a snap. 
Perhaps Mr Garver explain, as he simultaneously a 'public' debate may ask and opinions that public scorn? 
Apparently includes this word in the world of only the generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very nice beengte vision of the term. 
In a democracy to speak even detractors the right. 
What Barrick gold does not understand - or not understand - is that the general public, which the authors and publishers of Noir between Canada, above all, it is, of course, because they are the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
Public opinion is willing to listen Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in a framework, which many saw as Knebel-Klage (during the 'public debate "has Barrick gold just a request to the authors of Noir between Canada, in which she asked of them, to not use that word more...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the case brought by Barrick gold a direct assault on the freedom to academic research and seek out the truth, which are essential to any democratic society. 
They denied the right, credible sources to quote and about facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work. 
If it a country such as Canada is impossible, subjects to research and discuss the rich companies of this world, who else can this do? 
If wanted Barrick gold really a public and open debate, could bring them in line with the scientific standards, which were used by the authors of Noir between Canada. 
She has a right to reply. 
The university environment to which we belong has long debates and inconsistencies in the and to resolve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that, contrary to what they claim, in no mood to a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time that the governments of measures which restrict this sort of undeserved complaints.
