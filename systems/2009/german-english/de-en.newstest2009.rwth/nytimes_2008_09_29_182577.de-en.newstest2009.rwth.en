The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, a city of special kind 
Tucked away between the excesses of recreational parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, noisy and huge type, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of Afro-amerikanischen culture. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the city Zora Neale Hurstons, is not as simple as Hurston it in 1935 did, "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown hide, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Nowadays it is a Pilgerstätte. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Did intend festival in Eatonville come of the most famous author the Harlem Renaissance. 
And yet is and remains the city, the describes - and it made to a Touristenausflugsziel, calling them in the Florida tour guide, which was produced for periods of depression by Bundesschriftstellerprojekts produced - in many ways the very particular kind. 
Eatonville is so independent, overall and privately how in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused their true thoughts with the weissen Mann to share, "so little about the rest of us know that he does not know what he escapes." 
Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, called on open conversation about Rassenverhältnisse, there are so many here, watched by Aussenseitern to be. 
"We are very anxious as our history being told," Hortense Jones, 59, from birth, a resident of the city and Gemeindemitglied the oldest church in the city. 
It must be true. " 
Eatonville was defined for a long regarded as paradox of triumph and the fight. 
It is a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly allowed inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average. 
It is a stronghold of literature and an example of change - sometimes sentenced, sometimes touted - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that people here both proud and wary. 
And so began the concerns about Eatonville '’ s image with Zora, as all Hurston mention. 
It was the world their hometown in books, in the of my heart and written in written, as "Mules Advice and Men" (1953) and "old eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Floridareiseführer modified the city, the very close to the route 77, leads a road through the oft-vergessene centre of Florida, to the scene of black history and human drama. 
Insolent as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston reader to the shop by Eatonvilles inaugural mayor, Joe Clarke, and was then privateren Affairs. 
"Margins of the road on the left," she wrote, "the brown -weiss angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and Spielplätzen for always Howard Miller, even though he cannot read and write." 
They also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks all sold and was-auch-immer to Stundenzimmern fits." 
In only a few hundred words brought Hurston therefore Eatonville with self-government in, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly no tour guide. 
In fact, this was not a Portrait, that all of you. 
"Zora described the things as they were," the 90-year old made Dinkins, one of the Johnson-Mädchen the Hurston offers, by the men,, quoted the songs on their beauty sang, the full sexual innuendo. 
They added: "The people disliked." 
We remember here still Hurtson than a lively Exzentrikerin, which returned regelmässig, after her family after Jacksonville, Florida was drawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if Hurston in the city gebraust came, they usually without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, rauchend and with trousers, in a city which today in its venerable clothing style straightforwardly. 
Mr Franklin were the most populous fascinated, whereas many of you despise. 
"Were always glad Zora to see," said Mr Franklin. 
But "it was never too long," he said he added during in his chair schaukelte, on a back home terrace, on the Sabelia sea, in which the Hurston all likelihood baptized was. 
As Hurston in 1960 died was avidly poor and their books. 
Together with the bulk of the world seemed to forget Eatonville they have. 
Although they once a famous author, was a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman sitting at Barnard College in the 1920ern, it was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. 
In Eatonville there were no ceremony, no public readings. 
"I do not think that they their contribution in the world or its heritage in the least understood," Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography on Hurston the was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city, the Kennedy Boulevard to replace, the slow two-lane main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs already had the motorway 4 through the western edge of town. 
The proposal was presented as Eatonville itself still of a difficult phase in its history, rebounded. 
Forced integration, among other things, gave the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing hatred in the community. 
"At this time was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and toys on the sidelines in front of people," said Mr Franklin. 
"There was even a woman who was killed. 
They threw a Wassermelone from the car. " 
In 1955 hinterfragte Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the Supreme Court, integration, giving them their decision in the case of Brown against the Schulrat as "insulting instead my race respektierend." 
Residents say today that although the lifting of racial segregation in some respects, was positive, it's the Gruppenzusammenhalt in Eatonville and self-assurance of its young people influence. 
"Black children were used to it, hugged to be - I remember - we embrace his teachers in the morning and you embrace your teacher at night," N. So-and-so Nathiri, daughter of made Dinkins and Managing Director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville Community. 
This could be as long, she added, by teachers and pupils no longer from the same place. 
"We embrace his white teachers, because he was a white teachers - I think there is a cultural gap exists," said Mrs Nathiri. 
But the civil rights that was created room for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who transcended itself on prejudices transcended, as they did, with positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How can refuse any joy my society deny! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, the novelist Alice Walker on the path to Hurstons nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of their glory. 
Five years later was a much praised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. Hemenway in the Bücherregalen to find, and made it back to part of the American Literaturkanons. 
The Fernstraßenprojekt just at a time, was published in the Eatonvilles most famous single daughter once again in the public eye. 
And this time saw Hurstons old neighbours as Retterin. 
The town began in 1988 with the construction of a Hurston festivals to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January put many for the celebration. 
A few years later wrote the district of his Straßenbauplänen. 
"The plans a fünfspurigen highway crowded the city, accelerated the whole thing with top speed, gave real Bürgerstolz," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd Wenzhong put it somewhat easier, "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the Fernstraßenprojekt has contributed to change the image of the city. 
There were more and more Zugereiste, just as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who is since 1993 in the Church, and residents began to appreciate the past. 
Eatonville in 1998 in the nationwide historic register. 
A new einstöckige library (named, of course, after Hurston) opened in 2006 at the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today is Eatonville remains for a feature in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can sometimes anfühlen as a Hintergasse in summer rain, as small as the time when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880ern. 
(It is now up to 90% black.) 
Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are often still treated with caution. 
For most of the interviews is an approval in advance and certain things - just as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest Church, by a Weissen painted and black men in the field of work - must not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a penchant for Dunkelrot, still fear that their secretive community misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time the Hurston-Festival larger, was also a greater degree of Heimatstolz born. 
Young people in particular tend Eatonville to see how Hurston their whole race saw: so beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and proud, creative, and hardworking, silly and mixed as any other racial and Völkergruppe in America. 
It is the sincere love for this town in the voice of Mr Franklin nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to after Eatonville to returning in the town council or to the police to work, which according to him a little aid could use. 
And even the relatively young, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter Park, have learned that Eatonville correctly. 
"Most people on the road, only here, will think, 'Well, this city is nothing compared to the other," said Alondra Kenon other day on Sunday after the church. 
"But if you stop and look at for a moment of its history, it is a very nice city."
