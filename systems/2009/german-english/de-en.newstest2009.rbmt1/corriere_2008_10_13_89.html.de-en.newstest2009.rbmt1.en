The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already revealed itself before some days, as the deputy-chamber against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket of the white house was correct: A deep slice of the Americans was and is interested at it more, that to punish Street embankment to rescue as the economy. 
This confirms the yesterday's edition the New York of Time, that tells about it, how the crisis in the trot divides the republican party, that forks more and more, into her/its/their old and moderate east Coast-Seele that always favored the state institutions and them/her/it business community and that neokonservative, that " faces those in Washington " and the finance-world adversely and wins V. A. in the south and the center of the states voters. 
This part of the party owes his/its ascent to V. A. of the voice his that I mentioned above. 
This example mentioned just is only a small part of the big changes, that the momentary economic earthquake announces or even already represents, meanwhile: not only in the USA, also in the entire west and maybe also over this will be concerned from these. 
As well as in the states also as in Europe seems the crisis to accelerate the events feared long, which finally assumes shape under these new conditions and comes at the light. 
The first of these phenomenons is the Neuentdeckung, the outrageous renaissance of the state in connection with a type Renationalisierung of the economy. 
Indeed the crisis means a decline of the bank - and finance-institutions which narrow connections possess to the foreign countries and administer an immense quantity of the fortunes of private house-holds, that lives in one single state, at the same time. 
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: namely like it itself opposite the concerned families too restrained which represent also a vast voter-mass is valid. 
The crisis appears therefore economically globally, politically against it she/it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems gotten at itself into the offside so to be and to have lost his/its speech-right: The plausible proof for this has been given by the EC, which knows to find no common way on the basis of her/its/their division into different national and international conflicts. 
Therefore, all now reckon with the intervention of the own state; rescue-plans, new rules, and V. A. distribution of support-funds: Since the crisis became more and more seriously, the USA are to be escaped merely in the economic layer without foreign help. 
And beside the methods, they possess in addition also the legitimation to use these: consequently two not to überwertende prerequisites? under certain circumstances?, will be able to fall back no international organization and no market in similar manner on which normally probably. 
Besides, that new emphasis, that is put on the state-national element, is in perfect unison with the ever bigger meaning, that is brought sector in connection in the economy with one on the narrowest relation recently,: the Territorialität. 
It is exactly now paradoxical manner as we were so confident from it however to have entered a connected total-empire long ago, into an empire of the always varied technologies, the immaterial, that we must determine all at once, as our future will depend on the essentially material things however more and more: Water, harvest and oil. 
These can admittedly be transported all of a place at the other of the world certain, is however nevertheless connected on most outer with a narrowly altered piece of earth? a territory. 
Therefore, the one, that owns such a territory, is with respect to another, that in a harvest-unproductive, water-draws lots or from Ölvorkommen woos area lives, in the advantage. 
I now come to the second newness, that presupposes a short in-thrust however. 
Whoever says territory, who government, who politics says also Leadership with it. 
In this sense, the finance-crisis seems to generate two convergent phenomenons. 
On the one hand the knowledge is there respectable Leaderships, therefore the need after somebody, that knows, about the necessity as one regulates the things. 
On the other side, a wave of the indignation now insists over the existing leaderships, V. A. those of the economics, which have turned out as inadequate and full shadow-zones. 
To it, a deep enough finally comes and in certain sense even worrying aspect: A trust-loss, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance, that turn altogether towards a whole class of managers of the western countries. 
It seems to itself the conviction so to clear the way under big sharings of the population that not it first the actions of the social elite but already her/its/their idea-world, her/its/their Way of Life, her/its/their culture in the widest sense of the word, is, whose salary itself the majority as more and more strangely and come over represents. 
The demand after Leadership nurtures one branched, however mighty movement of the Entmachtung of the leading class and the conventional political establishment therefore underground. This manifestiert itself in unforeseen " revolts " of the voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective nature-condition of the last time: beginning with the ascent of the conservative in Austria and Bavaria, over the breakdown of the Labour-Partei in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American deputy against Bush and maybe also the victory of the rights plays a role in Italy here. 
One wins the impression, as has the old elite, her/its/their parties, her/its/their programs, but also her/its/their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say her/its/their format, more and more understanding-problems and therefore less representative value respecting his, what goes on in the low social layers of the west nowadays and still reinforces from the finance-crisis and until is driven to the Überdimensionalität. 
Countenance's all his would simply be it exaggerated to speak of a " rebellion of the masses ". 
It certainly is not meanwhile to hold the eyes far however frankly.
