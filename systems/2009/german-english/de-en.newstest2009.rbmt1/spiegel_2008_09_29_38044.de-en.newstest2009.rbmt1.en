Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box 
As should introduce Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, itself at the first schoolday at the Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to giggle: The German is kawaii " totally "! 
What the means? 
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange-log tells her/it/them from Japan. 
" The first schoolday in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Already before the school-way, I had jitters. 
I live at the edge of Tokyo in direction Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I have not gotten lost. 
The instruction-beginning doesn't seem at the Tachibana as strictly as fixed with us in Lower Saxony at home. 
The students trudeln from eight o'clock one, until a short discussion-round begins about twenty before nine with the teacher, that ' home room'. 
However before the instruction began, I was next to introduce me. 
I am still the type, that likes to speak in front of people, with it to it before a class of 40 students not at all. 
Because I still had no school-uniform, I have put on an old skirt of my guest-mother, to it blouse, blue stockings and black leather-shoes. 
In this elevator, I have therefore placed myself in front of the desk and have tried to pronounce everything right: ' Sayonara Wo she Sylvana... ' - I hot Sylvana, comes from Germany and has birthday in a week. 
At the moment I was very glad that I had already started to learn the language well two years ago. 
The 31 girls in the class have whispered all, giggled and gewunken and continuously I have heard the word " Kawaii ". 
I already knew that from my Mangases. 
It belongs to the survive-important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means ' cute, süß'. 
Then, I have scurried quickly on my place. 
The girl beside me has grinned rather broadly, she/it found it a honor that the exchange-schoolgirl should sit beside her/it/them. 
The rest of the hour was rather quiet, sounded however as the gong, I was stormed downright. 
All spoke in confusion and giggled and asked me holes into the stomach - with it is it really heavy to understand Japanese English. 
All her/its/their Bentos unpacked in the pause then. 
My guest-mother had made also such a Lunchbox for me - that is something else than the desolate German trace-breads once. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a type meat in the Tofumantel. 
Usually I have no pale glimmer what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The things look strangly and taste good completely new. 
Solidly it stands that everything is really more delicious. 
Naja, until on the salty inlaid plums maybe, brrrr! 
The Bentoses are simply lunches at Japanese schools not only. 
It sometimes occurs that a girl gives a boy an even prepared Bento, that she/it dresses especially skillfully then, - in the hope, to know the boy with the Pausensnack near, to learn. 
I have read from it in my Manga-Comics. 
I am once tense whether I can also observe that here. 
' Why then especially Japan? ', have my friends asked me as I told them that I want to go for one year in Tokyo to the school. 
I have always said then: 
" Because it simply fascinates " me. 
Finally, I read Mangas already for years the most dearly. 
And with it I the comics and the culture in it better understands, I have also started someday to learn a little Japanese. 
It was therefore completely clear for me that I had to travel here someday. 
Because I have also a weakness for tradition, manners and customs. 
And one puts big value on them/her/it here. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the newest technologies and trends - on the other side is strict it, disciplines and traditional. 
And because all so well is organized, I have not lost felt here as well even if Tokyo is the biggest city, that I have ever seen.
