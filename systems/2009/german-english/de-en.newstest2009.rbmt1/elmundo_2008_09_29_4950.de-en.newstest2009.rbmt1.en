For the Olympic games, the streets are defective in Madrid. 
Yes, the dream of many of us is to be organized some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it can be 2016 however maybe. 
But I wonder: `Sind we for it prepares? ' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not correct! 
She/it was called perfect street, and according to my judgment, she/it was the worst street with all, that there was, therefore and at it. 
Nonsense is natural the one bulk, if they heeded the evaluation and I could test it, something similar would not have come through unequivocally. 
But, we go through everything from the beginning. 
The nonsense starts with the Ticketholen, that licenses you to go as first. 
It seems to me not to be bad either, but if they let you already proceed, they should give you also everything, including chip, in order to avoid the jams on the street. 
Therefore however not. 
Here, they leave you get only the ticket, that first nonsense, that consists of it, only therefore to go there, and, after an infinite line, the surprise is there! There was the T-shirt only in the size `S ', a second nonsense, because I need the size XL, 
Where do we actually live then? 
Oder is it so that was adjudicated after the crisis to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less material? 
Therefore good, matters like these are a small thing in the comparison to the days on the street. 
Apart from it, that one must go very early in order to get the chip, a line of at least 15 minutes is already there and, furthermore, one must let the backpack lie. 
The attendant has lasted more than 35 minutes, what in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected, is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as also expecting it was, the street started and we had not let our return-sacks lie before it, even if it was successful once, but getting back her/it/them would already be more difficult. 
Furthermore, it saw, in these 40 minutes wait after rain from, sodass it to the temptation, to organize a people-rebellion and to attack the little house, came. 
I believe, mornings will have some 500 people pneumonia surely and some like I will appear because of this chip, that I have received, with the Klassifikation not once in time, I can already think that the exit was stamped incorrectly. 
Of course, if they asked me about a perfect street, I would never think of this street. 
So I believe, we will still dream of a city, that is well prepared for the Olympic games, long
