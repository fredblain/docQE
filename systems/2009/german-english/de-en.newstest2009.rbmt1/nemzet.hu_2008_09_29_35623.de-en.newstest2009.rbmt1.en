The right camp is intact, only the voters became more self-confidently within the camp - so writes a commentary on " the weak performance of the CSU the mirror " in Bavaria. 
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to the, in order to prevent a red-black coalition, reigns. 
The mirror (spiegel.de) 
In the on-line-edition of the German news-magazine settled left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the CSU exterminated her/its/their fathers " in his/its article " of Bavaria revolution. 
The erosion of the CSU began in the opinion of the renowned political scientist for a long time before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took on his/its offices. 
The Christsozialens have renewed Bavaria over decades - now turns away exactly the modern citizens of them. 
The epoch-break is a problem of the Christian-democracy simultaneously, like also for Angela Merkel. 
Completely surprising didn't come the disaster of the CSU, but on Sunday, something has come to an end which however already began to emerge rather precisely ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state-party 
Because already before ten years, 1998, the CSU lands with 47,7 percent and fell with it since the fifties under the fifty-percent-brand for the first time 
The repeated itself three years ago with the Bundestag-elections 2005, therefore still in her/it many quoted Stoiber-Äras. 
The modernization logically driven by the CSU in the state has exterminated too good last her/its/their own mothers and fathers. 
Sociologists had already predicted that 40 years ago, itself with it however in the speed considerably verschätzt. Could the secularization however without effects, that educational-success, the popularity of east - and North German into the prosperierenden regions of Bavaria on the fidelity of the CSU-voters don't remain. 
Modernization always walks around with option-increase. And that has political consequences. 
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more headstrong. 
It is showy that the classic citizen-groups virtually expressed the biggest distance to the CSU in the last weeks: the free occupations, the industrial bourgeoisie and voters with high school diploma like college degree. 
Here, the support of the CSU sank on even under 40 percent. 
The press (diepresse.com) 
The conservative Viennese daily reports in her/its/their " who with whom? Party-bosses reservedly in coalition-questions " titled articles over the chaotic domestically situation in Austria after the reelections. 
The SPÖ would like to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits itself the interference of the SPÖ into internal issues. 
The BZÖ points frankly in all directions for conversations while the members of the Greens Party want not yet to commit themselves in reference to a coalition. 
The reelections are past, and now everything rotates around the coalition; in the debates in the legal television let the party-bosses hardly look into her/its/their cards. 
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his/its wish, with which to want to negotiate ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation of both parties is possible very probably - in some states and in the socially-partnership is already this the case. 
The question, whether he/it could introduce himself/itself a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the present ÖVP-Chef as vice-chancellors, then, Faymann left frankly. 
As he/it said, the voters would have voted out the Schüssel-Molterer-Kurs. 
A repetition of this direction was not possible. 
Molterer has reacted carefully to red offers meanwhile. 
The cooperation could not be fertile, he/it thought if Faymann tries to interfere with internal concerns of the ÖVP.
