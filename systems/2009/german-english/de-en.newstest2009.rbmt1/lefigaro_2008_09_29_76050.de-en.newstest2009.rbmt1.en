Sarkozy meets furious fishers 
Before he/it flies to the united states, Nicolas Sarkozy will do another excursion into the Brittany. 
In view of the resolved stand of the fishers, that blockaded the Zufahrten to several bretonischens and Norman harbors on Monday, the French president decided to appear Tuesday morning in the harbor of Guilvinec in the Finistère, about itself there, to meet with their representative. 
Latter promised, him/it `mit a constructive Geist', to receive, and hopes, that he/it comes with `konkreten Vorschlägen'. 
The visit of the president takes place at the same time like a general-meeting of the crisis-committee that was established by the bretonischen fishers, in order to push through measures in view of the extreme increase of the diesel-price, that a record-value on average of over 1,14 Euro per liter has reached. 
According to the press-speaker of the Elyséepalasts David Martinon `wird the president with them possible solutions, in order to help her/its/their businesses, discusses to become competitive again, and the job-conditions and the payment of the sailors to sichern'. 
Sarkozy is expected by the fishers with determination. 
They quoted Tuesday morning in the Morbihan and Calvados protest-marches, the jams of almost ten kilometers of length caused. 
The sail-harbor of Quiberon was also blockaded, the connections to Belle-île didn't break off however. 
The peninsula of Quiberon was delimited with a barrier. 
Already on Monday the sailors of her/its/their determination lent expression in that they burned from the early morning at tires and palettes before the fuel-warehouses of the harbors of Brest and Lorient while demonstrations were kept away in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc. 
The movement widened on other harbors the Atlantic-coast and the sleeve-canal, like for example Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish-cutters didn't drive out, or Le Havre, where approximately twenty boats blockaded the maneuvers of the trading ships. 
The fishers of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total-refinery in Donges in the evening. 
That from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting on Wednesday in the ministry before they decide on possible measures. 
Actually the crisis-committee must in Guilvinec over the reactions on the movement and over his/its participation at her/it in the ministry for agriculture and fishery adjudicates planned discussion in Paris. 
But some bretonische fishers don't want represented from the responsible of the national fishery-committee that her/its/their movement has not supported. 
`Der strike becomes weitergehen', because `die Fischer don't become nachgeben' and `wollens in no point to Paris gehen', Liliane Cariou, president of the fishery-committee of Lorient, announced for example. 
The liter costs the occupation-fishers, who pay no taxes on diesels, currently approximately 50 cents, but they think that the profitability-border of a boat can be reached only with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
