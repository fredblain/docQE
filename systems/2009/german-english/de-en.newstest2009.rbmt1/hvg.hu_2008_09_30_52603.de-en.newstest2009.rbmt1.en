You are which you communicate over you 
On the occasion of her/its/their tenth birthday, Google can claim with justification and right: she/it is to be found equally in the bags of the people, as over her/its/their heads at the heaven: She/it knows where the people have spent her/its/their vacation to which specialists they go, and something she/it moves. 
And with it still not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managers of Google. 
In direction skeptics, that are troubled by Orwellschen horror-visions, has organized he/it: These would overlook the essential of the Web 2.0 precisely. 
Schmidt thought in an interview with the Financial Time lately, the main goal of Google is it to collect personal data over the users even more and according to the original objective of the company, to come near, according to what she/it " wants to sort " all information of this world. 
Schmidt explained, Google is still world-changing work after ten years at the beginning of the Informations-Sammelns only. 
Asked Quo after the status in five years Schmidt thought: he/it wished, Google would be in the situation, I should do " questions like " what tomorrow? or " which job really goes with me "? , to answer, however software-programs are not yet in the situation to it since they would not know sufficiently about the users. 
Not all Internet-Users are in the clear to itself over it that the Suchbegriffes would be registered in the course of her/its/their Internet-Recherchen, as well as also the IP-Adressen, from which from was sought, and the visited sides. 
For example the Personalized Search " introduced " two years ago licenses the visitor to store his/its own Suchverlauf and to fall back on it later, sodass the hits later much more precisely can be generated, and also the so named " Recommendationses ", with which the system recommends custom products and services on the basis of the former preferences, are based on the same logic. 
The User wonder however - " if one, which I do ", looks - appears some procured whether the Google-Datenmonopols. 
In most cases, it is however rather that of the company represented, potenzielle power, that works fear exhilarating, and less the compunction or the fear before punishment, the quest after freedom or rebelling against the power that pushes with many Internet-Userns on refusal. 
It is a proven fact however, that the Suchbegriffes are stored not only but are relayed in the Anlassfall also at third, and in this Gesetzesf채llen, there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet-Users. 
A parade-example for this was the action against P채dophilie in Brazil, in the course of his Google of the Brazilian government gave information, that was collected by the Gemeinschaftssite by the name of " Orkut " and enabled also an identification of the P채dophilien, lately. 
User concerned about personal rights could however still breathe a sigh of relief in May as Google pulled successfully with the franchise-organization EFF against the FBI before court together: therefore, Google can be forced also in future with no point of the constitution into it, information the FBI, to publish on secret inquiry. 
, However the Federal government has obtained the publication of 50.000 Web-addresses and 1.000 Suchbegriffens under reference on the youth-protection-law given a farewell years ago successfully, however the list of the individual User became her/it/them, respectively their Web - and Suchbegriffsliste on two months retroactively withholds.) 
Googles image therefore remains controversial: Those, that publish her/its/their personal data unwillingly, because she/it through the application of the Google-Dienste the loss her/its/their private - and private life fears, conservatively representing companies of proper revolt chastise the business with her/it him/it itself. 
Meanwhile, the American " Geek-Kultur " sees that is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer-fans, activists and User eint, the next generation of the " cool entrepreneurs " in them, in contrast to Microsoft, that is thanks to Windows Marktf체hrer, even if fights both around the same goal. 
A possible reason for this it is that Google demands his/its Usern in contrast to Microsoft no identification-codes, and his/its services gratuitously to the disposal puts, sodass an open, constantly updated source code and Programm-Package much attractive, youthful and cool, to be, seems, as the official methods of the software-giant. 
On the other hand, the Geekses understand the problematic relationship of the personal right and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship, that has especially moved in the last years thanks to the concept " Web 2.0 " into the center. 
With the " Web 2.0 " goes it about nothing other namely, than about collaboration, speaks that User leave on purpose tracks and is of use the available communication-canals, and even if the sizes are individually different, the most important thing remains the same to appear namely publicly. 
An average teenager can administer his/its profile on several Gemeinschaftsportalen simultaneously - from Facebook over Xanga, this can by means of other services, like approximately Twitter, or music-services connect like last.fm together, and can finally tie in all this into a Nachverfolgungssystem like approximately FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead Blogs, that represents the newest photo-galleries, that are geostets on Flickr or Picasa, automatically. 
And a row of further exemplary cases proves: The friend finds out with the respect of the party-photos of the bygone night soon, with whom her/its/their disloyal friend has had a good time, or the co-worker is released because he/it makes his/its anger in his/its Blog over the management air only all too honestly - an is sure: The concept " privacy " was interpreted fully again in the meantime. 
Whoever leads an on-line-life is that, which he/it announces from itself, - so in for example could formulate the reason-idea behind the behavior of the present-day youth one. 
And whoever tries to hold somewhat secretly, or cooks to handle the Google-Monopol, that can like to do - like approximately with Scroogle, a Tool, that admittedly accesses the Suchmaschine of Google, however on purpose no tracks leaves. 
Not few people don't register on community-sides on purpose so that they are not findable, but also the on-line-applications of Google, as approximately Textverarbeitungs - and graphic Tools and RSS-Feeds, has handled itself alternative versions, that are tied at no gigantic server-parks and don't generate the best possible profile of the User therefore either. 
The public opinion waits entranced on it meanwhile until Google shows her/its/their true face. 
With her/its/their present value of USD 156 bil. lie the business before IBM even, USD 140 bil.), Intel, USD 124 bil.) or Coca-Cola, USD 110 bil.), the advertising-surfaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of the advertising-agencies, and the services more quickly introduced always make ready not only Microsoft but also other software-developers head-breakup. 
Critical observers find however also the worrying counterpoles: So the concern-management has fully rejected a protest of the co-workers approximately, after the dues of the company kindergarten were doubled, furthermore the management, that is mehrmalige food of the co-workers, thought too costly. That of everything appears however virtually mildly against it that Google even went in the year 2006 before the Chinese government into the knees and agreed with an agreement after what all regime-critical hits, or those, that offend against the good taste, would be out-filtered. 
The internal regulation of the concern is that no new service is applied in advance but only when this is also already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and year could roll up some powerfully again: While some thinks, Googles book - and Magazinscan - as well as Archivierungsprojekt assumes sizes in the meantime that the business had to have it out with the colonel court of justice soon, is rather others worried because of the system " Health " so, that the preparation of a complete health-profile on the basis of from results, doctors and problems enables. 
And the fact, that Google builds a genetic data base, already delivers the material to the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors - approximately " Scroogled ", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes a future, in which a human being becomes nahbar thanks to data referential by Google startling, in best orwellschen manner.
