You don't think - then pays! 
An emotion-loaded campaign directs to motorists 
Most expensive action to the security on the streets in the Czech history. 
Also so, the emotion-loaded media-campaign, that wants to start the traffic-ministry on Wednesday, could be characterized. 
The authority of Minister Ale? ?ebí?ek makes a slip of the tongue from it to discourage drivers of dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million crowns becomes in the television, in the radio, in the cinema, in the Internet, but also on Flyern runs. 
She/it shall the drivers from to fast Fahrweise and alcohol at the wheel discourages. 
And they also at it remind, itself before departure to angurten. 
The campaign wants above all young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and doesn't finally speak also occupation-drivers into the conscience. 
And something is shown in the spots? 
Above all histories of people, that appeal to emotions. 
Also the " bloody " slogan of the whole campaign testifies: 
You don't think - then pays! 
The words " doesn't think stands in capital letters on a mark-sign. 
And the word " stands in a blood-puddle then pays ". 
This should mean that one can pay a moment to inattentiveness with the own life. 
The spots will shock " the spectators until 2010 ". 
The ministry could be inspired from similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries where one can see pictures with drastic receptions of casualties quite normally. 
It makes a slip of the tongue that the accident-numbers and the number of the traffic-dead person sink to the Czech streets so. 
The spots became agency from that Euro RSCG composed. 
Sugar-bread and whip for the motorists 
" To the drivers, the motto is applied sugar-bread and whip. 
Sugar-bread means that she/it, if they drive with red for example, time saves. 
The whip is the threat of a penalty or an accident then. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk, according to the traffic-psychologist of the hospital well Homolce Martin Ko?án. 
And therefore information-campaigns are in the press and above all negative advertisement necessary, the psychologist thinks. 
Is of his/its opinion already less effective after blackboards, that the drivers alert to a danger. 
One " put a static blackboard, that warns of a danger, on will flow away these with the surroundings probably soon, and the drivers will perceive " her/it/them no longer, Ko?án thinks.
