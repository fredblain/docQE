Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumble-bee 
What would be the best method to the development of new technologies to the accident-avoidance if to imitate not the obstacle-sensors from the nature? 
For example that of the bees. 
An astonishing project, with which the Nissan-Ingenieures of bumble-bees were inspired new accident of avoiding systems with the creation, was introduced with the CEATEC in Japan. 
In cooperation with the Tokioter university, Nissan has built the biomimetic system of the type BR23C controlled by car-robots, a mini-car, equipped with the qualities of the bees, with the goal to support the development of a system, that each collisions avoid. 
In the flight, each bee forms her/its/their own, oval " privacy ", that our own " shield " is very similar, Kazuhhiro Doi said, product-managers for Technologie-PR and research-development, at the showing. 
The composite eye of the bee, that can see into each direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role with it. 
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance-knife. 
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates her/its/their distances and sends signals at the microprocessor at board, that immediately introduces the collision-avoiding process. 
The obstacle is registered in second-fractions, and the car-robot immediately alters the course, like the movement of the bees, in that he/it turns the tires about the corresponding angle. 
This maneuver takes place purely instinctively in contrast to previous systems. 
" If it was not so, the car-robot could not react declared Toshiyuki Andoh, leaders of the " Mobility Laboratory " and the car-robot-project, sufficiently quickly in order to avoid " the obstacles. 
The system must respond instinctively and immediately since this technology corresponds to the most inner and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer, within the accidents at present still as unvermeidbar is valid. 
The entire process must reflect holding back of the bees if they avoid other bees. 
And that must run out in the fraction of a second. 
However, the evasion, in contrast to the bees, doesn't can up, down, or takes place even diagonally - it can be only two-dimensional, in fact only in direction of the Wendbarkeit of the tires. 
While infinitely many possibilities stand the bees here frankly in order to avoid other bees, the researchers could themselves with the car-robot of only the rotation, respectively the accelerates and brake serves. 
The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, that is easier and energy-more efficient, and a longer lifespan therefore has, as conventional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. 
Andoh explained, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less, to store these on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability. 
This appliance must process some inputs per second merely and accordingly on her/it/them must respond. 
It must this doesn't store, or on the basis of former maneuvers an intuitive, logical reaction produces, sodass it continuously merely one handful KB of memory in claim takes. 
It needs no gigabytes - and megabyte-heavy Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision-avoidance-technology, that will be after assessment of Nissan within the next ten years in production in series. 
Another application could find the technology with the GPS-Satellitennavigation in that it steers the motorist about obstacles around consciously and leads him/it at the goal so.
