These digits cover the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes as many deaths as through murders almost doubly, originates. 
Today becomes the Anmil, Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi Del Lavoro, in all provinces of Italy the 58. national day for the victims of work-accidents commits, all the the attention of the social institutions and media, to steer on this dramatic situation. 
" The worrying, from Anmil dispersed data and the tragic news of these days it confirms how decisively the question of the Prävention is " at the job., the president of the republic confirms Giorgio Napolitano in his/its communication at him/it president of the Amil, Associazione nazionale mutilati Ed invalidi Del lavoro, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses his/its " big esteem for the constant commitment to the Prävention at the jobs, to the protection of the injured workers, to the allowance for the families of the victims and to the sensitization of the public opinion ". 
" An indignant " enough " has risen hereupon; clearly with tragedies, that, measured at her/its/their magnitude, some whirl in the media and sympathy of the public causes. However the everyday reality confronts us with dramatic events, that can even recur in her/its/their momentum, frequently. 
Napolitano doesn't hide that " there is in any case also a resource-problem: it must be invested in formation and piece of information decisively. 
A special meaning assumes the numerous enterprise for a more direct Bewusstwerdung in school-frameworks on the part of the teenager, that nurtures itself the working world. 
It is our duty to direct the attention toward this phenomenon and to distract not from his/its social seriousness. One must put down a legislative norm in strength and must improve. 
For his part, the president of the chamber of Gianfranco Fini has emphasized " an urgent social emergency like the phenomenon of the work-related deaths forms, which the conscience of us all offends and all institutions to it forces to to-work on decided rules, that the goal has, the problem to put down " an end.

" As believes, that one undertakes in reason too little in order to confront the phenomenon of the accidents. One can fight through different actions against it. 
Stronger controls and inspections are after necessary of our opinion? according to Mercandelli; however also stronger measures to the enlightenment of the workers, that already begins " in the school. 
" Another effort is necessarily - so adds he/it - what the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion concerns. 
But in particular a bigger responsibility-feeling of sides of the employers is a phenomenon, that represents a social emergency, opposite asked ".
