The USA can introduce themselves without Paul Newman badly 
`Manchmal manages God perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was one of it. ' 
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, that with him/it in `Sensationsreporterin ' worked together, and from the at that time ruling idea of the US-American cinema which became calm in the sting, from whole America until Newman with his/its exciting idea came and her followed. 
Look simply what it cost her/it/them him/it to lend the Oscar. 
And as he/it retreated 2007. 
And he/it knew that he/it was very sick. 
Nevertheless, that was for finished a big hit. 
`Was one sometimes feels, is essentially more than an expression, and now I have a big friend verloren', Robert Redford said crying, `mein lives and my country were the biggest oddness of his/its life. ' 
No one had neither to make fear for itself ridiculously still to exaggerate. 
As `Vater ' the cinema and the fatherland has died he/it in a sad moment, in which fear prevails before terrorists and before the market-breakdown, in which the dejected self-esteem of the US-Americans is on the hopeless search after reasons in order to get back dignity. 
If only few people, that one can admire, remain in this hard time without virtue, so one must not necessarily be Luis Cernuda, about Paul Newman too dear. 
For all, he/it embodied a platonic ideal of the beauty and the truth quasi. 
He/it was official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered like different losses as well as also profits: from the foundation, that has prescribed itself to the fight against the drugs and was established in honor of his/its son from the first marriage, that died of overdose, until to the own brand of house-done and organic products. 
That of everything is a gift for the country, in which it cost him/it much effort, to become generally accepted against a deadly nutritional-culture. 
A wide wave of the amazement beats to take towering over Hollywood regardless of nationalities and citizenship. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that is dead not only one human being but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film-director and Oscar-prizewinners, said, that the work with Newman was less than the top of his/its career no longer or not. 
Russell Crowe, the evil boy, who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his/its biggest inspiration. 
`Uns has all verlassen' the biggest of us, George Clooney, maybe one of few, who dares today, confirmed to live tries like Paul Newman lived: high requests at the righteousness get, a responsible private life, far from which cameras remove, leads. 
That possibly is not in the present-day media-jungle simply or not once always. 
But there is somebody, that tries it, and Paul Newman was an example for it. 
He/it had a time parted and was fifty years married after it to Joanne Woodward, that was loyal he/it, although there were surely many possibilities not to be it. 
`Wozu should eat a Hamburg I on the street if I have fillet at home? ', did he/it often joke even. 
In the heaven, he/it will be on it with pride that his/its daughters have the same opinion as his/its fans on the earth which is not absolutely usual in America. 
`Von all big roles, that he/it played, on no one was as proud as on them/her/it of the loyal spouse he/it, the loved father, the aware grandpa and that of the Philanthropen', they say.
