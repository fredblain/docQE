Outside opinion - the orwellsche speech of Barrick gold 
In her/its/their edition of the 17. September published Le Devoir a letter dated Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-general director of the Canadian gold-mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and pursues an orwellsche logic with it that the biggest gold-extraction-society of the world a slander-complaint over six millions against three authors and a young impecunious publishing house-home strove for, with the goal, a `öffentliche, to open transparent Debatte'. 
If it is correct, that the judges are independent and impartial, then they don't pass a judgment on the truth, above all not in the case of slander-complaints but over the law. 
As expect, this basic difference became completely discreet from Mr. Garver. 
Because for Barrick gold, the best type is one to lead a public debate to drive everyone into the ruin, that it dares, that its reverse notion to represent. 
Quite same, as the process goes out, the authors and the editor of the book of Noir Canada will have to pass out considerable sums in order to prepare her/its/their defense and to fight with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers, that are paid from the nearly inexhaustible bags of the gold-mine. 
The tactic with these unequal fights is often besides to be ruined the defenders in order to force an einvernehmliche regulation, that the other side makes silent, and furthermore everyone, that dares it, to deal with the question again, deters. 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, she/it would have had to present her/its/their view of the things before the public opinion. 
In contrast to it, what in many that countries, in which Barrick gold works, walk and would give is, normally becomes debates in Canada through the exchange of ideas and delivered not through stick-blows. 
It would therefore have sufficed if the gold-mine had disclosed her/its/their books and files and a real debate would have opened, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent Prüfteams that would have been able to bring light into this question. 
But Barrick gold seems no trust to have into the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a sweep of the hand aside. 
Could Mr. Garver explain maybe, as simultaneously he/it about a `öffentliche ' debate can ask and with it however the opinions just this public disregards? 
Seemingly, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers in the world of the vice-president, and not the community of all Canadians; a quite beautifully restricted view-manner of the concept. 
In a democracy, slanderers even have to speak the right. 
What Barrick gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is, that the public, that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, therefore toots this above all, because she/it refuses the brutal stand of the gold-mine. 
This public is ready to it to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework, that many perceive as gag-complaint, in the course of the `öffentlichen Debatte', Barrick gold has directed exactly a demand at the authors of Noir Canada, in which she/it demands from them, to use this concept no longer...). 
Apart from the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on the freedom to the academic research and the truth-finding that is fundamentally for each democratic society. 
She/it denies the right completely to quote believable sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, that the basis of the intellectual work forms. 
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore topics and to discuss, that pleased not the rich businesses of this world, whoever can do that then otherwise? 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she/it could lead these in that she/it follows the scientific norms, that use from the authors of Noir Canada, became. 
She/it has a right to answer. 
The universitäre surroundings, to which we belong, knows for a long time to get the grip on debates and incongruities and to solve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that she/it, in contrast to him/it, which she/it pretends, has no desire on a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university-world, equally like for the public debate, and it becomes time that the governments take measures, that restrict this type of unjustified complaints.
