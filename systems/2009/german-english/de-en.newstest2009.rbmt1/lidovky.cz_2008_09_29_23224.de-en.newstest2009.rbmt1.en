The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the USA 
The Sudeten German had requested in the year 1945 about the incorporation of the Böhmerwaldes at the united states. 
This follows from a letter, that stores in the collections of the Südböhmischen scientific library. 
If we cannot be component of Germany or Austria, so we would like to live under the patronage of the united states from America at least. 
With such a wish, 1945 should have turned some groups of Sudeten German to the US-Präsidenten. 
This sinks has remained from a letter, that gets in a private-archive, forth and that is stored in the collections of the Südböhmischen scientific library today. 
The German of Krumau ask the American president in the letter, he/it shall the return of the " Sudeten-district " - that on the basis of the Münchener agreement of Hitler was earned - at the Czechoslovakia doesn't allow. 
" We have understood the situation right and want really to be us sure the words that the American units as oppressors and enemies don't enter German territory but as rescuers ", it is called in a letter, that with the words " people, that the fate of the Sudeten at the hugs lies " signed is. 
Since the connection at the Czechoslovakia the Sudeten German - in knowledge of the Czech national-character - has suspected, that they would expect brutality, thoughtlessness, Unverständnis, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take on for today and forever the protectorate over the Böhmerwald. 
" We cannot believe, that you speak regardless of the opinion one quarter-millions residents this area a state foreign for us, that suppresses minorities and tries to remove and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allied Forces purely, to read in the letter is. 
The reason for it, why the authors cannot sign, the fear is before revenge-desires of the " Czech oppressors " supposedly. 
If the US-Präsident doubt tends at the fundamental attitude of the Böhmerwalddeutschen, be it sufficient if he/it initiated a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau over it whether the inhabitants become part of the USA or wanted to live under the protectorate of the united states. 
Albeit the text of the letter may somewhat naively sound in present-day knowledge of the postwar-history, he/it draws a good picture regarding the then expectations of the Sudeten German according to opinion of some time-witnesses however. 
Even if the Bohemian German had to suspect at least, that they would negotiate her/its/their deportation from the republic, only few of them admitted themselves such a possibility at all. 
Some waited that the united states and Great Britain for the Sudeten would negotiate a type autonomy. 
Again others believed, they could simply remain in the Czechoslovakia. 
Also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis, confirms them/her/it. 
He/it was put into the war as Budweiser Deutscher with the navy at the Baltic sea. 
As he/it came the war into British captivity in the end and they brought him/it into a war-prisoner camp after Holstein, further Bohemian Germans came dozen to him/it, he/it should teach them Czech. 
" You/they believed, if they came home, that would become them Czech to fits comes ", according to Chalupa. 
Nobody of the German war-prisoner, that had lived before the war in the Czechoslovakia, reckoned according to his/its opinion with it that they would expel him/it on the basis of the Bene?-Dekrete from the republic.
