Speak in the sleep 
Some children speak at night 
I my not the ones, that wake up and tell us something, which has happened on the day before it, with it, but the children, who speak during the sleep. 
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be terrified, but in the reality, that has no meaning. 
That is a positive insomnia, that is named speaking in the sleep. 
She/it is rather dispersed, above all with the children and teenagers. 
Surely, was told by you more than one, that you have spoken at night. 
This phenomenon can appear occasionally, a time in the life, for example, as while the up temperature, or regular, every day, a time per week, a time in the month, on the next day, the child can remember at nothing. 
There is no single reason, that causes this appearance. 
Often, for contexts are looked with other appearances in the sleep, like nightmares, panic-stricken fear at night, Enuresis noctura, bedwetting at night, speaking in the sleep sought, but there is no reason for it. 
As we have mentioned it already earlier, fiber, Stresssituationen or overstrain can care about very high. 
In any case, that is a little explored phenomenon. 
The frequency, with which it appears, is very variable. 
It can be, that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can an opposite completely his/its, screams, wines, long discussions. 
In the cases, if the remark is very intensive, is recommended to observe the child and to let discuss itself with a specialist in order to check whether a problem, which fear causes and comes this way about, is available. 
We have said, that it is a positive disturbance, therefore it is not treated, be it, she/it is connected with another insomnia, that can be treated, for example, with which Schlaf-Apnoe or with the Stress. 
What one can do is, a string of simple prevention-measures enforces: 
Attempts, to excite the child before not sleeping. 
Therefore, stressful television-programs pick out quiet game for the child and avoid, that awfully and something too wild is. 
With the nervous children, whom relaxations are recommended, relaxation-methods can be applied in order to help them to receive a certain inner silence. 
That helps the child to sleep quietly. 
If speaking occurs in the sleep once, tries to protect the silence. 
Think of it that it is harmless for the child and will be able to remind it itself on the next day at nothing, which has happened. 
Useful advices 
Don't wake it. 
That is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will wake up it rudely. 
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, therefore it rests. 
Think of it, if it turns out verängstigt after one pair of appearances, so it is recommended, which reason the child has for the fear discusses to leave or to find out. 
If they understand, what it says, what is not so usual, the child doesn't put down under pressure in order to enforce an interrogation and, to work out more piece of information. 
You will be able to so reach nothing with it, because if the child sleeps, it is unconsciously and cannot think about it. 
Furthermore, you will hear, what it says, but you won't know, what it dreams and why it says that, therefore they are ends, that you pull out of it, with the interpretation of the piece of information and him/it carefully. 
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that hears her/it/them that at night and knows his/its secrets. 
Not once as joke. 
That causes much fear. 
Therefore, makes you no worries, it is nothing bad, that is a moment, that lasts only few minutes.
