Isabel Bayón calls back the memory at the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia 
A flamenco-dancer from Sevilla admires a dancer, who comes also from Sevilla. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her/its/their father was Catalan, Florenç Tórtola Ferrer, and the mother Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she/it is born in the quarter of Triana and as she/it three years old was, her/its/their family has moved to London. 
She/it was a dancer and expert for Oriental dances. 
She/it had an exciting life, she/it was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She/it was Buddhist, vegetarian and sat. 
The life of this woman, that has left her/its/their tracks with the dance - and aesthetics-revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón. 
`Ich wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she/it has proposed me this role which appeared to me impossibly. ' 
`Wirs don't try to tell about her/its/their life, separates to protect her/its/their esprit, ' said the flamenco-dancer. 
Her/its/their dance-bases have helped me in flamenco much. 
`Der dance of the Schmetterlings' felt to me like Guajira for example, or `der dance of the Schlange' like tango. 
You dancing was sensually and me has been said that my dancing also in this aesthetic area liegt', she/it claims. 
The production reckons with two exceptional cooperations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel with one of her/its/their ideas again, as he/it has done it also in `La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco-master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work as an exception together with one of her/its/their ex-schoolgirls. 
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very ripe personality. 
I am happy, because she/it agreed to be contributed to my work, and I feel honored very much. ' 
The production reckons also with musical composition and the Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the chant of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion from El Pájaro, just as the viol of Rafa El viol and the cooperation with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he/it `übernimmt the role of the companion of the artists that divas, with which he/it falls in love again and again, were. ' 
In this work, one tells also on a certain manner of the life of this woman, that in so far situated places like India, the united states or Russia and furthermore in whole Europe known it became although she/it has normally lived in London. 
`Ich wanted to call back her/it/them in memory, because I think, she/it is one of the women that has an enormous influence on a certain epoch and today their work no more and, therefore to estimate her/it/them even less, weiß', Bayón claims. 
The idea takes place about 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega today.
