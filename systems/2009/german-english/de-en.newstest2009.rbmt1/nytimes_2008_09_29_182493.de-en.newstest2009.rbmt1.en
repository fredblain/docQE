Debate about bilingual education: Formation in English-language surroundings 
In this edition of the " Education Watch ", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific co-worker in Kalifonischen studies and leading director in the school educational-sciences at the Pacific Research institute for Public Policy, a co-author of the book " is not as good as one thinks: Why the method-class needs " a varsity. 
A complicated task is to be gone down well with the hispanischen voters. 
Barrack Obamas suggestions to the topic formation are a typical example for it. 
Obamas election-campaign mentions, that " the likelihood to complete the school with afro-amerikanischen and hispanischen students successfully, lower is, as with white students " - what is correct. 
In order to close this performance-distance, Obamas educational-plan specifically recommends under others a bilingual transition-phase in the education for the ones, that learn English first. 
Nevertheless the question consists at Obama of it whether his/its use for the bilingual education, that puts the main focus on instruction in other languages as English, disagrees with his/its interest to reduce the distance in the school-performances. 
Let's take Sixth Street Prep ", a primary school in the eastern Los Angeles, as example ". 
Hispanisches are the majority of the students and come from families with low income. 
Learns English more than a third of the students, from which many are only since short in the country. 
Nevertheless, students of the fourth class have insisted the state-examination into 2008 astonishing 100 percent in Mathe on a good level. 
Also surprising became 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year in the English-examination as well assesses. 
This astonishing success was reached with other methods, as the ones, that are preferred by Obama. 
The school of Sixth Street puts her/its/their main focus on checkup and practice, on steady control of the knowledge and a stand, that tolerate no exceptions. 
The school practices the base, after which the education proceeds in an English-language surroundings, the further. Exactly that is the point, that Obama should heed, the headmistress Linda Mikels so. 
This base attaches value to the almost exclusive application of the English language in the compartment-instruction. 
Woman Mikels, who refuses the idea of bilingual education, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a student, who had come before it from Mexico first shortly. 12 months later they would enter the class-area and can recognize him/it no longer. 
Worked ", she/it remarked, " it works for us ". 
Would Obama take a school like the " Sixth Street Prep " as model for other schools with big share in Latin American and other English learning students? 
The performances of the school would do the answer on this question easy, however the educational-political positions within his/its own party, the national Bildunsgvereinigungens support the idea of bilingual education for a long time, and forecasts do his/its own consistent support of the bilingual education over Obamas answer doubtfully. 
While he/it agrees to the point, that Immigrant Englisch should learn, he/it has trivialized the topic recently in that he/it remarked that people should stop, have worries about the legislation aiming on " only English ". 
Stattdessen, he/it said: It should guarantee " her/it/them that your child Spanish can ". 
If Obama wants actually to close the performance-distance, he/it should take educational-models, who work, instead of despising her/it/them into account carefully and, to trivialize.
