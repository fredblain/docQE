The accusations of the bar of the anti-Mafia-authority Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his/its replacement Rosario Schiavone of the community Gioia Tauro, that was arrested morning because of entanglement in Mafia-businesses today, is serious. 
In handcuffs was taken also Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, just as his nephew: the lawyer, which carries the same name like the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for entanglement into criminal unions of the Mafia, at that time to a compensation-sum of 10 millions Euro. 
So the lawyers write disregarding " " each type of moral and legal norm, the two local administrations had decided, the lawyer, to pay " Piromalli moneys for advice-activities. 
" Consequently, it had been made possible for the Mafia-group? according to the judges? in official way to penetrate into the town halls and to have a say " the politics of the public administration.

The judges explain in the context with the warrant of today morning however that the Piromalli-Clan had even dared to apply for an alteration of the A3-Projektes. 
From an Abhöraktion in the context with the examinations to the case Dal Torrione, the willingness has appeared to come towards the wishes of an entrepreneur that a representative of the big group is about the Piromalli as is known ? wodurch the measures of the public administration identically with the interests this clan became ".
