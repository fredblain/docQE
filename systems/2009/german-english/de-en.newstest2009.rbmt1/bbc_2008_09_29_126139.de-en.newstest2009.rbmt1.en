BskyB loses complaint in the case ITV 
BskyB has his/its complaint against the decision of the competition-commission, his/its share at the the competing station ITV, to reduce, lost. 
The competition-court of appeals has prescribed BskyB to reduce his/its participation at ITV of 17.9% on under 7.5%. 
Before the commission had claimed, the share of BskyBs distorts the competition and makes possible an unlauteren influence for him/it on the station ITV. 
BskyB has acquired his/its share in the year 2006, in that he/it NTL, renamed now into Virgin media, successfully at the purchase of ITV has hindered. 
In April 2007, the competition-authority has reported, the purchase of the share at ITV through BskyB ready doubts at the independence of the ITV, what the competition-commission persuades to it to start an examination has. 
The Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer-groups and that communication-velvet Ofcom has been pronounced against the purchase. 
BskyB argued, the pressure to reduce his/its share in ITV is an unreasonable and exaggerated measure especially because BskyB had announced to want to give up his/its rights to vote.
