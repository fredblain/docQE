Obama? the first anti-American president? Here an explanation 
A known American politician, whom much cares about it, than to be looked at independently, has written: " Barack Obama becomes the second anti-american president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, that through his/its decisions, the economy of the USA decimated and that looked after relationships with the hostile to Islam and this still today as private-man toots." 
The attacks against Obama become ever more vehement, exactly now, where the elections approach. 
A lady from Miami has written in an Internet side: " This person is full ambitions. 
Obama is very fresh: he/it thinks he/it is gotten the highest office of a nation, the altogether two black governor and five black senators has seen!. 
Actually, these attacks have not much to say however; it is about racist attacks and she/it doesn't answer the question of the voters: will he/it be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; all it says that Obama will win with a big start. 
Also in this case, people are there, that with him/it heart and speaks not with the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the united states, has in her/its/their in the Editorial written: we will probably know only in the voting booth to whom the real American patriot will give his/its voice. 
A mentality of the USA to the light, that hides up to last, comes become hold here. 
" Say, what you want, then we will adjudicate for whom we will do our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain ". 
People, that swear, are there: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
Something, which they heard never before? only now, where the success of the black so certainly seems candidate. 
By all means, despite all of these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 persons were questioned: Which mistakes has Bush committed during his/its term of office? 89% have answered: the war in the Iraq. 
America changes. 
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent with a step into the rear end again home. 
In the Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost her/its/their life and the Americans were not forced to pack. 
Nevertheless, the Iraq remains the weak-point of Bush for the majority. 
The one, that will occupy his/its position, is faced with a gigantic task.
