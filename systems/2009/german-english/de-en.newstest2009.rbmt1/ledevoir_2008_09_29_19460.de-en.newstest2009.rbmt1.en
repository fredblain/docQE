Letters - in dishonored country 
Mr. Vic Toews, ex - ' Justiz'-Minister, which irony, in the cabinet of Harper, it, that afforded itself to say about Louise Arbour last summers, be she/it a `Schande ' for Canada. 
This woman, who doesn't finish one, wanting fight for the justice has led and all our admiration deserves to cover with humiliation so, just as much says about the persons about the premier around, as over Stephen parkers themselves. 
We have to do with a government, that have not gotten their countryman caught in the concentration-camp Guantanamo as single from all the concerned countries home, here. 
A government, that takes into account not once, that Omar Khadr was another teenager, as the things, that are accused him/it, happened. 
The only government, that despite the fact, that Canada has signed the Genevan convention, her/its/their word breaks and lets a Kindersoldat waste away under inhuman conditions. 
The single, that condescends to a justice-parody in order to assess the blame of the defendant. 
Let's call us in memory that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the union of the Canadian lawyers plead for it above all to get Omar Khadr home so that he/it receives a just process in Canada. 
Exactly this government locks also the eyes before the torture: It interests her/it/them little that surely a young grown-up after so many years of the pain for always emotionally broken will be. 
We are ourselves his not yet consciously, but we experience exactly a malignant trimming our right, our freedom and our `Demokratie here ', this word, that carries Harper like a flag before itself constantly, and that from his/its mouth so meaningless sounds. 
The time, that there is no morals more, has therefore come: One can abuse a Canadian citizen arbitrarily, tortures and locks up, completely after discretion of a government head that is supported until today only from the minority, he/it likes after the 14. Octobers completely to the minority belongs...). 
Many voters believe to find her/its/their salvation with a party, the virtue, law and order preaches. But they don't see that this government has dissociated herself/itself from that, which amounted the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere different.
