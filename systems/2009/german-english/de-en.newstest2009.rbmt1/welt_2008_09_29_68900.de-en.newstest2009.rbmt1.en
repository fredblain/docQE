Dark matter influences flight of area-probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon provides helplessness when searching: Dark matter influences the speed of area-probes during so named Swing-by-Man√∂ver. 
Experts are afraid that Albert Einsteins general relativity-theory could not be quite right. 
Almost 18 years, the area-probe " flew Ulysses " through the space. 
Because of fuel-managements freezing soon, you now threaten the hypothermia. 
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon provides bewilderment for years - the Swing-by-Anomalie. 
The Swing-by is a flight-maneuver of area-probes, with which they get additional energy in the gravitational-field of a heavenly body, approximately the earth. 
The probes can save much fuel through it. 
The European-American research-probe of Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick like the sunbathe-probe Ulysses as well. 
What astonishes the researchers with it however already for years: The missiles don't behave 100-percent so as they would expect it according to the time-honored gravitational-law. 
Rather, irregularities occur in the speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly more quickly or slow. 
Up to now, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
You/they baptized him/it Swing-by-Anomalie. 
Some experts are afraid that possibly even Albert Einsteins general relativity-theory, that describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of the area, could not be quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the institute for Advanced Study from Princeton it still believes solidly that Einstein didn't wander, and tries to explain the Swing-by-Anomalie with the help of the so-called dark matter, the astronomers in the universe has amounted. 
" Responsibly for the anomaly, dark matter, that could also be completely near the earth, could be he/it writes. 
About the existence of the dark matter, the space-researchers have known only for approximately ten years. 
An attraction, whose effect has observed itself on other heavenly bodies, assumes her/it/them obviously. 
She/it itself is however completely invisible, that is, she/it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially just also no visible light. 
After the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter amounts after all well one fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
