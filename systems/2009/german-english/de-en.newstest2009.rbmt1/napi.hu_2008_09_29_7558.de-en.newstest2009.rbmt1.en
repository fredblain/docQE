A name for the sündteure child 
The written version of the 700-bil-dollar of heavy Rettungspaket-Gesetzes, that will be to be applied in several stages and aims on the purchase of the bad credits of the banks, is now available. 
In the first passageway, half of the money should be passed out. 
In a session, that came local time East coast on Saturday after midnight to an end, the congresspersons have themselves after several days' debates to an unification over the 700-Milliarden-Dollar severe rescue-packet durchgerungen, Reuters reported. 
" We have achieved " essential advances, Nancy Pelosi said, democratic president in the American deputy-house, and thought, one must only write down the unification. 
The achieved compromise over the rescue-package backed both presidency-candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Finance-minister Henry Paulson thought to the result: The program will show effect and it becomes efficient, one must do even more however. Loudly Pelosi was not it here about the rescue the embankment Street but about it, the rudder of the economy rumzureißen. 
The written setting of the package still became before the opening of the Asian markets, therefore, Washingtoner time Sunday evening 8 o'clock, Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning, publishes, has caused no height-flight on the stock exchanges however. 
On Monday, the deputy-house first votes on the bill to the stabilization of the economy of 2008, the senate is next then. 
President George W. Bush spoke on the Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also that white house greeted the news over the unification. 
We are content with the advances achieved in the night and estimate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, Tony Fratto said, speakers of the white house. 
The program deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush-administration however, after which the 700 bil. Dollar all at once for the purchase lazy, with credits of incriminated investments should be spent. 
In a first tranche, half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages should be passed out at most, with what 250 bil. it is immediately available after the congress will vote on Monday on the Causa as expected. This sum should be used for the purchase of credit-incriminated, bad investments, and over the further 100 bil. USD should adjudicate the president. 
The program is checked by an individual commission, that also the president of the Federal reserve belongs. 
The other half the 700 bil. depend on another decision of the congress. 
In the sense of the law, the department of Finance can apply also a combined tactic: It can bad credits, mortgages, simultaneously and incriminated investments buy with mortgages, or also other " poisonous " credits. 
How responsible persons of the ministry reported, the purchase can as well as in an auction, as also takes place directly. 
The law makes possible it for the concerned companies to take part in an insurance-program, with which the department of Finance guarantees the worrying methods, and pays the businesses to the too expectant damages corresponding dues. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary methods so that up to 700 bil. Dollar as immediately-help for the American financial system to the disposal can be put, be it for the big aimed purchase of bad methods, her/its/their insurance, or the avoidance of a system-risk, that is caused by the collapse of a bigger money-institute. 
We put down the necessary steps so that we are ready to the introduction of the law as soon as it was signed, according to Paulson. 
The bosses of that in difficulties gotten and now on state help dependent banks can calculate with it however that her/its/their dispatches, that are named Golden Handshake ", from which government is shortened, in the overseas-slang careless ". 
There will be a shortening of the salaries only in certain cases, and these shortenings will depend on it as the department of Finance helps out in each case. 
The shortening essentially means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, according to the " Golden Handshake " is taxed, unless, the finished Bankenchef is pushed into the pension. 
The government will intervene aggressively in the case of a direct purchase of the lazy credits in order to guarantee that the manager-salaries are not exaggerated. 
To the picture, it also belongs that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträges are not altered - the restrictions it refers only to new agreements so that umsos take part more people in the program. 
That is the first case in the American history, that shortenings are regulated with manager-salaries per law, the Democrat Barney wrote a commentary on Frank, chairperson of the finance-committee, the measure. 
The state gains participation-rights the participating banks, sodass the risk for the taxpayers it sinks since they can also participate, as soon as it the economy and with it also the rescued bank again better goes. 
The bill intends that the president must present a suggestion to the congress in the next five years as the taxpayers should get back her/its/their lost money from the finance-sector again. 
There were skeptics, that have expressed her/its/their doubts in reference to the plan, for both sides however. 
That is not that, which the American citizens of us expect, the plan the money of the taxpayers protects on no account, according to the Californian Republican Darrell Issa. 
His/its colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur thought: The measures were advanced by the same persons, who are responsible the embankment also for the collapse Street.
