CSU: Mercy on time 
End of Octobers is decided on the fate of the fallen duet of Huber-Beckstein 
No heads still roll despite the election-debacle in the meantime, the personnel-debates were adjourned at the top of the Bavarian CSU. 
Still remains party-boss Erwin Huber and prime minister Beckstein in her/its/their offices, the question is only how long this mercy lasts. 
On the fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17-percent Stimmverlust, one decides at the last October-weekend with the extraordinary convention. 
The much scolded duet let however already understand that it would not like to stick on her/its/their chairs. 
They want to calm down the displeased parliamentary party and the party-basis, that demanded personal consequences a day after the " Bavarian Tsunami " in view of the loss of the absolute majority, with it. 
Five years ago - admitted, under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber standing at his/its career-climax - still reached the Christian-social union 60,7 percent. Now however, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, they could secure only 43,4 percent of the votes. 
The CSU was Alleinregierer " 46 years long " in Bavaria, that obtains 18 percent of the German BIP. 
The conservatives admittedly remain the decisive strength in the southern state important also for the Hungarian economy, will have to reign in a coalition however henceforth. 
As first sign of the internal party restructurings, Seehofer is tied in the potenzielle successor Hubers, vice-president and Federal-agrarian-minister Horst also into the reconnaissance-team, that with the liberal FDP, respectively the right-wing " wooing Voter " Sondierungsgespräche over a possible Munich coalition leads. 
It equals an irony of the fate that voter " comes in with the list " outside that Gabriele Pauli into the legislature whose Anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duet first has ausgenützt, about then the purposeful politician unmerciful to abservieren. 
The CSU-leadership now concentrates all her/its/their strengths on the stabilization Becksteins. 
In this transition-process, Stoiber, that pulled the threads out of the background up to now, will come an active role. Named the 28 the former prime minister and CSU-chairperson. September the " most bitter day of his/its political career ". 
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks in direction CDU - according to his/its opinion would have earned the CSU much more support of the sister-party. 
Other CSU-politician interpreted the defeat as a signal at the CDU and with it also at Angela Merkel. 
If the CSU, that has contributed much to the success 2005 also on national level, should not be put with a common strength-act on the legs again, Merkel cannot become a chancellor after the Bundestag-elections in September 2009 again. 
Merkel, that has done no secret from her/its/their disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the terrain-loss of the CSU won't have an effect negatively on the big coalition in Berlin. 
What is however relative: The injured CSU won't be easier to reign, and the crisis of the social democrats continues meanwhile. 
With 18,6 percent, the SPD reached her/it/them best result in Bavaria since 1946 up to now.
