If the energy originates from from the waves, the big accumulate suddenly 
It is a not drying up money-source which covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seems this, to comprehend the big energy-companies of the world. 
Waves, currents and tideses are now the new renewable sources of energy on them/her/it all looks, and also to occupy seeks, approximately giants like Chevron. 
The possibility to win energy from the movements of the sea has already been moved for 70 years in consideration and has been examined; not by chance intensified itself these studies since the first petroleum-crisis considerably. 
As the price of the oil broke in about 1980, one gass the idea of the Meeresenergie, now however the environment-organizations and the climbed Ã–lpreis press for new impulses in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world-wide energy needs of the energies generated through the ocean-waves could be covered. 
This would equal the double of that through nuclear power plants of produced energy momentarily. 
To it, the currents and tideses would furthermore still come. 
Giants with the attack. 
The first company, that now favors the Meeresenergie, is Enersis, that has signed a contract in the year 2005 to the erection of a power plant in the north of Portugal. 
As this message was published it seemed to be about a revolutionary step. 
Two years later, it is now companies from the traditional energy-industry, that puts energy-extraction on the navy, more and more. 
" Chevron examines these technologies "? according to the speaker a the US-American giant of known business in the embankment Street journal? and weigh up the possibility to work together " with us. 
It is about the procurement of an admission of the American energy-commission, that is necessary, on this occasion in order to start a project before the coast of Alaska. 
This is a not too underestimating sign, V. A. if one considers, that oil is still promoted exactly in Alaska through the USA and President Bush put down the plans first for new Bohrungen in walk recently. 
Besides Chevron, also the companies Verdant power Inc. are power from New Jersey, that invests into the new industry, from New York and Ocean; is not known also the details, so observers speak of a climbing interest however. 
Still improvement-worthy technologies. 
Experts still speak themselves of one in the departure deciding technology, this not finally, since the last doubts of sides of the environmentalists are not yet clarified. 
Until now, projects are like that in Portugal and also Scotland of rather small dimension and seems no to cause seriously to taking ecological problems. 
In order to produce however energy in big standard, it needs technologies with much bigger influence on the environment. 
There are different possibilities: Ocean power for example uses a system of together interconnected buoys. 
The thrust of the waves, which the buoys on and moves down, is changed within the swimmers over pistons and cylinders in hydraulic pressure. 
This drives a turbine, which drives a generator on the other hand. 
The stream is sent to it over underwater-managements to the coast. 
So far, there is four schemed enclosures of this type, which only wait for the state authorization. A part of the won energy could serve also for military facilities. 
Verdant power already produces energy for a merchandise-department store and a park-bib with the help of submarine turbines in the east River of New York meanwhile. 
The water-movements during the tideses drives the turbines, which eat the generator through the emerging rotation. 
Loudly Verdant waits already to use a long snake of possible clients on the necessary Autorisierungens about these sources of energy. 
First the waves, then the tideses. 
A particular interest deserved according to the institute for stream-extraction-research momentarily the Potenzial, which is in the tideses. 
Albeit it is also about an irregular phenomenon, the tideses are vorhersagbars as wind-currents, the sun-no-radiation and also the waves, however better and therefore a more trustworthy stream-source. 
Exactly the tides-energy is it, which federal states like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as wide coastal-states to it already to invest 7,5 million dollars in the year 2008 brought? is already planned for 2009 up to 35 millions.
