Duel on knife's edge: MP3-Player against Handys. 
We discuss you with your election 
While each Handy MP3-Dateien can almost play, no MP3-Player can still telephone. 
Therefore it looks of course so that it is better, itself only one telephone, to buy. 
Despite all, there are reasons for it sufficiently why they should get itself an autonomous Player. 
The election depends the prospective proprietor on the type of the utilization and the claims completely. 
Certainly, one hardly buys itself for at home a great expensive record player in order to be able to tell by the sound the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc of itself on it. 
First such musical newness don't appear on LPs, and from qualitative view, there is also no objective reason for it. 
Have LPs with type skirt, jazz or blues in the shelf however, you dream of a such probably at least. 
So, that is also expressed simplified with the music on trips, therefore with compressed music, - music in the MP3-Format. 
Also here, there are price - and quality-categories. 
For the one, it is not acceptable maybe to pass out eight-thousand crowns for a Player, as well a Pink-Floyd-Fan will probably come to terms with headphones for twenty crowns of the market hardly however. 
Two extremes, between which there is area for any enough. 
The selection is gefächert broadly. 
Also the lifespan of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good Music Player can play much more than only music, but they manage that, which Handyses can, not once in passing. 
No modern appliance is as universal as the telephone to start. 
Beside the primary functions, telephoning and him/it ledges, it can return music and videos, both lifts, it has a better once, once a worse camera and can maybe also navigate. 
And if one still includes the Smartphons and communicators, one has almost one small computers in the bag. 
It is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and can photograph no TV. 
However the universality of the Handys entails also disadvantages. 
The more functions use you on your Handy, the more frequently you will reload it must. 
And one of the biggest energy-gluttons is the pass of music. 
Only few Handyses can play music longer than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much fewer. 
In this sense, Music Player (specifically the simplest) are clearly more efficient. 
Therefore you should reckon with the cheap Handyses with it that they cannot play music longer than a few hours. 
If then you from and at still telephones, you rather buy yourself/themselves another charger for the office to the security - that is valid appliance also for teurere. 
With MP3-Playern, you won't have this problem, also the less good endure nonstop business at least 9 hours with a time loading. 
Another problem exists then if one wants to cover up the music on the Handy. 
Unfortunately only an inferior part of the appliances owns an USB-Abschluss, furthermore each Handy cannot be connected directly without particular software to a PC. 
Of course one can cover up the music on a storage-medium directly, however only few fix-reading-appliances get done without reduction with the tiny storage-cards, that use in Handys, becomes. 
With Playern, you require no particular software until on exceptions (iPod). 
You/they need to feed the appliance only over USB-Port with music from your PC. 
Most Handys and Player position even a music-library, arranged after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or for example the evaluation through users. 
Some appliances portray only the tree-structure of the Adressverzeichnisses, like like the Windows Explorer, some can both, iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowons, intelligent telephones with operating system. 
Player are easier to serve, Handyses can more 
With the selection of a concrete appliance, you should especially inquire about the lifespan of the accumulator, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also the Bedienkomfort. 
Music is scenery for you above all and hears you she/it every day in the streetcar only shortly for example, an any Handy, that plays MP3-Dateien, is enough then. 
What each Handy truly already almost can. 
You/they must not also control particularly which music-formats a Handy or a Player can process. 
MP3S manage all, and the most music, that you receive, will be exactly in this format. 
The format hears spread to that the most, and furthermore most appliances can play also music in the WMA-Format. 
AAC, a format, that uses Apple and his/its iPods, is less usual. 
Better Handyses also make possible the purchase of music online. 
One needs the corresponding sides of a Providers or another supplier only over mobile Internet to call, and already one can acquire a song or album. 
This service already can at and for itself a beating argument for it why they should get itself a Musikhandy is. 
Unfortunately the offer of the Provider is badly and restricts itself mostly only to fast radio-hits. 
The prices are not the lowest either. 
Generally however, one assumes it that exactly this type of the sale of music, be it over GSM, Internet or wireless Internet, will master the music-industry in future. 
Most carry the Handy on itself. 
If you have desire to be able to tell by the sound itself/themselves of something, you reach after the Handy into the jacket-bag, during which Player forget, at home lies. 
It depends on it however whether you also carry headphones or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung on itself always. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker, that each Handy almost owns, but only the fewest MP3-Players. 
The probably biggest advantage of the Musikhandys will lie for many in the price. 
The cheapest normally cost less than three-thousand crowns. 
For three - and four-thousand crowns already receive you a quite decent Walkman. 
The biggest Handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are with it. 
The best and technically ripest telephones with one 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphones costs up to fifteen-thousand crowns. 
The advantage of the Player lies in the easy service on the other hand. 
The simplest - and not absolutely cheapest, sees selection, - Player can really serve everyone. 
A minimum at functions, the similarity with the service with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or for example the record player is obvious. 
No collision threatens in form of an erroneously employed mobile Internets and an afterwards horrenden bill for data-transfers. 
They should now reach for which appliance 
Also the cheapest Handyses, for example Vodafone 527, own slot for exchangeable storage-media, type M2, microSD and Ä. one normally. 
Even if a corresponding fixes you nachkaufen, two thousand crowns are enough. 
However respect. 
With the basis-models, normally only cards are supported with a maximum capacity of 2 GBS. 
Only the most expensive can read also 8-GB-Speicherkarten. 
If you already possess a Handy and want to buy itself another affordable MP3-Player, then you reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity (maximum 2 GBS) must put you the table then no longer than 1100 crowns on. 
Belong to the more selective listeners, you take rather specialized Handys - Walkmans, Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung. 
These appliances have autonomous Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and the Bedienkomfort gets him/it of one single MP3-Players so. 
Sony Ericsson, his Handys has Walkman the same user-interface from the series, is the widest here like the individually sold MP3-Players. 
The same services in the same price-category from up to four-thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GBS) and a long accumulator-lifespan, normally 15 hours, at most up to 35 hours, MP3-Players achieve you the producer mentioned above.
