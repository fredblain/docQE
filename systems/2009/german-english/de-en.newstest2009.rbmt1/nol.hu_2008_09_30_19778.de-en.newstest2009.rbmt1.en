Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0 
With the elections on Sunday, no deputy of the opposition has made it into the Ukrainian parliament. 
Thinks Russian observers, this is because of the affluence and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko that OECD suspects however illegalities with the count of the votes. 
The OECD, that has sent out 450 observers from 43 countries, has not acknowledged the elections. 
De legislature of the 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates admittedly makes do since decades without opposition. Nevertheless that has hoped itself them/her/it under the name " united democratic strengths " (ODS) of gathered opposing side before the previous elections seriously that Lukaschenko, that already renewed his/its presidency-mandate for the fourth time with the unclean elections and thanks to an amendment 2006, would admit " some deputy of the opposition in the parliament " this time. 
Therefore, the ODS has even taken distance from the boycotts planned before. 
The Ukraine becomes economically ever more dependent thanks to the climbing prices with the natural gas-import from Russia. For the relief of the price-increases, even credits were lifted, and the country has agreed also to the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the Gaspipeline leading through the country, at the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition, the hope therefore stood, the Ukraine wants to improve her/its/their relationship with the EC, after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians because of the as anti-democratically classified political system in the EC entry-prohibition has. 
The evaluation-report of the elections of the OECD provided a momentary relaxation, in which sooner the emphasis on the positive movements, instead of on the lacks - like approximately the exclusion one third of the opposition-candidates of the elections - lay. 
However, the quickly-report of the OECD already criticized the campaign on Monday - therefore should not occur opposition in the press - and especially the fact, that the opposition was allowed to be not present with the count of the votes. 
Despite all that, the opposition is able an improvement in the political system recognizes: Political prisoners became approximately sedate on free foot, and Minsk is even ready to smaller confrontations with Moscow in that it still refuses the acknowledgment of the independence of the apostate georgischen provinces South-Ossetia and Abchasien although Russia, with which the Ukraine forms a federal-state on the paper, has considered the two areas for one month independent. 
" We have two steps onward and done one backwards, but the most important is, that the dialogue has begun between Weißrussland and the EC, Alexander Milinkewitsch said to our leaf. 
In the opinion of the opposition-candidate of the presidency-elections of 2006, a continuation is desirable, although " has received the heroic anxiety to let " also only an opposition into the parliament. 
The opposition plans no protest-measures in view of the results but tries the necessity of an economic-reform the voters sooner clear-shuts. 
" We have to fight with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us with the distribution stones into the way, but nevertheless I see that people support the change more and more, even the older " - said Milinkewitsch in allusion to it, that not once the most-backed layer of the pensioners agrees with the Lukaschenko-Regime, his single merit is the manufacture of social security. 
" Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of the trade deficit, it is a question of the time merely, until begins " to crumble the social security " reminding " at the silence of a graveyard, according to Milinkewitsch. 
In contrast to the opposition-politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic. 
Sergej Lebedev, leader of the mission of the community of independent states explained Ria Novosti to the news agency: " The people believe the actions, and not the words ". The absence of the opposition is therefore a proof for the maturity of the weißrussischen voters.
