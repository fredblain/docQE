Before one pair of days, you have appeared on the Laufstieg with Naomi Campbell, is that correct? 
Is good, something similar doesn't say. 
It is not so that I was on the Laufstieg in order to model. 
Naomi Campbell, that I since knows some time, has simply called me and to London has invited, about at a parade for the charity-event of her/its/their organization `Frauen for a better Welt' and the clothing, that we show, to participate. I know that two garments were auctioned from our collection for mango in order to collect the money for Naomis NGO. 
The people don't know Naomis good heart. 
Many matters are told about her/it/them. I, as the one, that she/it knows, would tell you, that they are not correct. 
Nevertheless, I will support this good matter, at which she/it is involved. 
She/it asked me to take part in the parade for this generous matter, but if she/it comes and asks me to do a handstand, I will do also that. 
, In order to support the women world in the third, whatever necessary is.
