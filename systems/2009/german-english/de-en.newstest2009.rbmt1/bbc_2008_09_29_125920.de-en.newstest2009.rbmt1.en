Official responsible for lost data is accused 
The BBC has experienced that the cabinet-official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be accused in accordance with the " public security-law ". 
The man was delegated from the ministry of defense as he/it lost two extremely confidential documents in a train after Waterloo. 
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police. 
It is the weakest accusation within the law and there is no indication for criminal intent. 
BBC defense-correspondent Frank Gardner said the action has been a surprise for many in Whitehall. 
He/it said: " You/they would have thought that would be quarreled internally with it at the ministry of defense and cabinet. 
The employee, his names cannot be named, is accused in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause, that deals with the certain storage of information. 
The royal public prosecutor's office recommended that the official should be accused by the Metropolitan police of the extremely sensitive nature of his/its work in the common Geheimdienstkommitee. 
The documents, that he/it transferred, contained classified evaluations over Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces. 
He/it was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his/its house at a secretly held place.
