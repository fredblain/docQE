In Mexico and without `peep-toes ' 
With British punctuality, at 17:40 o'clock, about the time, that was intended by the program, beside which presidential-hangars of the airport landed Benito Juárez de México DF, the airplane of the Spanish air force, with which prince and princess of Asturien traveled. 
The sun went down, but her/its/their rays have still forced to use the hand as parasol, about the royal pair, which got out of the airplane, to see. 
Directly at the ramp: the more Spanish messenger and other authorities 
One pair of hours before it, I had asked a taxi-driver on the street whether he/it knew that the prince and the princess of Asturien visited the city in order to formalize the official trip. 
- Ah, very good, therefore, there one can be no people of mitnehmenSie at the airport about this time from hieroder
No, she/it is the Spaniard, but she/it has lived one pair of year here. 
-Ach so, very well
But the Mexican press knows quite exactly whoever are the prince and the princess of Asturien and know the importance of the trip. 
It is also military-protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, that honorary-volley hands over, many, that wait in the hangar of the airport and at the red carpet. 
The prince appears smiling, dresses in navy blue, and she/it, the princess, with long from the wind blown hair, without usual `peep-toes ', was communicated her/it/them maybe, that a thunderstorm is expected in DF. 
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official retinue waits. 
At the door of the hotel in which they are accommodated, one of the four biggest in the city, a reporter of the Mexican television, who likes to do jokes, waits for her/it/them.
