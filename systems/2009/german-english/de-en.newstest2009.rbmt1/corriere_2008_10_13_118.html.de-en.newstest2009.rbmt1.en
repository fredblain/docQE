The super-glue, that lets rise at walls, 
, To defeat the strengths of the gravity thanks to a glue, and walls, to be able to high-climb, like Superman. 
This is the object of four American research-centers, from which a now seemingly almost at the goal has arrived. 
With a glue found on a surface of only 2,5 qcms, the researchers have succeeded with it, a 100 kg severe flesh, to fix on a vertical wall. 
That STUDIO? an American magazine has, institutes have the results of the researchers of the university of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia of Technology and Force Research Laboratory publishes the aura. 
The material fictional from the researcher-team is a development the glue used already, which a special carbon-structure, named Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, uses. 
One can imagine " " the principle of the glue like a row to a stack spaghetti angeordneter tubes, Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia explains of Technology to institute in Atlanta. 
The scientists could be inspired from that feet of the Geckos, which are covered from microscopic Härchen, that gives the animal a perfect hold. 
The tests enforced with different materials like glass of teflon and Schleifpapier have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger, as the hold-ability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time " easily from the wall, according to Liming Dai, has " removed researchers of the faculty for engineerings of the university of Dayton. 
AT WALLS ENTLANGWANDERN? " This material could be put in as transient glue, Liming Dai adds. 
, In order to upwards-go approximately like Spiderman at walls? Maybe already, however the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, like approximately the connection of electric appliances, sooner because the Nanoröhrchens are leaders of heat and electricity as well. 
Wide application-areas could fall into the area of the space travel. 
The super-heroes must therefore still wait for the moment. 
THE OTHER TYPE OF THE RESEARCH? also the university of Berkeley, California, devotes itself to a new glue-type. 
In an article of the American Chemical high society, the Californian scientists present a glue from micro-fibers that itself like hair through movement on a surface itself of the dust cleans and always protects a perfect liability through it.
