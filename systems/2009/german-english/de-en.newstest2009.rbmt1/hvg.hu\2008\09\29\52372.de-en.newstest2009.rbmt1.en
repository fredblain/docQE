What became produced &amp into the bill-factory of surcharge; Co.? 
At the 8. Octobers begin the negotiations in the criminal-process against János surcharge and his/its accomplices. 
The participation especially becomes the defendants at the organized crime, just as roughly negligent damage and business-deceit, and other punishable actions - among other things Dokumentenfälschung - accused. 
That were used loudly public prosecutor's office from the announcements lukrierten methods for own purposes, during the produced performances often with phony bills was covered. 
State moneys and subsidies of the self-administration - altogether HOOF 65 million - partly shall Fiatal Baloldal into the cash registers of the organization, partly into the private-cash registers individual has flowed. 
How the investigation-authorities gave known, fictitious bills were submitted when covering the announcement-moneys, and the clubs should not have complied with her/its/their duties either. 
A bulk of the bills should have been falsified loudly indictment. 
The bill-blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, they had the round-seals prepared in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision over it, on which companies the bills should be displayed, was adjudicated on that tour from the flatten-lake north on which István Lados of János surcharge was sent. 
In the course of this " reconnaissance-tour " should do Lados pensions and restaurants available. 
He/it demanded bills over the Konsumationen, about later on these presentations based bills for the youth - and sport-ministry, the socially - and department of labor, just as to be able to display the self-administration of Budapest. 
These bills shall of the majority from István Lados and his/its accomplice, András ?ri, with which should have been responsible more final after our information for the constitution of the corresponding reports, has been manipulated. 
A beer-pub was one of the goals of Lados' " reconnaissance-tour ". 
How is to be taken displayed bills in the year 2003 two of surcharge and Co, the gastronomy-business should have entertained the ninety-headed group of the club Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
Now the boss of the business declares however, a so big group was not open in-fited into the pub. 
Another bill, displayed in the summer 2002 on the foundation work Jöv?ért, later known as Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért, also serious form - and content-mistake showed. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, that decrees over three rooms merely and can lodge simultaneously no longer than ten persons, 130 guests should have been according to bill. 
Within no limits were kept the make-believe of the bill-forgers apparently as well, as it about the Pigal Kft. went, a gastronomy-business, in his bookkeeping records of the customers not at all appear work Jöv?ért and Hoppá according to prosecution first. 
How manager Gy?z? Farkas of the hvg.hu told, was immediately clear to him/it that it was about phony documents as records were submitted him/it by the public prosecutor's office during an examination. 
" Our company name and the tax-number were incorrectly installed " on the stamp. 
And further: Apart from irregularities also the fact was wrong that the business should have lodged einhundert persons after they have altogether eleven rooms, that so many persons offer place impossibly. 
Also food has been quoted on the bill, the restaurant is time with it in business no longer for a long time. 
The industrious bill-forgers have also neglected to check, that the Budapester travel agency taken by them into the visor offers exclusively trips into the foreign countries, and so they have declared Hungary-trips on the cash payment-bill what of the Rechnungslegungspraxis of the company also contradicted. 
Like in the course of the investigations known became, they have quoted also the value added tax on the bills in addition although travel agency-performances, that refer to a country outside the EC, are value added tax-free. 
The height of the value added tax was altogether on four of the hotel Révfülöp Kft. at the foundation work Jöv?ért displayed bills wrong, since the business settles only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, furthermore exclusively mechanical bills are displayed by the co-workers, the phony documents were handwritten however. 
Another mistake, that the " Rechnungslegerns " were suffused, was that, that they had declared in a case " merchandise-transportation " as produced performance, although this of the company specialized on investment-advice is not offered, the public prosecutor's office told. 
Further irregularities - wrong bill-format, wrong stamp - was to be owed that that at Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, just as at XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont displayed bills as forgeries could be exposed. 
As well in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sport-camp Kunfehértó, whose managers declared, never to have displayed the bills. 
Another " mistake " is the forgers with the HIB Kft. happen from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001) namely exactly in dissolution, as the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület there should have eaten - the mass-administrator declared consequently even to have not displayed the bills. 
Falsified consciously 
Persons are the other group of the Rechnungsleger that was absolutely conscious, that they had to would put fictitious bills. 
On requests of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták has the foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the foundation Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért, in a height of approximately HOOF 4 million displayed. 
Loudly indictment became the manager of the Collab Kft. from one of the defendant, Ludovic Györfi, to the showing of the fictitious bills persuaded. 
That momentarily also in liquidation situated Biogate Kft. shall also with surcharge and Co. has worked together: In the year 2003, that shall Ltd. the foundation work Jöv?ért Alapítvány, just as the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny? Egyesület with phony bills in the total-value of HOOF 5 million, that referred to produced not performances, has looked after. 
There was just as little payment however since the bills were canceled directly after her/its/their showing what the concerned forget in her/its/their records however to note has. 
The third group of the Rechnungsleger includes persons, who are brought directly with the defendants in connection. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the mailcarrier of the Ukrainian manager of that delta Trió Kft., one in Budapest resident, there however not findable fuel - and vehicle-commercial firm. 
This company should have displayed in the time period of October until December 2005 several bills over the sale of EDP-components in the total-value of HOOF approximately 18 million. 
Loudly investigation-authority shall them/her/it since the 14. September 2005 in liquidation situated Cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas as buyers of these bills has functioned. 
Manager this company was a Romanian, whom the Firmendokumentes should also be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
After our information, Kubatov has confessed during the investigations, bills in the name of that Ltd. at the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, just as displayed at Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their value itself. 
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. just as the Jos-Investment Bt. should have been established by Romanian masons on Iván Kubatovs express wish. 
In truth, no one of these companies was active however, something loud defendant about lacking jobs lay. 
Nevertheless, he/it could profit from the businesses: On requests of his/its accomplice, the lawyer's Zsolt Szente, that was engaged with the preparation of the Firmengründungsunterlagen, he/it has displayed bills at the clubs brought with surcharge in connection in the name of the companies, like approximately at Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Altogether, Kubatov shall 15 bills in the total-value of HOOF 14,2 million in the name of the companies Cash Investment, delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos investment and Linaxtrade at the organizations has displayed. 
The public prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the bill-sum as well as the value added tax in each case. 
Kubatov shall even the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the showing of fictitious bills has abused - in this case was enclosed the bills the applications of Biztos Pont. 
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért have her/its/their applications with the nonprofit organization of the socialistic party in January 2006, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA ") handed over. 
Both got per 500.000 Forints, these amounts have misused been of use. 
In order to hush up this, they have the TMA five fictitious bills the Works team Kft. submitted. 
These bills were guaranteed incidentally with the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the instruction-ministry. 
With the negotiations, it now becomes from some defendants with a confession over the procedure of the bill-forgery as they were already set aside before the public prosecutor's office, calculated. 
A sensation could be if the main-defendant decides János surcharge on an extensive confession. 
His/its previous statements were namely less elaborate, and although he/it had already promised several times to report inclusively on everything, his/its confession still endures. 
The question remains therefore open whether this lies in his/its interest whether the socialists have finished a pact with him/it respecting the recompense of the bulk of the originated damage of HOOF 50 million, and whether surcharge is as a countermove ready to adopt the responsibility. 
It is however absolutely possible that surcharge now plays the " offended " after his/its pleas had come upon mitigation of the imprisonment and house-arrest on numb ears. 
While other criminals that prepared much bigger damage with economic-offenses and this has not reimbursed, on free foot, or stands at least under house-arrest, surcharge remains denied this possibility.
