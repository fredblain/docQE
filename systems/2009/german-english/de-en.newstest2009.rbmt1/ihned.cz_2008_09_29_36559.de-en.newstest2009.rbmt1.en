The legislators hope that it is given a farewell in the next days. 
The law will however still experience some changes. 
The total certain to the help for the system should be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars shall as quickly as possibly ready is put, as President Bush demanded.

The department of Finance should lead this.

The government should negotiate new installments with mortgages, that she/it buys up, with what the goal exists to lower the monthly expenses for the debtors and it them, to enable, to keep her/its/their houses. 
Marek: Psychological help 
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main-economist of Patria Finance David of Marek, however the transposition becomes very difficult. 
" In fact therefore, because one doesn't know, through which mechanism and about which price the problematic assets are bought up. 
That will be for it decisively, as the finance-sector and the government apportion " the losses among each other, Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week. 
Whether now the plan or beginning of next week is given a farewell, is not crucial according to Mareks opinion. 
It is " much more important that the congresspersons agree on it to support the plan and that she/it him/it as fast as possibly gives a farewell. 
The psychological meaning of the agreement over it, that a dismissal occurs, the most important ", emphasized Marek, is in this moment.
