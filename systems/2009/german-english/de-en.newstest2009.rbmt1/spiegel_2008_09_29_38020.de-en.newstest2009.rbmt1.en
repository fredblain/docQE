Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a scrapes flees with danger, that is called that she/it feels also fear? 
The neuro-scientist Joseph LeDoux is confident: Also many animals have feelings. 
Only like could check one whether they feel the same, if she/it itself like like we holds back? 
In the Internetzeitschrift " Edge " becomes since publishes several years of contributions of famous scientists. 
MIRROR presented selected answers in a series on the question " something ONLINE, you consider true without being able to prove it? 
I believe that animals have sensations and other Bewusstseinszustände without I or someone could prove this until now otherwise where we can prove not once that other people have consciousness. 
But we can hope in this case at least since all human brains show the same reason-configuration. 
As soon as we turn however other species to us and questions of the feels or quite broadly the consciousness broaches, we enter rough terrain because the hardware doesn't agree. 
If a rat gets in danger, she/it toots the same as many other animals: She/it places herself/itself dead, escapes or attacks. 
People behave similarly. 
I don't believe in it however. 
Two aspects the brain-structure make it difficult, our subjective experiencing on that of animals too figurative. 
To the one, that almost always lock up with the human consciousness associated circuitries the lateral präfrontalen Cortex, because of his/its participation at the short-time-memory and at the Ausführungs - / control-functions. 
This wide region is much higher than with the remaining primates developed with the human being and seems fully to be missing with other creatures. 
At least with those aspects of our consciousness, that depend on the präfrontalen Cortex, under it the knowledge, whoever are we, and the ability too flat and, to adjudicate, reason therefore exists to the assumption that the human being even differs from the other primates. 
Another dramatic peculiarity should lie in the linguistic nature of the human being: Since a so big part is interconnected his experience with language, it is called often, the consciousness depends on it. 
In this case, they could exclude animals. 
However even if consciousness would not depend on language, this would influence it certain, sodass itself animal consciousness, probably very much from most of our Bewusstseins-zustände how it may also be obtained, would distinguish. 
Therefore it is heavy to determine as consciousness may look with other animals. 
If it itself, as something internal and subjective, neither measures still, because of the particular hardware, on the basis of our own experience has analyzed, so his/its exploration places us in front of big problems. 
Most of my implementations refer to the content of the conscious sees, however there is still another aspect of the consciousness beside it, the scientifically more simply accessible should be. 
They could examine the Bewusstseinsprozesse of animals regardless of her/its/their contents, and exactly that happens with studies over the short-time-memory of primates, especially at the example of the Visualisierung. 
However with this base, that Christof cook and Francis Crick pursued, one resorts rather on the neuralen correlate of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identically or also not. 
This base emphasizes interesting-proof also the meaning of the präfrontalen Cortex for the realization of the Visualisierung. 
What now emerges for the sensations? 
I attribute her/it/them to it that an emotional system is activated like the brain agreed the fear in one of his/its own activity. 
For what we call fear ", the mentale condition, in which we are, is therefore if the activity the in the brain of localized defense-system or their consequences (like physical reactions) RAM covers. 
So about sensations are taken a narrow view bound at the regions of the Cortex, the primates and especially the individual mark. 
Connected emerged fine gradations of the feels with the linguistic nature, because we differentiate with help the words and the grammar conditions and can categorize in order to attribute her/it/them also to others beside us. 
In contrast Antonio Damasio thinks for example that sensations follow from more primitive activities in the body-feeling-regions of the Cortex and the brain-trunk Jaak Pankseep, that concentrates on the brain-trunk however more, similarly. 
Since this network has not changed in the sprint of the human evolution very much, it could absolutely be involved sensations at gattungsübergreifenden. 
Purely theoretically I cannot disagree with him/it, it considers unverifiable however. 
Pankseep argues, what appears with rats and people like fear, feels probably also in both cases so: How however could one check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly? 
One scrape flees with danger whether also she/it feels fear? 
In my eyes, bare behavior-similarity can still prove no experience-equality. 
Admittedly, the neurale comparison helps: Rats and people have similar brain-trunks, scraping against it not even one brain. 
But the brain-trunk is responsible for sensations? 
And even if they could prove that for the human being: How wanted they to prove it with rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even scrape, who knows, sensations have. 
But I would not know as I should prove that. 
And because presumably fundamentally itself her/its/their sensations from that our it distinguishes since the human consciousness is founded on particular circuits and on language, I rather explore the emotional behavior as the emotional sensations of rats. 
Anyway advances wave here on the neuralen level provided one measures the same with rats and people. 
As I don't explore language and consciousness with rats, so also not sensations, I don't know however whether they exist. 
One may consider that short-sighted, but I come rather in front than to run continuous against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist.
