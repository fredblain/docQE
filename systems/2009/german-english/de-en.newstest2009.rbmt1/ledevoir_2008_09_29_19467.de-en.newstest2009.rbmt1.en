The administration Bush and the leading congresspersons, Republican and Democrats likewise, finally came to an unification over the most extensive economic-rescue-plan since the big depression of the 30er years yesterday. 
The new version of the plan over 700 billion U.S. dollars that should stop the finance-crisis, that jars them/her/it embankment Street already for months, must still be assumed from the two congress-chambers. 
The main-contents are: , To secure a better control of the deputy over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms, about the repayment of the started public moneys, new disposals, to dam about the number of that on the basis of houses impounded by payment-remains, just as the right to oversee the salaries, that are paid at the leading employees of the backed businesses. 
The American finance-secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the deputy-chamber Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republican, present with the negotiations, senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, some minutes after midnight, the good piece of news, after a two-day negotiation-marathon. 
`Wirs have made big advances in direction of an unification, that market-effectively his/its wird', the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson, explained. 
`Es happened to everything, about the real economy and the American people before the course-crisis at the embankment Street to sch√ºtzen', the Democrat explained. 
`Dies is the basic point: If we the doesn't do, the trauma, the chaos and the unrests become sein's in the daily life of the Americans enormously, the Republican Judd Gregg explained. 
The negotiations had accelerated during the last both hours, from fear before the effect, that would have had a renewed failure on the mood of the investors. 
The period, that had been arranged, was morning the market-opening today. 
The two American presidency-candidates, who took part in the negotiations first late, appeared the unification sooner than advocates without missing however to express her/its/their dissatisfaction over it that one must be met her/it/them with this extreme way. 
The democratic senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain disposals to the unification, above all such, that it should enable the owners to keep her/its/their houses, and such that the salaries of the leading employee involve the establishment escaped by the state. 
`Wenn one the taxpayers therefore, to take extraordinary measures on the basis of the irresponsibility of certain persons, asks, that is nothing, on which they could congratulate itself. 
But these measures are notwendig's, he/it explained on the American television-stations. 
As he/it was asked on another station, whether he/it will vote for the proposed plan, his/its republican opponent John McCain answered: `Ich would like to know the details first, but I hope it. 
`Die guiding principle, that I have read, [shows], that this is a matter, that we all will have to digest, and we will be able to make progress with her/it. 
The option to do nothing at all quite simply is not akzeptabel', he/it said. 
The 700 billion dollar-arrangement is organized on it, with the money of the taxpayers 
He/it comes 14 months after a crisis, through bursting of a real estate-blister caused that first led the high-risk hypo-bar-credit (Subprime) to the breakdown, before she/it widened on further forms of more dispersed bonds, PCAA, and led finally into a freezing up the finance-strength and into the ruin of the banks and money-institutes. 
A group republican deputy was it, let the last week fail the first attempt to the unification. 
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `giftige ' assets of the societies in distress only of the government secured and should not be bought, one believes itself from the dead end escaped. 
In order to round off the viewpoints for finished in the congress, one has added also a disposal, that means, that, if the government should do with this program within five years of losses, could raise her/it/them new taxes then, all the her/its/their started capital, to get back. 
The new plan intends the payment of a first sum of 250 billions, to which can 100 billions further to arrive, if the president looks at it for necessary. 
The payment further 350 billions must be given a farewell in a renewed vote of the congress. 
As a countermove for his/its help Washington gets shares in the backed businesses, that bring in to him/it in the case of profits dividends, and that can sell it again if the storm is past drawn. 
The Federal government will have the possibility, the seizure-procedures respecting the apartments, that are tied at the real estate-credits concerned by this plan, to detain, and to fix periods for the repayment and the settlements furthermore, that are paid at the leading employees of the concerned businesses. 
The developers of the plan would have gladly that the deputy-chamber votes on him/it already today, and the senate then on Wednesday. 
Despite all of her/its/their efforts, it is not yet sure that her/its/their plan will receive green light. 
Actually, further votes began against this intent, as well as from sides of the Republican also as the Democrats, yesterday.

`Vierhunderts excellent economic-professors, under it three Nobel laureates, have written us in order to communicate us: We ask the congress to have put not down itself under pressure, and careful too superior, which way to become a hit ist', he/it explained yesterday. 
At the same time, we received renewed the proof in Europe that it is about a world-wide crisis.
