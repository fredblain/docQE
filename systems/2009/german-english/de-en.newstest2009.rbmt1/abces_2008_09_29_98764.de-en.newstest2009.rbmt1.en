Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma, that he/it writes exactly, is `eine Tollkühnheit'. 
He/it not yet knows where the action of the novel takes place and is it about what there, however, Mario Vargas Llosa tries the project, on which he/it works exactly, insistent to advance, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, the twenty years in the Congo lived and into the Amazon-area pulled. 
Yesterday, while his/its presence on the festival Hay festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project, to which he/it devotes time, is `eine Tollkühnheit' and points out it to `alles that müsste's don't write the novel he/it. 
`Wenn I level-headed would be, I had not done it, but I will do it and hope, someday the novel to beenden', consequently he/it closed his/its participation at the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged, from. Within the four days, he/it has seen hundred of authors, historians, journalists and thousands people, who were in Segovia. 
The author of `La ciudad y of free perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities on the third festival and did prognoses. 
Vargas Llosa that Premium of the festival has won Hay festival and that most present her/its/their voice offering, is compared with the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and is Juan Bravo to see in the theater. 
He/it was introduced by Félix Romeo and determined that he/it had a public before itself, which noticed, that time was given the Peruvian, who possesses a wonderful memory and big humor-feeling, not sufficiently in order to be able to go through everything again: as his/its appeal originated to the literature, that from `außergewöhnlicher Abenteuerlust', from `Freude at the Lesen' and from `mehr wants to experience, as davor' emerges; like he/it writes and `Disziplin wahrt', to supplement about `den lack at Inspiration', his/its intensive work with documentations, numerous corrections and overworks, that he/it does,; like Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas his/its appeal influenced and which `Gedächtnisbilder ' it, that the basis for his/its histories forms, is. 
The hispanoamerikanische novelist arranged that there are `keine type and Weise', by which one judge, and from where one can know whether books change the life, `aber I, to believe me in it, it denies that the literature emphasized pure conversation, a fleeting experience ist', Vargas Llosa whoever claims that apart she/it `Effekte hervorruft' and `die people even more bringt', therefore I didn't ask the author `sich of the ease überlassen' and `die Verantwortung' for his/its appeal `übernehmen '.
