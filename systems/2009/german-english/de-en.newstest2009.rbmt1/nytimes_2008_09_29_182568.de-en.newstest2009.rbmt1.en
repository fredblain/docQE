Obscure street in city, often forgets and, to sell possibly soon, 
New York city has thousands of rush-hour-streets, avenues, side streets and other bypasses, from which some famous and others only comfortable is. 
Nevertheless it is even to be said heavily for experienced taxi-drivers and long-time locals where extra is Place, simply, because most have never heard about it. 
This tiny street is in the east Village and gets lost Street direction north from the ridge between Bowery and Second avenue, without which to reach Second Street. 
She/it is 30 stems broadly and 120 stems long and looks sooner after a dusty alley than after an actively used pass-street. 
There are also no street-signs. 
It is practically impossible to find her/it/them on a Standard-Straßenplan. 
This street nevertheless has her/its/their admirers. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a Bauunternehmen, that has erected luxurious buildings on the ridge Street recently. 
It wants to pave extra Place again, around a clean pass to the stores and boutiques, that are expected in the new buildings, to manage. 
To the other admirers, the long-time neighborhood, that says, hears be she/it fascinated from the short alley simply because she/it is one of the remains of the past of the block. 
However the administration-department, that is responsible for protection and erection of the apartment houses and is responsible for the street, has no interest in it to get her/it/them. 
During a session of the committee for country-utilization of the district council in this month, representatives of the administration and Avalon have drafted Bay a suggestion for the purchase of the street through the Bauunternehmen. 
Nevertheless the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked after a new plan, that should be submitted in the coming month, according to Susan Stetzer, that Bezirksverantwortliche in the district council 3. 
" Only very little area has remained in the property of the city and we would like, that extra still hears " Place the city, she/it said. 
There could be offers, like one the street repairs and what of Avalon could be taken care of drives, however we also want that the public access remains " guaranteed. 
Avalon Bay has announced before some months, pave the small street again and seats, that among other things are thought for a cafe, to which the business would like to rent area, furnish. 
The idea, that Avalon Bay could buy the street, was done during the session in this month public for the first time. 
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said, that the business wanted admittedly to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to possess her/it/them however. 
" The main-concern of the Avalon Bay is it to renovate this dilapidated alley and to do " to a public venue, said her/it/them and added that the city itself had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, speaker of the department for building-protection thought, it has actually been the wish of the city to sell the street and emphasized, the task of the department is it rather to develop the real estates as, to administer. 
If The Boweries compared with his/its colorful neighborhood, extra has retained Place something of his/its historic impression. 
Some believe that the street has received her/its/their name in the year 1802, as apportioned a big farm, that belonged to Philip Minthorne, between his/its numerous children and a narrow strip country from no was claimed. 
The back door of the music-club CBGB, the punk rock-monument, that was locked into the year 2006, opened to the extra Place and the street is certain at the most known as scenery for the photo on the Cover of the album " rock to Russia " of Ramones. 
The plaster was wonderful, Danny Fields said, the manager of the Ramones, who had done the photo in November 1976. 
The street was full from scrap metal, rags and sharing of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes. 
Some inhabitants, including whom Bloggers, that write about the Gentrifizierung of the east Village, have, the idea of the sale of extra Place refused, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, still public should remain. 
Others have praised extra Place as a rarity? a practically unchanged splinter of the city, that should be left alone. 
Jeremiah Moss, that drives the Blog by the name of " Jeremiahs vanishing New York ", untertitelt with " the book of the complaints: A more bitterly nostalgic gaze on the dying city ", Place, that had appeared to New in the magazine " The Yorker " in the year 1952, has published a part of the conversation of the city-history over extra. 
The author, Brendan Gill, has written at that time: " Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and through rusty Metalltüre of the warehouses, taciturn windows and at gutters past flying week-old newspapers is marked. 
With few exceptions, the street has looked in an evening specifically so recently. 
A rat through the rear part of the street, not far from the door, who led to the CBGB earlier, ran where a teureres clothing-business is today. 
Graffiti was to be looked at the walls and an empty beer-bottle didn't lie on the ground far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers. 
Some passer-bys said, they would rarely have thought Place about extra, proposed however, that the street could be polished something. 
Fields, added that according to his/its opinion, some people the attraction of the street in her/its/their current condition underestimates. 
He/it said the best years of my life were in the places, that were dark, moist and disgusting.
