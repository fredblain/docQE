The psychology of the vies - or why we are ready to pay more 
With auctions, the buyers are inclined to it to spend more and to overestimate the sold consequently. 
Neurologists and economic-researchers of the university of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior. 
According to one in the " Science " magazine of published study, the people want fight in a competition, like approximately one auction on eBay, gives and is therefore ready to pay even raised prices. 
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this " game " with experimental auctions. 
A group of the volunteer should play lottery, during the other at a playful action participated - in both cases became the active brain-regions of the probationers by means of more functionally more magnetically resonance (fMRI) examines. 
With both games, the participants could win money, however an elevated activity of the Striatum, a complex below the brain-bark, with losers of the auction, with which outbidding of the opponent plays an essential role, was measured. 
Beside many other functions, this brain-region is responsible for the " self-reward " of the nervous system. 
The researchers therefore thought, the price-increase could be explained through the avoidance of a Ãœberreaktion of the Striatums. 
In order to substantiate her/its/their thesis, the economists have employed examinations to the Nachverfolgung of the money in the researcher-group additionally. 
In this case, three groups should mitbieten against a partner under different conditions. 
Of the true value of the product was informed the control-group, they have done her/its/their uses after it. 
15 dollars of reward were promised another group in addition, for the case, that they emerge as winners from the game. 
The third group got 15 dollars before the auction, that was also lost in the case of a lost game. 
The difference between both groups consisted therefore merely of it that the emphasis with the one on the gain, while lay with the other on losing. 
As the members of the " group playing against the loses " were ready proof for the hypothesis expressed by neurologists to higher uses however, as those in her/it control - as well as the " Gewinn"-Gruppe. 
" These results can be derived from no former economic-theory. 
These have the behaviors observed with auctions only with the joy over the gain up to now namely, as well as the risk-avoidance justifies. 
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the picture-giving neurological procedures, sodass we now a third explanation ready has " - meant Andrew gravels, professor of the economic-faculty of the university of New York.
