Questions after the accident: Are stewards unlawful in the bus? 
The law doesn't know her/it/them, in a long-distance travel-bus, the Umherlaufen is allowed not 
In the context with the tragic accident of a bus of the society of student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question poses itself, whether stewards and travelers during the trip in the bus - and herlaufens are allowed to. 
We " wanted strictly and keep the law formally, so the activity of a steward stands in the contradiction by the law over the traffic ", according to the speaker of the traffic-ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, with which last week died a twenty-two-year old stewardess, was probably caused by the driver of the truck, who crossed the bus the way. 
The young woman sat in this moment to all accident beside the driver, on the least certain place in the car, albeit she/it still had two wide places to the disposal. 
A bus can however also have an accident at the moment or keenly can brake in which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. 
A role also plays whether the bus is equiped according to the vehicle-letter also with standing-rooms. 
If this is not intended in the bus, the travelers must sit. 
The long-distance travel-buses of student Agency have no standing-rooms; something the director of the company, Radim Jan?ura, opposite Aktuáln? .cz confirmed. 
We have discussed " this with the ministry, and this has not first agreed to the movement of travelers. 
Later one has taken back this, and we have reached a consensus, after which the travelers can go during the trip on the toilet, if they have " her/its/their seat, he/it communicated his/its point of view. 
The law knows no steward 
There is no unambiguous legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legal-rule describes this role. 
There is however also no legal-rule, that it prohibits the carrier, to produce services. 
The law over the traffic knows only the concept vehicle-companion; his right and duties doesn't define it however, the speaker of the ministry adds Hanzelka unequivocally. 
The director of the department street-vehicles of the traffic-ministry Josef Pokorný however it thinks that the law covers this problem late. 
" It depends on it whether the bus in the product-admission has also standing-rooms. 
That is everything " then, he/it emphasizes. 
Buses subdivide themselves into city-buses where there are standing-rooms and is limited the maximum speed, local traffic-buses with standing-rooms and a higher allowed speed and long-distance travel-buses without standing-rooms with the highest allowable speed and seats that are equiped with safety belts. 
Like in the airplane, the expert says 
The BESIP-Fachmann for roadworthiness Jaroslav Ho?ín sees no basic problem in the movement of stewards of a bus on board. 
" With a liquid Fahrweise, many dangers don't threaten, the situation is comparable with the service of an airplane on board. 
Also here is not sure, when turbulences come, and the stewardess can bump " the head. 
If you " brake a bus however keenly, of course also the laws of the physics are valid then. 
Equally like in the city-bus or in a streetcar. 
The security of the stewards must clarify " the carrier through internal rules, he/it says and also thinks that this problem is not removed completely from the view of the law. 
Jan?ura is ready to cancel the services 
Student Agency offers as single Busfirma services of stewards. 
The company employs approximately two hundred persons in this function. 
The director doesn't regard her/its/their occupation also after the accident as risk-pregnant. 
" As soon as receives the impression I however, that the occupation of the steward is risk-pregnant, I will cancel him/it. 
Coffee and newspapers can get the travelers when getting on. 
That would lower " also the expenses, he/it thinks. 
As interest in the security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in its bus. His/its society drives however only one fraction of lines in the comparison with student Agency. 
" We have no stewardesses, we fight against it already from the beginning. 
Earlier or later this finishes with any deadly accident ", he/it had expressed not completely one year ago for Týden.cz. 
That was an unbelievable tragedy 
With the accident of a public bus to Naples, a young stewardess had had an accident from the region of Pilsen, that had worked two years for the society. 
The Slovenian TRUCK was turned without probably blinking from the stand-strip and had obstructed the bus the trip. 
The driver of the bus tried to avoid through a sharp maneuver, collided with the right front part with the TRUCK however. 
That the two places have been sold for the stewards, Jan?ura disputes. 
" These places cannot be reserved with long-distance-connections, they are blockaded ". 
Company wants to sue truckers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency won't wait for the judgment, she/it expects a financial damages however also from sides of the guilty. 
A law-It-alteration? 
Not in view 
A more exact regulation of the movement of stewards of a bus on board could bring a lawful regulation, on which a thirty-headed expert-team of the traffic-ministry already works over one year. 
" This however has still reached to no concrete end. 
Buses don't necessarily stand on the agenda, rather the point-system, the maximum speed on the highway also and the application of Handys with the trip ", according to expert Ho?ín. 
" The traffic-ministry doesn't consider the activity of the stewards something, that could essentially endanger the security of the traveler, according to Hanzelka, with which the control of the security of the buses lies in the area of authority the police and the work-protection-authorities.
