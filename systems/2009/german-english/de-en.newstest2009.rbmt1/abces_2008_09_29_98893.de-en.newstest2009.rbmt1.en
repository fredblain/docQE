`Sangre de mayo': Heldenbuch of Garci 
Inspire from `Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spaniards against the French in `Sangre de mayo'. That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 millions Euro investment for the trick-works. 
This way the cineast has tried `eine quantity of personalities and social analysis darzustellen', what he/it has always admired at the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained with the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the start of a long table of the actors today. 
`Sangre de mayo' with a film-length of more than two-and a half hours, is presented this Friday in cinemas and is shown on the station Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries later. 
José Luis Garci, big fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this trick-work his/its `Kindheitstraum ' in fulfillment went. He/it has this to owe Esperanza Aguirre, that engaged him/it before three years of the autonomous community Madrid, a memorial-film to the second century-celebration at the 2. , To turn November in Madrid. Above all, because the history is based on the basis of `Episodios Nacionales', that assumed the job. 
The total-contribution of 15 millions, that was put by the autonomous community Madrid for trick-works, offers Garci as he/it inflicted, that `einmalige Möglichkeit' with help of decorations and corresponding clothings the picture from the `verwirrten Spain, which picked out the wrong leader for the fight, because brought the people had become darzustellen' through the fight for the independence and under the reign of the Ferdinands of the VII in remains. 
However, the cineast regrets that one with the funding like with `Alatriste ' or `Los fantasmas de Goya', twice so high as with `Sangre de mayo', could not calculate, therefore some scenes could not be turned from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci almost worked together his/its whole career. 
For this reason, Garci, that was also film-director in `Volver at empezar', has participated through his/its usual operation: he/it placed himself/itself on the stage in regard to the actors, with whom one must first rehearse, before one starts to turn and he/it appeared to `demütigend for the ones, that had done no Casting, ' and respect procures, `ein part of the occupation of the film-director consists to achieve help in the theater and in the cinema in order to know what of the cinema-industry, in which one works, happens. ' 
Many actors, into whom he/it runs in `Sangre de mayo', must repeat before his/its camera, like in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar-candidate in four nominations, from which he/it has won one, is of the opinion and assured that no one of the three candidates, that defends in this year of Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood, represents a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de Bill-ary francés' and also finally not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film, Garci expects no awards. 
You believe `Am start, that you work for the posterity, later you notice, that it is only for thriving, and now you are content, if one produces another film hat', Garci explains employment after more than 30 years.
