After the vote-defeat 
The fear spreads at the embankment of Street. 
First news of the failure of the rescue-package let the Dow Jones break in about 700 points at times. 
That was the biggest point-loss within one day in his/its history. 
Later, the Dow caught itself something again. 
Against 20:30 o'clock, the stock exchange-barometer most important world-wide wrote down with well five percent in the deficit with 10.579 counters. 
The technology-stock exchange of Nasdaq lay with more than seven percent in the deficit with 1548 points. 
Biggest loser was to this time in the Dow American express that barely 14 percent lost and the bank of America with a loss of approximately twelve percent. 
No title could to hingewinnen. 
The shares of the bank of Goldman Sachs gave in about barely ten percent. 
Few days only ago, Big-investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the business. 
In the framework of the rescue-plan, the methods should be prepared for the buys up of so-called lazy hypo-bar-papers. 
The sum should not be disbursed on a hit however but step-by-step. 
As a countermove, the state should get share-option-appearances of the finance-societies, that could be cashed with corresponding course-development, in order to reduce the burden for the treasury.
