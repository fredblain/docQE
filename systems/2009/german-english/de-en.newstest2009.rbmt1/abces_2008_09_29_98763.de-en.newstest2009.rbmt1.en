`Ich receives the master behind the stage, about his/its character festzuhalten', Günter Brauer, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no frill, no outfits for the appearance. 
The nature of the big flamenco-dancers, that abstains on the concentration and devotes itself the interpretation, to receive about a relaxed look as woman or as man. 
On the one hand artists 
On the other hand personality 
I look in private life in, into these moments, that are foreign for the public, I knows, when I for the personality typical gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or Ausdrückstärke of the hands, that is concerned, because is not entered her/it/them the stage, can find. 
In his/its project `Flamenco-people ' represents builders' abwechselungsreiche theatrics of some productions the German photographer Günter on the stage with singers, dancer and guitarists. From this side, he/it was even little known for the artists. 
With this suggestion, the photographer manages a special Ikonografie of the flamenco-representation on different levels. 
The showing, that belongs to the program of the month of the photography of the flamenco, `spiegelt the international importance of flamenco, that becomes ever bigger from the day to day, wider', the artist explains and clearly does that `Flamenco-people ' `jeder any human being can be, but if one looks at the photos, so the observer notices that it is no typical pictures of artist on the stage. 
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists, who are in the situation, passion, sorrow, joy to mediate on the stage and to move the public with it. 
In order to be able to hold on the personality of these artists, one must do no photos on the stage. 
Her/its/their personality and her/its/their character is in her/its/their hearts. 
What interested me to manage a personal atmosphere, that would enable me, was the characters of the biggest flamenco-masters festzuhalten' with the photo-camera. 
Farmers, inspires from the festival of `Cante de Minas' read, did itself in the year 1997 on a long trip in order to photograph singers, Gitaristen or dancers with a Digitalkamera. 
Thanks to the picture-sorting-function of the camera and the existing material, pictures, that remind of classic photography, originated. 
The application of different stylistic methods destroyed the classic basis of the picture, through which the picture the modernity and the idea, like the farmer flamenco understands, is lent: `Musik with traditional roots that changes and every day überrascht'. 
That is not only the dance, the chant or the instrumental-game at itself but the personality of the artist, his/its character, that tempts the public with his/its art. 
The search after the essential, after a certain something, which in form of the harks, the being visible becomes, is and was the solid goal of this work, that in the near future in the gallery of that El Fotómata is presented. 
Friend personalities in flamenco under them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belongs to the narrow selection of the almost seventy artists, that was photographed. 
The project turned into an anthology of the flamenco and will appear as book, with all portraits from the showing, soon. 
Builder's passion to the portraits led him/it to it to take up this idea two years ago again and to realize as `Porträts of the veterans of the Sports', `SportARTproject '. 
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people ' different is, so the photographer gives to `es pleases me to photograph the people to know her/it/them very much to learn and to put me into their life-condition, be it for a short moment or a longer time. 
I think that the portrait is the most difficult type in the area of the photography. 
You meet or run into persons, personalities, whom you don't know sometimes at all, or they leave you alone for one pair of minutes in order to be able to do a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, as photographer, I try always to realize my ideas. ' 
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco from today with the title `Flamenco-people ' is in the gallery the El Fotómata, that is in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and gets lost la Alameda de Hércules to the street parallel, displayed. You can the showing up to the 16. Octobers view.
