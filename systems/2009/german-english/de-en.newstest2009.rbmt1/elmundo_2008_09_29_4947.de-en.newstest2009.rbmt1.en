Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso has had on it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had on this brand in `Blood Diamond' of Edward Zwick, exactly just like Al Pacino in `Der Pate' of Francis Ford Coppola. Simultaneously, it belongs to clothing of a well built priest. 
If we start to list the innumerable Stars-Auftrittes, so we are able to go back on the picture of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard, that had hoisted heavyweights in a traveling-circus, falls back. 
Essentially taken, that is a typically male T-shirt from cotton, sleeveless and fits. 
The English-language name it `tank '. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands however. 
Firstly, because of his/its wonderful name, although she/it in the narrow circle `Marcel ' is named. The legend tells that the Namensentstehung is interconnected with sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
`La Marcel' towers above all because of his/its outstanding cotton, because of his/its different unisex-cut and draws itself through a small Belgian flag, hardly recognizably, from that these T-shirt have as detail at the neck-excerpt. 
And respect, the Belgian company concentrates not only on the production of `tanks '. 
You/they have also college Sweatshirts, boxers Retro, Cardigans and cashmeres, pants from cotton, T-shirt with strips, Babies, mini shortsÂ…
Modeled and comfortable underwear. 
Although, it is very unfortunate to use her/it/them as sub-clothing. 
You/they are very appealing.
