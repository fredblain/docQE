The pride and the strains in the life of the black population, in a city of the quite particular type, 
Hide between the protuberances of the leisure time-parks in the vicinity of Orlando, few miles of the glittering, is and gigantic drift removes, a quiet city, in which the pride and the complications of the Afro-amerikanischen culture come to the light, lies. 
Eatonville, that first fully black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, it is to be described no longer as simply as Hurston in 1935 did: " the city with 5 seas, three Krocketplätzens, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison ". 
Nowadays, it is a pilgrim-place. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrisons and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Lost festival in Eatonville the most famous author of that Harlem renaissance to remember. 
And is nevertheless and remains the city, that she/it describes? and that she/it to a Touristenausflugsziel it did in that she/it accepted her/it/them into him/it Florida guides, that were produced to the times of the depression of the Federal-author-project? in much sense a place of the quite particular kind. 
Eatonville is so independent, solid and private like in the 1930ern, as Hurston wrote, that rural black communities in Florida often refused to divide her/its/their true thoughts with the white man, that " so little knows about us, that he/it doesn't know something him/it escapes ". 
Even nowadays, in one year in him/it a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, to an open conversation over race-circumstances calls, it is still sorry many here to be observed by outsiders. 
" We are been told 59, from birth at an inhabitant of the city and parishioner of the oldest church of the city, roofed on it like our history, according to Hortense Jones, very much. 
It must be correct ". 
Eatonville will define long time as paradox of the triumph and the fight. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of almost 2.400 inhabitants in which the poverty-quota is double so high as the Landesdurchschnitt. 
It is a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example of that on the one hand - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, that has her/its/their roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that inhabitants here as well as is with pride also as on the hat. 
And so right the misgivings actually began about Eatonville's image with Zora as all Hurstons name here. 
She/it introduced her/its/their home town to the world in books, that came from hearts and were written in dialect, just like " Mules and Men " (1953) and " Their Eyes were watching God " (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida-guide changed the city, that quite close to the route 77 lies, a street that through the often-forgotten center of Florida leads, to the arenas of black history and human drama. 
Impudently like Oskar as well as in the real life also as in the literature, Hurston Leser led first mayor, Joe Clarke, to the store of Eatonvilles and turned to more private issues then. 
" Away from the street to the lefts ", she/it wrote, that is " brown -weiss painted modern school, with her/its/their groomed gardens and playgrounds, of which Howard Miller always takes care, although hardly reads he/it and can write. 
She/it mentioned also the new man of widow Dash and wrote that lee sells Glenn " beverages of each type and goes " was-auch-immer with hour-rooms. 
In only few hundred words therefore brought Hurston Eatonville with self-government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was no guide quite certainly. 
Indeed, this was not a portrait, that was estimated by all. 
" Zora described the things so, as they, according to the 90-year old Ella Dinkins, were " the Hurston one of the Johnson-Mädchen perpetuated in that she/it quoted the men, the songs over them/her/it her/its/their beauty sang that was more fully sexual insinuations. 
She/it added: " Some people didn't like this. 
One still remembers here Hurtson as an active eccentric, who came back regularly, after her/its/their family was drawn after Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if raged Hurston into the city came, she/it this usually without warning did, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and with pants dresses, in a city that even today itself something on her/its/their venerable clothing-style imagines. 
Most inhabitants were fascinated loudly Mr. Franklin whereas much despised her/it/them. 
" The people were Zoras always to see " gladly, Mr Franklin said. 
But " she/it remained never too long ", he/it added during he/it in his/its chair teetered, on a terrace situated to the back, that looks at the Sabelia lake, in which was baptized according to Hurston of all likelihood. 
As Hurston in 1960 died she/it was poor and her/its/their books assaulted. 
Together with the bulk of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her/it/them. 
Although she/it was a famous author once, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard college in the 1920ern, she/it became Pierce, Florida, in fort where she/it lived, in an anonymous grave buried. 
In Eatonville, there was no big commemoration, no public readings in the big style. 
" I don't think that she/it her/its/their contribution in the world or her/its/their heritage in the least, according to Valerie Boyd, has understood author of " Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography over Hurston the 2003 was published. 
The change came in the 80er years. 
Orange county authorities wanted to put a five-track-y highway through the city in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard the slow two-lane main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western outskirts. 
The suggestion was presented as Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his/its history. 
Compulsory-integration, among other things, an end had put down the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 50er years, the fight brought Hass into the community against race-mixture. 
Often came " in this time a pile of white boys and she/it oranges and stuff threw on them/her/it away from sedentary people ", Mr. Franklin said. 
There was a woman was killed that with it even once. 
You/they threw a watermelon out of the car ". 
In 1955 questioned Hurstons in a letter at the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the colonel of court of justice, to force integration, in that respects " her/it/them his decision in the case Brown against the inspector as " abusive instead of my race, marked. 
Inhabitants say nowadays that although the annulment of the racial segregation was positive in some sense, she/it that the group-cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of his/its teenager weakened. 
" Black children were it accustomed to be embraced - I reminds me at it - one they embraced his/its teacher in the morning and embraced his/its teacher in the evening ", according to N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business-leading director of the nonprofit group to the protection of the Eatonville community. 
That could be gotten up for a very long time, she/it added until teachers and students came from the same place no longer. 
" They didn't embrace his/its white teacher, because he/it was a white teacher - I my there is existing " a cultural gap, woman Nathiri said. 
However the franchises have contributed to it that room was made for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists, who disregarded prejudices, just like she/it it did, with positive self-confidence and statements like: " As anybody can refuse itself the joy of my society! 
I don't understand it. 
In the year 1975, the author Alice Walker got going to Hurstons nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her/its/their fame. 
Five years later was a much praised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. to find Hemenway in the bookshelves, and made her/it/them renewed to a part of the American literature-canon. 
The highway-project came exactly to a time, in which Eatonvilles stood most famous daughter in the light of the public once again. 
And Hurstonses saw this time old neighbors she/it as savior. 
The community began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival in order to show something the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the Eröffnungsevent two years later, and every January, many come back for the celebration. 
Some years later, the district of his/its street-building plans turned away. 
" The plans of a five-track-y highway enlivened the city, the totals accelerated with top-speed, awakened real citizen-pride ", woman Nathiri said. 
Woman Boyd somewhat more simply expressed it: " Zora rescued Eatonville ". 
The victory against the highway-project has contributed to a change of the self-picture of the city. 
Newcomers came more and more, just like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer, that goes since 1993 here into the church, and natives began to estimate the past again. 
Eatonville was accepted 1998 into the nationwide historic register. 
A new one-story library, named of course after Hurston, opened in 2006 on the neugepflasterten and beautified Kennedy Boulevard. 
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a peculiarity in Florida: she/it sometimes can only 6 miles of the downtown of Orlandos itself feels like a behind-alley in summer-moving, as small as at that time as she/it from only 27 black families in the 1880ern was established. 
, She/it is black to 90% nowadays, 
Outsider on the search after the history Eatonvilles and his/its meaning is often treated with caution still. 
For most interviews, an authorization is necessarily in the advance and certain things - just like the wall-painting of Eatonvilles eldest church, that was painted whitening by one and represents black men with the field work, - cannot be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, assertive teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot, still fears, that her/its/their shielded community is misunderstood. 
And nevertheless, at the same time to her/it the Hurston-Festival bigger became, also an elevated degree was born at home-pride. 
Above all young people are inclined to it to see Eatonville so like Hurston her/its/their entire race saw: very beautifully, with all his/its problems, neither bad even better and just as proud, creative and hard-working, foolishly and durchmischt like each other races - and Völkergruppe in America. 
It can hear the sincere love to this city that one in the voice from Mr. Franklins Neffen, the 18-year old Edwin Harvey, that intends to come back after the college after Eatonville in order to work in the administration or with the police, that could use some help according to him/it. 
And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, elfjährige twins from winter park, to have, to describe Eatonville right, learned. 
" Most people, that drive through only here, will think: " Oh, this city is nothing in the comparison to all the other ", Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after the church recently. 
" But if one actually stops and looks at a moment his/its history long, it is a very beautiful city ".
