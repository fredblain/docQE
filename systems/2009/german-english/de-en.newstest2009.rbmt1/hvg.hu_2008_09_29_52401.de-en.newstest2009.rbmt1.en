Has few pains believer? 
How newest research-results cover that the religious belief acts as a type " analgesic " that should already have relieved the death of Catholic martyrs. 
Scientists of the Oxford University have enforced an interesting experiment: It was examined, in what way the belief at God influences the Schmerzempfinden of the human being, the British leaf " telegraph " reported. 
In the course of the rather bizarre examination, it got per 12 believers and Atheist Elektroschocks while they studied a painting of God's mother. 
As the results showed, the believers could turn off the bulk of the pains. 
By means of a Hirn-Scan technology, one could even prove that the Catholics could activate the part of her/its/their brain, that for the pain-regulation responsible is. 
The examination was the first in a research-project, at which participates also philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university beside scientists. 
With the attempt, a glistening appliance was tied up the probationers to the left hand which handed over the electro-shocks. 
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: To the one a picture of God's mother, painted from Sassoferrato in the 17. Century, and to the other Leonardo there Vincis " lady with the ermine ". 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin Maria under the believer would evoke a type religious trance while they selected Vincis picture there because it hardly differed from the other painting and as calms was felt. 
The test persons spent per a half hour in a MRI scanner, and got altogether 20 electro-shocks in this time in four stages, while either she/it the religious, or the other painting should look at. 
The Catholics reported, they would have felt with the sight of God's " mother in security ", as if they " would be umsorgts ", and they would have felt silence and peace ". 
During the considers of the religious painting, they have reported over 12% few pains, as if they had Leonardos work before eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, thought, they could evoke similar effects also with other, strongly working pictures also with the atheists, one had to would find the corresponding photo merely. 
" We had to would find a picture, that causes very positive sensations, as approximately one mother or a father ", according to the psychologist. 
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright greeted the results of the research. 
" Practicing of the belief should change our personality, and toots it also in many cases ", according to Wright. 
After these outstanding results, the question only remains which effect a Madonna-picture of Leonardos or another comparable painter would have on the pain-regulation of the believer. 
Achieve the issue even better qualitatively high-quality virgin Maria?
