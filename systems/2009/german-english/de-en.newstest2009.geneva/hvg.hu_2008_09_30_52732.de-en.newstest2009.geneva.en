Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumble bee 
The good method new technologies to development to accident prevention, if not to imitate the obstacle detectors out of the nature? 
For example the the bees. 
By the CEATEC in Japan been a surprising project, by what the Nissan-Ingenieure new from bumble bees by the Erschaffung accident avoiding systems inspired. 
In cooperation with the Tokioter university had Nissan the staging from car robots biomimetische system of type BR23C, a mini car, endowed with the features of the bees, objective, to support, that the development a system everything crashes avoid. 
In flight each bee and forms her own, oval" private area", who our own" protection shield" are much similar, Kazuhhiro Doi told, Produktmanager research and development for Technologie-PR, by the exhibition. 
The compound eye of the bee, what can see in each direction and in an angle from over 300 degree, on top of that comes a into play. 
Around the function of the compound eye to imitate, the researchers picked the idea of the lasergesteuerten distance knife up. 
This one identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a face field from 180 degree inside from 2 meters, calculate her distance and send signals at the microprocessor at Board, who undertake at once the kollisionsvermeidenden lawsuit. 
The obstacle is been in second fractions, and who car robot changed at once by car robot who the movement the bees, while he turns the ripe around the corresponding angle. similar to courses, 
In contrast with former systems find this manoeuvre purely instinctive instead of. 
"If there were not thus, the car robot did not know quickly enough reagieren, in order the Hindernissen avoid avoid", declared Toshiyuki Andoh, ladder of the" Mobility Laboratory" and of the car robot project. 
The system must and mustn't instinctive at once, since this technology corresponds to the interior and vulnerable part of the Schutzschildes -- a layer, currently still than gelten inevitable accidents. 
The total lawsuit must mustn't the behavior of the bees, if they avoid other bees. 
And that must expire in fraction of a second. 
However the ausweichen, in contrast with the bees, can not hinauf happen or good diagonal, hinunter, -- he knows only two-dimensional. 
While here the bees many possibilities stehen, around other bees cannot, avoid himself the researchers by car robot only the drehbewegung infinite open of, or the beschleunigens and to serve Abbremsens. 
The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, who and light energy efficient. 
Andoh and declared fewer on the treatment of the dates, he goes back on the instinctive, intelligent reaction at, of, and still few on the aptitude, this store. 
This appliance must work exclusively some entries per second and proportionally on they react. 
He not this one memories, with the help of early maneuvers produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so that he only an handful KB Memory standard in entitlement take. 
He needs no gigabyte-- and megabyte heavy Memories. 
This the first step the immediate crash prevention technology, who to be after appraisal from Nissan inside the close of ten years serial in production in the development. 
A large application cannot the technology by the GPS-Satellitennavigation, while he thus at goal brings.
