Questions after the accident: Are stewards in bus illegal? 
The law does not know them, in a distant coach the Umherlaufen is not allowed 
In link with what nearby tragic accident someone buses the society student agency the Italian Padua the question turns out, whether steward and traveller during the ride in bus hin-- and herlaufen. 
"'ll and'll we strict formal the law, so the activity of a steward in contradiction sticks to law over the road traffic", thus who spokesmen the traffic ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, by what a zweiundzwanzigjährige flight attendant last week died, probably the of driver truck causes, who what did bus pass the way. 
On what the young woman purged misfortune next to the driver, am wenigsten sure place in car, although she still had two large places to arrangement in this time to all. 
A bus however also or clearly an accident credit bremsen, in who the steward adjusts coffee or journals in the time. 
A also comes into play, whether the bus is also endowed the vehicle letter after with Stehplätzen. 
, If this is not sensed in bus the travelers must sit. 
The distant coaches from student agency no Stehplätze; What ura the director the enterprise, Radim of Jan confirmed. 
"We have discussed with the ministry this, and this first not approved the movement from travelers. 
Later on had one this, and we have were sufficient to a consensus, wonach the travelers during the ride on the toilet go cannot, if they have her seat", he informed his viewpoint. 
The law knows no steward 
"There are no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward-- no right-wing prescription describes this role. 
There however also have no right-wing prescription, who he forbids the Beförderer to provide provisions of services. 
The law over the road traffic knows only the term vehicle guides; What he does however not define law and of obligation ", the spokesman of the ministry Hanzelka clearly adds. 
The director of the department street vehicle of the traffic ministry of Josef Pokorný on the other hand thinks that this problem subsequently covers the law. 
"He arrives it, whether the bus also has Stehplätze in the product admission. 
That is then all", he stresses. 
Buses divide himself in town fine, where there are Stehplätze and the maximum speed limits of, nahverkehr fine with Stehplätzen and allows speed and distant coaches without Stehplätze with the high authorized speed and seats, the with security straps endowed. 
, How in airplane the specialist says 
Who BESIP-Fachmann see ín for traffic security Jaroslav Ho in the movement from stewards aboard of someone buses no fundamental problem. 
"A lot do not threaten liquid by someone Fahrweise of dangers, who situation aboard an airplane comparable to the service. 
Also here is not certainly, when turbulences come, and the flight attendant can wheel himself the head. " 
"However a bus clearly slows down, then the laws naturally also concern the physics. 
Likewise in town bus or in a tramway. 
The Beförderer must clarify through internal prescriptions the security of the stewards", he says and also think that this problem is not completely solved out of the visibility of the law. 
Jan ura ready, to paint the provisions of services 
Student agency affords provisions of services as single bus enterprise. 
The enterprise occupies about 200 persons in this function. 
The director does also not than risk fertile at look at her job after the accident. 
"As soon as me but who impression gets, that the job of the steward is risk fertile, I will paint him. 
The travelers by boarding can get coffee and of journal. 
That drop also the expenses ", he means. 
As interest at the security the director from Asiana Alexej Litvin founds the absence from stewards in his fines. His society however activates only a fraction from lines in comparison with student agency. 
"We have no flight attendants, in contrast we already ab initio defend. 
Whatever mortal early or later on this ends in accident ", he had expressed before not all an year for Týden.cz. 
That was an incredible tragedy 
By accident of someone of Linienbusses after Naples been an young flight attendant out of the area Pilsen, the two year for the society worked. 
The slowenische truck was likely without to sparkle of hard shoulder turned and had what the ride jams bus. 
The driver of the fine tried to avoid through a sharp manoeuvre, however kollidierte with the right front with the truck. 
That have been sold the two places for the stewards, contest ura Jan. 
"These places can be not reserved by distant connections, she is jammed." 
Enterprise will lodge complaint drivers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman not be the agency on the court judgment, a financial damage replacement however also expect them from sides of the culprit. 
An amendment? 
Not in visibility 
An exact regulation of the movement from stewards aboard of a buses a legal regulation bringen, a dreißigköpfiges Expertenteam the traffic ministry already over an year works. 
"This however have were still sufficient to no concrete end. 
Buses do no longer stay absolutely on the agenda, rather the point system", according to specialist Ho ín. 
"The traffic ministry looks at the activity of the stewards not as something, what the security of the travelers cannot imperil important", according to Hanzelka, where who test of the security of the buses in the competence of the police and of the work protection authorities is.
