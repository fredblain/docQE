I receive the master behind the stage, around his character to hold', of Günter of brewer, photographer. 
No sales, no hive, no tailor for the appearance. 
The nature of the tall Flamencotänzer, who and renunciation the interpretation widmen on the concentration, around a relaxing appearance as Mrs or when to get man. 
On the one hand artists 
On the other hand personality 
I look in private life, in these times, who foreign foreign for the audience, I know, me typical for the personality gesture, someone fortifying expression fortifies depth stolen glance the hands, who gets, because they not to go the stage in in, find. 
In his project Flamenco-people'the German photographer of Günter poses abwechselungsreiche Theatralik of some productions on the stage with singer, dancers and of guitarists to bird cages dar. From this side he was for the artists still few known. 
With this proposal the photographer deletes an exceptional Ikonografie of the Flamencodarstellung on distinct plains. 
The exhibition, who the month the photograph the Flamenco to programme the belongs, reflect the international importance from Flamenco, of tag to day always tall declared, wider over', the artist and of power distinctly, that Flamenco-people'each indifferent man his, however if one looks the photos at himself, so the observer notices, that he no typical pictures from artist who stage. 
All normal men on the portraits to arrange and to incite what audience artists, who are in the situation passion, sadness, joy it on the stage. 
In order the personality of these artists cannot hold, one must make no photos on the stage. 
Her personality and her character are in her heart. 
What me did interest, to delete a personal atmosphere, to who to allow me, with the photo camera the charaktere of the tall Flamencomeister hold'. 
Bird cages, inspire of festival Cante of mine ace', continued in year of 1997 on a long journey, around singers read, Gitaristen to photograph digital camera. 
Thanks of the Bildsortierungsfunktion of the camera and the existing material, pictures, about who remind classic photograph were born. 
The application of unlike stylistic means destroys the classic foundation of the picture, wodurch who do form the modernity and the idea, how the bird cage Flamenco understands, lent: Music with traditional roots, who changes himself and each day surprizes'. 
That not only the dance, the canticle his character, who the audience tempts with his art. 
Who research after the Wesentlichen in form of the hörens, the being visible gets, and the solid goal this work, who the El Fotómata is presented time in the next in the gallery. 
Known personalities in Flamenco under they artists belong to the narrow choice of the almost seventy to Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others, the photographed. 
The project the Flamencos to an anthology and soon than book, with all portraits out of the exhibition, appear. 
Bird cage passion to the portraits guided him it, this idea before two years still time when to achieve( SportARTproject'). portraits the veterans the sport' 
Although the plans of the project Flamenco-people'are distinct, so the photographer admits he she much pleases me kennen to, to photograph the people, I and learn in who to put on life condition, he or a long time for a short time. 
I believe that the difficult type is the portrait in area of the photograph. 
You meet or trips on persons, personality, who you sometimes not know at all, otherwise they give alone you minute up for a pair, in order a photo cannot continue. 
Except from these facts as photographer I try always my idea to achieve. '
