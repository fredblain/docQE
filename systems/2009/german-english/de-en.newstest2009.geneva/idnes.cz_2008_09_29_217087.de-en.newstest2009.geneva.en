The first potential supplier already comes in this year after the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The telephony market in the Czech Republic is really mature, the Czech supplier practically offer provision of services to all, as also she offer from their partner in Western Europe. 
All the same something-- a potential supplier, who pressures the classic into low prices. here fails 
Perhaps this one will let no longer long wait for himself. 
That the Czech telephony suppliers work at all to the expensive in Europe, we have already often brought back on Mobil.cz to. 
This moreover also confirmed TÚ, who attentive it to the telecommunications authorities, that the price is here SMS for someone high when the European European Union in rest realised. 
After the last steps he thus devolves probably to a paradoxical situation on the European commission in area regulation of the Roaminggebühren -- for plain customers of the Czech telephony suppliers SMS his as out of the stranger inexpensive at home. 
How does he arrive from, that the prices be thus in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe high? 
The answer is easy, he fails the competition, who really an struggle ansage power. 
Perhaps it ring paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there thus gives three telephony nets and a penetration from far away more than 100%. 
The telephony suppliers curse gladly in contrast above, that he many competition on the Czech market extreme give. 
The the chairman of the council of the Czech telecommunications authorities( TÚ) often also pflichtet ák Pavel Dvo to, by, who had often expressed in the past, that there are no place in the Czech Republic for a large supplier. 
He probably ballots, that no longer have a classic supplier many chances with an own net particular( moreover he also hardly still find frequencies likely). 
There are however still a possibility-- a potential supplier. 
Just now the entry of potential suppliers on the telephony market brought a clear price reduction with himself, on what the classic telephony suppliers mustn't then also react to. 
Such in addition to there still gave before the entry enterprise as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile similar voices on the market in Great Britain in the Czech Republic. 
He have however shown, that there are place for such suppliers and that this one can be successfully real. 
Moreover one does not long after examples to look need. 
In Feb we have reported over the departure of the potential supplier Mobilking in Poland this one. 
In only an half year there succeeded this supplier, more to win and thus fünfgrößten customers suppliers the country as 100 thousand to rise. 
Behind Mobilking the finance group Penta on top of that declares, who in the Czech Republic under other U: own fon. 
The advantage of potential suppliers consists in on top of that inside, that one can concentrate on a much concrete target. 
In order cannot work effective, potential suppliers namely need many few customer as a classic supplier. 
They namely need no relative high expenses for the building, the enterprise. 
In the world the potential suppliers thus normally than Low-Cost-Firmen heraus stand out -- they offer inexpensive telephone talk and of SMS, what however often few bulky provision offer from someone accompanied. 
So Tesco Mobile for example at least offers in Great Britain SMS around the half inexpensive as his competitor. 
, As however the example from Mobilking shows in Poland cannot there also a really good failure train, on a to put on not stereotyped target. 
This supplier namely addresses himself specific at men. 
"Authentic guys elect Mobilking -- who they can and trust supplier, who they please that", according to David Seibert, the CEO from the Mobile entertainment company, the operator enterprise of this potential supplier. 
Difficult to say, how whether foot cannot also take a similar plan in Poland in the Czech Republic. 
daran the press spokesman from Vodafone Miroslav also doubts epický: "The Czech market for a market segment, on who the many potential suppliers rest on, relative small. 
Moreover he is saturated out of the visibility of the provision offer relative. " 
In the Czech Republic the telephony suppliers mean fate, 
However almost sure sure, that, if a potential telephony supplier Czech Republic conquers, this not Mobilking. 
"We indeed say this successful project from an expansion, despite everything in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particular optimistic. 
He gets eher to an market entry from Mobilking in other countries of our area kommen ", so dissociates ková in a telephone talk for Mobil.cz Jana Studni of, press spokesman of the finance group Penta. 
Indirect she thus certified, that not the current telephony suppliers this thought in the Czech Republic particular leant. 
On the contrary 
Her interest at a departure of a potential telephony supplier already shows Novera, who liked like a large step, in order a real competitor enterprise customer from Telefónica O2 in area since long time to the group of GTS. 
"We a tall interest daran, only to offer also provisions of services. 
And per early, all the more improve. 
Over this possibility had we with all Czech telephony suppliers negotiate. 
With some from they we cannot already reach negotiation progresses ", thus who press spokesmen the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps good times now come. 
Out of not official information hervor go, that perhaps to wait the first potential supplier the year until end. 
Up to now though this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of the silence. 
"In this time we do not leave from it for, that place consist in the Czech Republic for a complete potential supplier. 
The Czech market shows tall compared with other markets Spezifika. 
Up to now no subject have still answered us project with a complex and thoughtful in this area", mean e in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr out of the press department from Telefónica O2. 
On the Spezifik of the Czech market large suppliers also indicate. 
The press spokesman from T movable Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the explanation from O2: "Up to now we still found no viable and profitable beidseitig project, on what one cannot beyond build." 
And she adds: "In net from T movable a potential supplier will hardly emerge until end of the year. 
In this time we mustn't already have a concrete offer existence, in order cannot thus think in the short run. " 
Vodafone obtains his attention rather on the fulfilment of the requirements of the own 3 G licence. 
Miroslav epický means to it: "For negotiations with potential potential suppliers we open, in particular in area dividing from expenses and of infrastructure. 
We consider out of the visibility of the customers just now this as the good. 
The main strategy from Vodafone in this area finds in the research after a partner to assembly of a dividing net for a fast movable internet. " 
The responsible authorities -- with the suppliers hand in hand 
The process of the telephony suppliers is easy to understand, a large supplier called competition many, this and also became go down prices thereby to a decline of the profits lead. 
Then one a such competitor the market entry erleichtern? 
That can cannot the suppliers at a cord, if there go around something, also long justify hin und her that around the genesis from U: fon. 
The strong well impression in direction TÚ went from, as U: fon on the market went back, T movable from the society out of. 
The public accessible information from the TÚ-Webseiten also justify that. 
Now though just U appropriate: why fon than argument, one shall not admit a potential supplier. 
Martina Kemrová noticed it: "The competition environment of the telephony market recently moreover still a fourth supplier through the entry fortified. 
Under obvious obvious, that a new actor put his provision of services high requirements on on at the market even and above all. " 
Against this herangehensweise of the suppliers absolute lack of interest of the Czech authorities however surprizes that. 
He is on top of that not only a matter around the position of the TÚ, who the competence unfortunately not has-- developed in difference to Great Britain and large anticyclone states-- in Czech, in the economic competition to intervene. 
This one owns exclusively the office to protection of the economic competition( ÚOHS). 
This however reported his all typical position to this total problem. 
"The market entry of a potential telephony supplier were then possible, after and he a potential supplier the necessary infrastructure to an contract end between a telephony supplier over the Anmietung come. 
Up to now no such contract was closed, thus the offer of potential amateurs not probably for the classic suppliers sufficient interesting", thus in his answer to our demand Kristián Chalupa from the department foreign relations of the ÚOHS. 
From representatives of the suppliers someone not surprise such formulation. 
From an authority, who the consumer interests replace and inter alia it to respect, that nobody his position on the market abuses, this is many when dubious. 
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In stranger, potential suppliers all normal to get accustomed, to observe that her market entry have contributed to a price reduction by movable provisions of services." 
Probably though belong the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction not to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Really shocking is at this fall who almost already touching accord the three telephony suppliers, who results from her reaction. 
The question, whether he is a matter really only around a coincidence, finds on the hand. 
How likewise the same absolutely gas price is certainly only and coincidence the consequence of an hard competition struggle by the service stations. 
"The authority have discovered no signs in this matter, who to indicate a gerichtetes against the competition bargaining, and therefore also they no reason, on someone take in the matter intervene. 
No the suppliers a domineering market position, therefore he does no longer have the corresponding increasing responsibility for his bargaining on the market. 
The regulation authority for telecommunications probably also lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the telephony market for potential suppliers ", Chalupa led in his explanation. 
The interpretation of the dominate position on the market is a from many controversial points. 
Naturally there are an analysis of the major markets, worked out from the TÚ, after the telecommunications out of the visibility of the economic competition a single market is. 
On a such market then naturally nobody the Czech telephony suppliers a dominate position inne. 
Plain Rechtsexperten however offers an other visibility way-- for the market entry of a potential supplier always the agreement of the net operator is necessarily. 
And the telephony suppliers the monopoly for his net-- wise--. 
Who, that he necessarily takes a dominate position in an affirmative segment mean. 
Himself that if one however not gives up with this argumentation, there shall be at least a warning for the ÚOHS, three telephony suppliers auffallend advance similar. 
On top of that grievances of a line from amateurs( enclosed of the mentioning society of GTS Novera) justify, that they trip by negotiations with all suppliers on very similar obstacles. 
The Abwälzung of the responsibility on the TÚ is then a really customary trick, with who the ÚOHS dissociates matter from the whole in the provisions of services. 
This was already in some similar falls to watch. 
Unfortunately there have not succeeded, in who recently did vote amendment the telecommunications laws the expansion the competences the TÚ the economic competition on the area in who do to impose telecommunications, although a line had promised an improvement the situation from specialists it. 
That mustn't only too well the representatives of the ÚOHS, thus probably they other interests. 
There already go, if nobody looks 
Unnoticed the functioning of none of pseudovirtueller suppliers, from who there are at once several in the Czech telephony nets only once stays. 
He however only partially enterprises, who own price tricks handle movable provisions of services, who public. 
Normally he is namely a matter around enterprises, who to agieren in area Multilevel-Marketing. 
Own movable provisions of services for example offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, to Starlife and others. 
The price tricks of these enterprises normally reach only for Auserwählten. 
The joke of the matter consists in inside, that a tall amount orders the enterprise compared with the operator when classic enterprise customer emerges, who at SIM-Karten. 
As important customer he then gets special price offers( and other offers). 
The problem consists in inside, that the business conditions of all Czech telephony suppliers ban a took similar sale. 
"There shall be falls, who to describe you, then he knows himself around an injury, with who who do contractual conditions bargain we we then development, what took a completion of the cooperation with the corresponding to society occupies", Martina Kemrová replied on our question to this problem. 
However really unlikely unlikely, that the telephony supplier thus a little not leaks by the officials. 
In particular in fall of the three mentioning enterprises he can be a matter around thousand customers. 
No operator opposes to however a such process. 
Out of who namely simultaneous to get not activity these enterprises fliessen they not too neglecting profits they-- in difference to the real potential suppliers-- through the real official marketing compromize. 
On possible problems make epický Miroslav attentive: "The law allows such ways from speculations, in spite of all only the provisions of services these enterprises the customers from a very minimal percentage take hold. 
This one must moreover accept, that the SIM-Karte not runs in her telephone on her name, she then not the telephony suppliers complete above have at disposal like the normal customers. " 
Arrange alone that but the TÚ mustn't at least meet strange. 
Moreover a large question for the ÚOHS opens himself. 
Do the telephony suppliers before a such process close the eyes, why ban they himself against a potential supplier? 
There is to add, that the ÚOHS Aufdeckung such activities really strong competences to, and if he not likes, not must he himself with the explanation the supplier, they knew nothing it and her business condition this bans, zufriedengeben. 
When the Czech Republic are no longer at expensive 
As already time and again stresses in text, the market entry of potential suppliers taught a clear price decline the unlike provisions of services. 
Where on top of that have practically tried in all countries, been potential suppliers, the classic suppliers, who genesis practically to prevent more or inferior. 
The using from they arguments were practically identical -- a too small, respectively. too very saturating market, problem by the quality of the provisions of services etc. 
In the anticyclone developed countries though the regulation organs just now intervened in these times, who by no means the interests the telephony suppliers, the separates their customer to wahren tried. 
There is or niece formal through formal measures impression, they achieved that the first potential operator was born, and this one followed large. 
Unfortunately the Czech regulation organs speed himself the whole fall too like a warm potato. 
Ready from our experience not we we the impression entledigen, that more than favourable confusion in the competences in these falls. 
Despite everything we do not throw the gun away in grain. 
If a potential supplier and soon emerges the background information stimmen, the Czech market will perhaps soon again set himself in motion in. 
, If a supplier admits the genesis of a potential telephony supplier will not be passively that ÚOHS, if there go darum, to refuse( discriminate). large amateur 
And the Czechs then finally no longer telefonieren expensive as the rest of Europe.
