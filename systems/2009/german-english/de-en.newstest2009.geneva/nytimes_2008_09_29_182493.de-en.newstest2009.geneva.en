Debate around bilingual training: Formation in English-speaking surroundings 
In this expense of the" Education Watch" discuss Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates to bilingual training. 
, Managing scientific collaborators in Kalifonischen study and managing director in department of formation science at the Pacific Research institute for a Mitverfasser of the book" is not thus good Public Policy, as one thinks: Why a school choice needs the mean class ". 
To answer the hispanischen electors an intricate task. 
Barrack of Obamas proposals to topic formation a typical example in contrast. 
Obamas election campaign mentions, what the probability by afro-amerikanischen and hispanischen pupils" who school to close successfully, low is, by white pupils" -- what ballots. 
, Around this performance distance to schliessen a bilingual footbridge phase in the training for this recommends Obamas formation plan special under other, the English only learns. 
Who however the question at Obama consists in inside, whether his commitment for the bilingual training, puts the centre of gravity languages on on teaching in other as English, his interest contradicts, to reduce the distance in the school performances. 
We as example" Sixth Street Prep" take, a primaryschool in oriental fate of Angeles. 
The majority of the pupils is hispanisch and families struggle through with low income. 
More as a third of the pupils, only many since short in country, English learns. 
However pupils of the fourth class have passed surprising in 2008 100 percent the state examination in Mathe on a good level. 
Surprising equally 93 percent the children out of the fourth school year in the examination when evaluates well. 
This surprising success been with other methods, when this, who from Obama be to prefer by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street puts her centre of gravity in checking and of exercise, on constant and test the knowledge a position, who no exceptions tolerate. 
The large the school practises the approach, after what the training occurs in a English-speaking surroundings. Exactly that is the point, shall who Obama, according to the school director Linda Mikels. 
This approach puts value in the almost exclusive use of the English language. 
Mrs Mikels, who does the idea of bilingual training refuse the,, who school had a remarkable success with a pupil said to me, only little in front of out of Mexico come. Late of 12 months one cannot and no longer recognise the class space betreten him. 
"He works", she marked down," he works for we". 
Obama a school Latin-American and others like the" Sixth Street Prep" as model for other school with tall part English learnt pupils expect? 
The performances of the school be the answer to this question light, thus the bildungspolitischen positions inside his own party( the national Bildunsgvereinigungen for years support the idea of bilingual training) and his own consistent support of the bilingual training continues predictions over Obamas answer uncertain. 
That while he approves the point, migrants English to learn, recently trivialisiert he the topic himself worries manufacture over the aims at" only English" legislation, while he noticed, that men shall stop,. 
stattdessen, he said: "She to provide, that Spanish knows your child". 
If Obama will really close the performance distance, he shall take carefully models into account, who to work, instead of.
