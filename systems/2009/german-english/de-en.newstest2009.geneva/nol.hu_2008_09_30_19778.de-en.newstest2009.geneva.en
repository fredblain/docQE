Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0 
By the elections at Sunday no deputy of the opposition deleted him in the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers meinen, this finds at prosperity and of stability in that from Alexander Lukaschenko guide land, the OECD however supposes Gesetzwidrigkeiten by the breakdown of the voices. 
The OECD, who out of 43 countries of 450 observers entsandt, the elections have not recognised. 
Of end indeed devolves since decades without opposition on legislature of the 10 million inhabitant state. However the himself who names" uniting democratic forces"( ODS) combined Gegenpartei under that before the yesterday elections hoped serious, that Lukaschenko by the smuttily elections and thanks to a constitution change to be 2006 presidency mandate already to fourth time renewed, this time deputy of the opposition in parliament" zulassen comes to the agreement". 
Therefore even the ODS from who beforehand expected boycotts distance taken. 
The Ukraine always economically thanks to the steigenden prices by gas import from Russia dependent. For the relief of the price increases credits were even taken, and the country also the cession the Beltransgas, the properties of the distinguished through the country gas pipeline, Russians agreed. In the hope then suited the opposition, the Ukraine'll her report with the EU, after Lukaschenko and others high-ranking politicians entry ban because of the as ranking undemocratic political system in the EU. 
In what for a passing relaxation the exploitation report of the elections of the OECD, rather the accentuation on the positive movements, instead of on the faults-- like about the ausschliessung of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections-- attended were. 
However the fast report of the OECD already criticised the campaign-- consequentially Oppositionelle cannot not meet in the press-- and in particular the fact, that not the opposition the voices his by the breakdown present at Monday. 
In spite of alledem the opposition gets an improvement in political system recognise: Political prisoners were about laid on free foot, and Minsk even too small confrontations with Moscow ready, while still he the gratefulness the independence the dissident Georgian provinces Süd-Ossetien and Abchasien refuse, although Russia a federative state forms, the two order since a month when independently looks. 
"We forwards and had upside down two steps someone, however the important the, that and the dialogue the EU between Belarus started", Alexander Milinkewitsch said to our leaf. 
After view of the opposition candidate of the presidential elections from 2006 a continuation desirable, although the powerful have" gotten fear, also only an opposing in parliament to give up ". 
The opposition plans no protest measures against the results ahead, only the need of a economy reform rather tries the to explain electors. 
"We here to fight with many problems -- the opposing journals must be printed in Russia, who local authorities put on we by stones in the way drove away, though however I shake, that men always more support the transformation, even the old" -- Milinkewitsch dissociated in allusion it, that not even the meistunterstützte layer the Pensionisten with the Lukaschenko-Regime in agreement the, what single salary is the production social security. 
"Until who thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the rise of the business deficit there is only a question of the time, gemahnende" a cemetery social security at the silent" to crumble begins", thus Milinkewitsch. 
In contrast with opposition politician Russian observers have the elections when qualifies democratically. 
, Explaining leaders of the mission of the community independent states the pressagency Ria Novosti: "The men believe the acts, and not the words". The absence of the opposition is from then on a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.
