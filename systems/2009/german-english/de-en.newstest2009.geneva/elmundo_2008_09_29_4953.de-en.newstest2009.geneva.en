In sleep to talk 
Some children speak up overnight 
I do not mean this, who do and wake we up in addition to to tell something, what at day in front of to happen, the children separate, who during the sleep do speak up. 
If it happens to you to first time, in good fall been you that no meaning. 
That is a positive sleep turmoil, who the sprechen gets in sleep mentioned. 
They relatively been, above all by the children and of adolescents. 
Safely, told more as a from you that you have spoken up up overnight. 
This phenomenon occasionally attitudes( a time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (, close each day, a time per week, a time in month) at day the child can remind himself nothing. 
There have no single reason, who this phenomenon causes. 
Often been links with other phenomena in sleep, like nightmares, panische fear overnight, of Enuresis noctura (bed ooze overnight), speak up in sleep looked, however there in contrast brings no reason. 
, As we have already early mentioned him he knows at very high Fiber, stress situation or overwork deckchair. 
Anyway, that is little studied phenomenon. 
The frequency, with who he emerges, is very variable. 
He can be, that quietly one in single words pronounces, whisper or he knows all an opposite his( cries, wines, long discussions). 
In the falls, if the statement very intense, recommended, what to watch child and beraten to give up himself by a specialist, in order verify verify, whether a, what problem exists fear and completely causes on this way come. 
We have said that there are a positive turmoil, then it is not called, there is, she is associations, who treats development knowhow with an other sleep turmoil (to example, otherwise Schlaf-Apnoe with the stress). 
What one can continue, a series from easy prevention measures achieves: 
The child before the schlafen not to tries arouse. 
Well, quiet game for the child looks and stressige fernsehprogramme avoid, who and a little terribly too savage. 
By the nervous children, who, cannot relaxations of relaxation methods enforced, in order to help them to get a certain interior calm. 
That helps quietly the child to sleep. 
If the sprechen once meets in sleep, to keep the calms try. 
Think about, that there are for the child insignificant and at next day he erinnern knowhow, what have happened at nothing. 
Useable councils 
Do not wake him up. 
That is useless, thus the child is unconscious, so you tear him out of the sleep. 
Although the child speaks up, he sleeps, then he rests. 
Think about, if he shows ver√§ngstigt a pair phenomenon himself after, so recommended, himself deliberate or discover, what what reason does child have for the fear. 
If they understand, what it says (what is not thus usual), do not pressure the child, in order to recover more information. 
So you get if in order cannot nothing, because the child sleeps, there is and unconscious above not reflections know. 
Moreover, will hear you, what it says, but what you do not get learnings, he the say, that's why they cautious with the interpretation the information and the ends, who her daraus leave. 
Perhaps, he does not tell the child that that hears she overnight and his secret knows. 
Not even as joke. 
That causes many fear. 
Well, continue no worries, there is nothing bad, that is a time, who only lasts few minute.
