, If the energy entspringt out of the waves the tall suddenly fail 
He not someone drying up money source who over 70% surface of the planet does and erst jetzt cover glimmers this the tall energy enterprises the world to understand. 
Waves, currents and Gezeiten how the new renewable energy sources are who now all to look, and also to occupy to look of, about giant Chevron. 
The possibility, to earn energy out of the movements of the sea,; Not by chance these studies since the first oil crisis considerably intensified himself. 
When the price of the oil collapsed around 1980 gas one the idea of the sea energy, now though called the environment organisations and the upward oil price for new impulses in this sector. 
Who World Energy Council( WEC) estimate in London that were extended 15% the world-wide energy needs from the produce through the ocean waves energies. 
This equaled the double of the produce momentary through nuclear powerstations energy. 
On top of that moreover still came the currents and Gezeiten. 
Giant by attack. 
The first enterprise, now lays the sea energy who, Enersis in year of 2005 a contract to institution from a powerstation in north of Portugal signs. 
When this news was published around a revolutionary step there himself to bargain seemed. 
Late two years now always more he enterprises out of the traditional energy branch, lay the marine energy extraction who. 
"Chevron examines these technologies" known the American American giant according to the spokesman of someone enterprise in Wall Street newspaper and weigh the possibility with we team up." 
There go hierbei in order to throw the acquisition an admission from the American energy commission, who is necessary, around a project before the coast of Alaskas. 
. If one thinks, that just now still oil in Alaska through the U.S promoted Bush and recently only gets president the plans for new Bohrungen in speed put on. 
Next to Chevron the enterprises Verdant Power Inc are also. new out of new York and Ocean Power Jersey, the in the new branch invest; The details are also not known, so observers thus speak up from a steigenden interest. 
Still improvement worthy technologies. 
Expert still talks from someone in aufbruch of sealing technology, this not in the end, since the last doubts are still not clarified by sides of the environmentalists. 
So far seriously to cause projects too took ecological problems like this one in Portugal and also Scotland from rather small dimension and glimmer no. 
In order however energy produce produce in tall scale, he needs technologies with intensify tall impact on the environment. 
There are unlike possibilities: Ocean Power about a system from connected together buoys wears down. 
The batch of the waves, what the buoys on and downstairs moves, over piston and of top hat are turned inside the swimmers into hydraulic impression. 
, What anew this one pushes a turbine a generator activates. 
The current gets skilfully over inferior conduits to coast it. 
Until now there gives four expected installation of this way, what only still on the national authorisation wait. A part of the winning energy cannot also serve for military arrangements. 
Verdant Power produce while already energy cooperation submarine turbines East River for a merchandise department-store and a park bib in from N.Y. 
The water movements while the Gezeiten drifts the turbines at, what who through the be born drehbewegung generator does eat. 
According to Verdant already wait for a long snake from possible customers on the necessary Autorisierungen around these energy sources to profits. 
Only the waves, then the Gezeiten. 
An exceptional interest deserves the potential according to the institute for current extraction research immediate, what in the Gezeiten put on. 
, Although he is also a matter around an irregular phenomenon the Gezeiten are thus prediction liquid as wind currents good of, the sun irradiation, and from then on a trustworthy current source. 
Just now the Gezeitenenergie there the, as New York, Maine it, already to invest 7,5 million dollar in year of 2008 brought for 2009 million are already planned ahead until to 35.
