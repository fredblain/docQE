Who and the proof sheets the black population proud in life, in a town of the all exceptional way 
Withhold vaguely, few between the outgrowths of the leisure parks in surroundings from Orlando miles from that sparkling, lute and of gigantic activity, are a quiet town, and the pride the complications the Afro-amerikanischen cultivation vorschein kommen to. 
Eatonville, who and black town the homeland town Zora Neale whore sound, no longer thus simply to describe whore sound he act in 1935: first complete in country "The town brown with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, of 300 skin, 300 good swimmers, of more as enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Today there is a pilgrim place. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are Zora to the per year! Festival in Eatonville come in order to commemorate the Harlem rebirth the famous author. 
And however is and stay the town, who she describes and the they to a tourist excursion goal made, while they they tourist guides in the Florida took of, the to times of the depression of union writer project produced in many consideration a place of the all exceptional sort. 
ist thus independently, gediegen and private as n in the 1930er, when whore sound wrote, that rural black municipalities often refused in Florida, her true thought with the white man divide, the "thus few over we, that he not knows what he escapes know." 
Even today, in an year in the a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Sen. Barack Obama, to an open talk over breed report call, he many here moreover suffer, from outsiders watched. 
"We much been it like our history told", thus Hortense Jones, 59 from birth at a inhabitant of the town and municipality member of the old church of the town. 
He must ballot. " 
Eatonville long time the triumph and of the struggle as paradox define. 
There is not only an historical example of the black movement when also a municipality from almost 2.400 inhabitants, in who the poverty quota is thus double high like the country average. 
There is on the one hand a citadel of the literature and on the other hand an example of the -- sometimes condemned, sometimes gepriesenen -- black cultivation of the rural south, who her root has in the American slavery. 
Not surprising surprising, that here inhabitants. 
How and so aright the doubts began as a matter of fact s image around Eatonville'with Zora, here all whore sound calls. 
She the world her homeland town in books her, who came from hearts and in patois written, so and Mules Men""( 1953) and" Their Eyes were watching God "(1973) 
Five sales in the tourist guide changed the town, who all approach the route of 77 are, a street who through the often forgotten centre of Florida guide, to the theaters from black history and human drama. 
Shameless as not only but also in the literature, whore sound represented Oskar readers first mayor, Joe Clarke, and in real life to the shop from Eatonvilles private matters then turned. 
"Left to abseits the street", she wrote," the seals brown- weiss paint modern school, with her caring garden and playgrounds, around who Howard Miller always care about, although hardly he vine harvests and to write." 
She also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that was-auch-immer too hour zimmern suits. " 
In only few Eatonville then brought hundred words to whore sound with Selbstregierung in connection but also with, illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was all certainly no tourist guide. 
In the act this was not a Portrait, what from all were estimated by all. 
"How Zora thus described the things according to the 90 jährige Ella Dinkins, they were",, a the Johnson-Mädchen who did whore sound immortalize, while they the men quoted, the songs over what their beauty sang, who full sexual allusions. 
She added: "Many people not liked this." 
One here always still remembers at Hurtson when a sprightly Exzentrikerin regularly returned, after her family had left after Jacksonville, Florida,. 
Augustus Franklin, 77 reminded, that if whore sound in the town roared came, they this most of the time, lärmenden without warning act in someone Chevrolet, smoking and with trousers dress, in a town who even today a little imagines on her respectable garment style. 
According to sir Franklin many were been the many inhabitants, while they despised by they. 
"The people were always happy to see Zora", Mr Franklin dissociated. 
However" she did never stay to long", he added on top of that while he swung in his chair, on a timely after in the end terrace, the on does Sabelia lake look who, in what whore sound all probability after baptised. 
When whore sound died in 1960 she was poor and their book attacked. 
Together with the bulk of the world schien Eatonville she oversight. 
n, although she was long ago a famous author, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the single black Mrs at Barnard of college in the 1920er she got in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she did live, in an anonymous grave put on. 
In Eatonville there were no tall commemoration, no public readings in tall style. 
"I do not believe that they have understood otherwise her contribution her inheritance in the world in minimal", according to Valerie Boyd, author from" Wrapped in Rainbows", of someone biography over whore sound the 2003 publishes. 
The bend came in the 80er years. 
Orange County authorities'll a fünfspurige freeway through the town, in order to replace boulevard, the slow zweispurige street the Kennedy the municipality. 
Orlandos suburbs had already urged the freeway of 4 through the western outskirt. 
The proposal was subjected, when Eatonville still always sat up from a difficult phase in his history. 
Constraint integration, inter alia, the relative idyllic isolation the municipality an end put on. 
In the 50er year the struggle against Rassenvermischung brought hatreds in the community. 
"In this time a cluster of white boys often came and they and sped oranges business of sitting on the offsides people", sir Franklin said. 
"There even once had a woman who were on top of that killed. 
They threw a water melon out of the car away. " 
In 1955 the claim of the supreme court, to force integration, checked whore sound in a letter at the Orlando Sentinel while they what decision in fall Brown against the school council when" offending endow my breed respecting "qualified. 
Inhabitants today say, that though the removal was positively the rassentrennung in many consideration, they who and the group cohesion the opinion his adolescent in Eatonville weakened. 
"Black children he accustomed, hugged -- I remember daran -- one tomorrow hugged his teacher at and one hugged his teacher at evening", business distinguished according to Nathiri, girl from Ella Dinkins and director of the gemeinnützigen group to protection of the Eatonville community. 
That cannot be thus long gotten aufrecht, she inserted on top of that, until teacher and pupil no longer out of same place devolved. 
"One did not hug his white teacher, thus he was a white teacher -- I mean a cultural cleavage is existing", Mrs Nathiri dissociated. 
However the citizenships have contributed to it, that place whore sound for large Zora Neale created -- black author, actor and of artist, who over prejudices put on, so how he made them, with positive opinion and to express: "How someone can refuse himself to the joy of my society! 
I do not understand him. " 
In year of 1975 the author Alice Walker continued on the way to whore sound anonymous grave and to fight with the resuscitation of their Ruhmes began. 
Late of five years someone was many praising whore sound biography from Robert E. To find Hemenway in the libraries, and she continued renewed to a part of the American literature kanons. 
The distant street project came exactly to a time, in who Eatonvilles famous girl again once suited the public in light. 
And this time whore sound old neighbours saw them as Retterin. 
The municipality began someone whore sound festivals in order show show what the sector the freeway zerstören with the building in 1988 with the planning. 
Thousand from fans late came to the opening event two years, and many sweep for the fête each Jan backwards. 
Late some years the sector from his street plan turned away. 
"The plans of a fünfspurigen distant street restored the town, the whole with pointed speed accelerated, authentic bourgeois pride waked up", Mrs Nathiri dissociated. 
Mrs Boyd a little expressed him easy: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the distant street project have contributed to a change of the Selbstbildes of the town. 
He Zugereiste more and more came, so Rachelle Munson, a lawyer, who here go since 1993 in the church, and Einheimische began newly to estimate the past. 
Eatonville were taken 1998 in the national historical register. 
A new einstöckige library (naturally after whore sound called) boulevard opened neugepflasterten in 2006 on that and beautified Kennedy. 
Today Eatonville are still a feature in Florida: Only 6 miles of downtown-area of Orlandos sometimes anfühlen they himself like an aft alley in summer rain, thus small then n as they from only 27 black families in the 1880er founded. 
(She is today too 90% black.) 
Laymen on the research after the history of Eatonvilles and of his meaning are often always still treated with caution. 
For the many interviews an authorisation things in parking area necessary and certain -- so and the Wandbemalung elders church, who from a weissen were painted by a weissen black men from Eatonvilles by the field work represent -- not photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones,, that her abgeschirmte community is misunderstood always still fear. 
And however, to who the whore sound festival got tall, an increasing degree was also delivered at homeland pride. 
Young before all men tilt it, to see Eatonville how whore sound saw her total breed: Magnificent, with all his problem, neither bad proud assiduously, still better and likewise, creatively and albern and durchmischt everybody other breeds-- and people group in America. 
There the sincere love to this town the who cannot one nephews in the voice from sir Franklins have after the college after Eatonville to return, in order otherwise in the town administration by the police to work, the are he something help use. 
And even the young,, elfjährige like Alondra and Alexia Kenon twins out of winters park, learnt, Eatonville aright describe. 
"The many people, only here who who, be:" Alas, this town nothing the other in comparison to universe", Alondra Kenon recently told at a Sunday after the church. 
"However if one really stops and a time long his history looks, there is a very beautiful town."
