Inspire from Episodios Nacionales'from Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci puts mayo'Sangre of in the überarbeitete version of the famous uprising of the Spanish against the Frenchmen dar. That an admirable film in the Filmografie investment for the shootings. 
On this way the Cineast have tried to represent'an amount from personalities and social analysis, what he have always admired at the works of the famous novelist, today explained Carci by the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at beginning of a long directory the actors.

José Luis Garci, tall fan of the literature from Galdós, insures that his childhood dream'went thanks to this shooting in fulfilment. This to owe Esperanza Aguirre, who he he before three years from the autonomous community Madrid instructed, to turn someone Gedenkfilm to second century fête at 2. November in Madrid. Vor allem, because the history rests on the foundation from Episodios Nacionales', supposed who the mission at. 
The total contribution from 15 million, who from the autonomous community Madrid were put on on for shootings, afford Garci, by the autonomous community Madrid as he inserted, the sole possibility'with help from decorations of and corresponding exercises what picture of entangled Spain, what the wrong leader for the struggle looked, because the people the Ferdinands the VII through the struggle for the independence and under the domination in residue brought represent'. 
However the Cineast regrets that one knew with the financing as Goya'( twice thus high when mayo'by Sangre of) not calculate fantasmas or fate by Alatriste'of, that's why some scenes out of the scenario with Horacio Valcárcel, with the Garci fast his whole career teamed up, not turned. 
Out of this reason, Garci, who film director was also empezar'a in Volver, through his usual work way have collaborated: He expected the stage to the actors, with who one first necessity before one repeats begins to twirl and for this, who had continued, he appeared humiliating'and respect providing, a part of the job of the film director consists in inside, and help in theater in cinema carry out, around know, what in the cinema industry, one work, happen. ' 
How many actors, on what he trips mayo'in Sangre of on, must review before his camera, in fall from Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Academy Award candidate in four appointments (from who he have earned someone), the opinion and policyholder the, that nobody the three candidates, who Hollywood to replace of in this year Spain before the Academy, an young generation of the Spanish Filmographie represents. Weder Sangre of mayo', still Siete mesas of billar francés' and in the end no longer the choose film los ciegos'girasoles. 
For this film Garci waits for no distinctions. 
At beginning you believe that you work for the nachkommenschaft, later on you notice that there are only fürs gedeihen, and now you are Garci satisfied declared after more than 30 years, if one have still produced a film', job activity.
