The Sudeten called from the U.S for a people decision 
The sudetendeutschen the Böhmerwaldes in year of 1945 around the Angliederung at the U.S require. 
This hervor goes out of a letter, who maintains in the collections of the south Romany scientific library. 
If cannot we not component of Germany or Austria, so we the U.S at least under the patronage from America to live. 
With a such wish 1945 some groups from Sudetendeutschen shall turned to the American presidents. 
This hervor results under other from a letter, who been support in a private archives of and the today in the collections of the south Romany scientific library keeps. 
The Germans from Krumau ask the American president in the letter, he the return the" Sudetengaus" -- who from Hitler were taken on the basis of the Münchener treaty by Hitler -- at the Tschechoslowakei not erlauben. 
"We have aright understood the situation and we will be really sure of the words, that not the American units as Unterdrücker and enemies German territory go in, separate as liberators", he calls in a letter, the with the words" of man, who the fate of the Sudeten at stroke are" signed. 
That since the connection lets suppose the sudetendeutschen-- in knowledge of the Czech national character-- at the Tschechoslowakei, they brutality, rücksichtslosigkeit, incomprehension, oppression and dignities wait for slavery, ask the authors of the letter the American presidents, for today and on eternal to assume the protection domination over the Böhmerwald. 
"We can not believe, that you without consideration on the view of a quarter million inhabitant this area a for we foreign state these, who minorities oppress and to abolish nothing and tries purely good to victory of the allies contributed", is in the letter to read. 
The reason in contrast, why the authors can not sign, supposedly the fear before revenge gelüsten who Czech Unterdrücker"". 
If the American president doubts at the opinion who Böhmerwalddeutschen feel, there is sufficient, if he initiate a people decision in Böhmerwaldgau over, above who inhabitants part the U.S development the U.S lives or under the protection domination. 
Although the text the letter the Nachkriegsgeschichte in present knowledge a little naively klingen likes, he marks a good picture as for the former waits of the sudetendeutschen however after opinion of some time witnesses. 
Even if mustn't at least guess the Romany Germans, that one negotiate over her repression out of the republic, himself only granted few from they a such possibility at all a. 
Some waited, that the U.S and Great Britain a way autonomy aushandeln dignities for the Sudeten. 
Again others believed, they cannot stay simply in the Tschechoslowakei. 
Who confirm also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who out of Budweis do date back. 
He was started in war as stall wise German by the navy at the ostsee by he. 
When one he in a prison camp after Holstein brought, dozens large Romany German devolved on him, he shall teach them Tschechisch. 
"They believed, if heimkämen they, they the Czech to suit kommen", thus Chalupa. 
Nobody the German prisoner of war, who had lived before the war in the Tschechoslowakei,, that one he the Bene- on the foundation expected it his opinion after to drive away decrees out of the republic.
