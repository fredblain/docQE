Duel on knife edge: MP3-Player against cellular phones. 
We recommend you by your election 
, While each cellular phone MP3-Dateien can almost play no MP3-Player can still telephone. 
From then on he naturally sees according to end that there are good of, himself to buy only a telephone. 
Why despite everything there are sufficiently reasons in contrast, one shall adopt an autonomous player. 
The election all hangs the future from the way of the use and the entitlements properties as of. 
Certainly one buys with difficulty himself for at home a great expensive recordplayer, in order himself it to listen to the new album from Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once it also in contrast appears musical novelties not on LPs, out of qualitative visibility give he no objective reason. 
Have you however LPs with way skirt, you dream probably at least from a such jazz or blues in shelf,. 
So that is also with the music on rice, well, with komprimierter music simplify expressed -- music in MP3-Format. 
Also here there are price-- and quality categories. 
For the someone perhaps not likewise he satisfactory, for a player of 8000 crowns to handle, however a Pink-Floyd-Fan profit with difficulty earpieces for twenty crowns of market supports. 
Two extreme, between who there are sufficiently space for each. 
The choice is gefächert great. 
Also the life duration of the batteries is decisive. 
Some good Music player can much more cannot as only music, however the, to know what cellular phones cellular phones, they delete not even hint way. 
No modern appliance is thus universal to start like the telephone. 
Next to the crucial functions, what and telefonieren that cornices, he can reproduce music and of video, to take both, he once has a good, paint a bad camera and perhaps also cannot. 
, And if one still includes the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren one almost a small computer in the bag. 
There is a small miracle, thus no refrigerator and barbecues no television fotografieren. 
Yes the Universalität of the cellular phones also brings disadvantages with himself. 
Per more functions you on your cellular phone take hold, all the more frequent will mustn't however nachladen you he. 
And the abspielen from music is a the tall Energiefresser. 
Only few cellular phones more than zehn-zwölf to play hours, most of the time he much less know music. 
In this consideration Music players (special the easy) effective distinctly. 
Therefore you shall expect it by the cellular inexpensive phones, that not they long when hours music can play a pair. 
, If you then telephone as of and at still you still buy preferably himself to security for an drawer appliance fürs office-- also passes for expensive appliance. 
By MP3-Playern do not get you this problem who few good stops at least 9 hours non-stop enterprise aufladen with a time out of. 
A large problem then exists, if one likes überspielen the music on cellular phone. 
Unfortunately only a minimal part of the appliances over someone arranges USB-Abschluss, moreover each cellular phone without special software does not look direct at a PC plug in. 
Naturally one knows überspielen directly the music on a memory media, thus only few card readers without reduction ready with the minuscule memory cards, the in cellular phones use development. 
By players you need no special software except exceptions( iPod). 
They need only to feed the appliance over USB-Port with music out of your PC. 
The cellular many phones and of players even put a music library on, tidied after the name of the Interpreten, the title of the album, the gender or of for example the evaluation through users. 
Some appliances only the tree pattern of the address directory the, similar the Windows Explorer, many both( iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephone with operating system). 
Players are easy to serve, cellular phone more know 
Concrete by the choice of someone appliances you himself the in particular after the life duration accumulators, who and naturally also memory capacity, the quality and that type the sound the Bedienkomfort erkundigen. 
Above all and music wing hören you they each day for you only little for example in the tramway, then a cellular indifferent phone offers, the MP3-Dateien play. 
What does really already almost each cellular phone know. 
They must no longer check particular, what a cellular phone or a player can work music formats. 
MP3 succeed all, and the many music, who you get, am just in this format. 
The format belongs to widespread to the at many, and moreover knowhow who most also play appliances music WMA-Format in. 
Fewer customary AAC (a format, the Apple and his use iPods). 
Cellular good phones allow online equally the purchase from music. 
One needs to call the corresponding sides of a supplier( or an other supplier) only over movable internet, and already one knows a song or album acquires. 
Why this provision of services can already in contrast be an irrefutable argument at and for himself, one shall adopt a cellular phone. 
Unfortunately the supplier is badly the offer and most of the time only limits fast radio tubes. 
The prices are no longer the low. 
Generally though one leaves from it for, that in future just now this way the sale the music industry beherrschen from music( there is over GSM, internet or wireless internet). 
The many by himself carry the cellular phone. 
If you have desire of, himself to listen to something, you take the cellular phone in the bag, during who players oversight at home is. 
He arrives however it, whether you also carry always earpieces or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung by himself. 
, Over who almost if you resort not, knowhow to the integrated loudspeaker each cellular phone arranges, however only the few MP3-Player. 
The tall well advantage of the cellular phones will find for a lot in price. 
The inexpensive normally less cost crowns as 3000. 
For three -- and you already get 4000 crowns an all suitable Walkman. 
The tall handicap will be for the many, that no normal earpieces in addition to. 
The good and technical end mature esten telephones with someone of 3,5- mm-Öffnung for normal earpieces crowns cost until to 15000. 
The advantage of the players anew finds in the light service. 
The easy -- and not absolute inexpensive (look at choice)-- everybody can really serve players. 
A minimum at functions, who the recordplayer is early or for example resemblance by the service with that normal cassette taperecorder visibly. 
He then threatens enormous bill for data transmissions of no crash of hiring in form of someone erroneous movable internet and someone. 
What appliance shall one now take 
Also the cellular inexpensive phones( for example Vodafone 527) arrange Slot in the rule over someone for redeemable memory media( type M2, microSD u. ä.). 
Even if nachkaufen you a corresponding card, 2000 pass crowns out of. 
Despite everything respect. 
GB are supported only cards in the rule with a maximal capacity from 2 by the basis models. 
Only the expensive can also read 8-GB-Speicherkarten. 
If will already and still'll you a cellular phone besitzen himself a low-cost MP3-Player, then you take Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity( max. 2 GB) must then no longer put on as 1100 crowns on the table. 
Belong you to the demanding earpieces, you take preferably cellular spezialisierte phone-- Walkmans( Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung). out 
These appliances autonomous Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and the Bedienkomfort devolves thus at who heran a single MP3-Players. 
At large Sony Ericsson are here, what cellular phones the same interface out of the series Walkman like the selling single MP3-Player. 
The same services in the same price category from high until to 4000 crowns, but with someone memory capacity( until too 16 GB) and a long accumulator life duration (normally 15 hours, maximal until to 35 hours) MP3-Player carry you out who upstairs so-called makers.
