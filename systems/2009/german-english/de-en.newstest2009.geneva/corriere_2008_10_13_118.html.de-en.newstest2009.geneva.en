The Superkleber, who let hochgehen 
The forces of the gravity thanks to a glue hochklettern to know Superman. 
This is the object from four American research centers, from who someone have was now apparently almost sufficient at goal. 
Annoyed qcm with an on a surface from only 2,5 Kleber there have succeeded the researchers, to record someone 100 heavy kg bodies on a vertical wall. 
Who studio an American publication has, and of the results the researchers the university the Georgia institutes Technology the Air Force Research from Dayton, Akron, Laboratory publish. 
The inventing from the researcher team material a development a who already used of glues, what an exceptional carbon pattern, called Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"One can imagine like a line of ordered to a stack tubes the principle of the Klebers", explain of Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia to institutes Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists himself from the to inspire feet of the Geckos let, overcast, the what a perfect stop to give animal. 
The durchgeführten with unlike materials like glass Teflon and ribbon paper tests shown, that the new Kleber is zehnmal strong, when and to go away let at once" the stop aptitude the feet the reptiles problemlos from the wall ",, spirited according to Liming Dai of the faculty for engineer sciences of the university from Dayton. 
At walls ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material cannot be put on on as short-lived glue", on top of that put Liming Dai on. 
About in order emporzugehen like Spiderman at walls? Perhaps already, thus fascinate profits rather think at someone few about the researchers, electric like about the connection appliances, thus the Nanoröhrchen likewise leaders from heat and of electricity. 
Large application areas cannot result in the area from the astronautics. 
For the time the Superhelden must then still wait. 
Who also other way the research the university from Berkeley, California, devotes to a new Kleberart. 
Who himself in an article of the American Chemical Society the Californian scientists and thereby always present a glue out of mike fibers as hairs even clean through movement on a surface of dust a perfect liability bewahren.
