You are, what you inform over you 
On the occasion of their tenth birthday Google with Fug and law asserts: How she is in the bags of the men likewise to find, over her head at sky: Where she knows had the men her holiday. 
And in order Eric Schmidt always still not enough, great. 
In direction sceptic, who horror sights be to torment by Orwellschen, he obtain lets: This one did get rightly the important of the web of 2.0 übersehen. 
financial in an interview with that times Schmidt recently meant, the main goal from Google he, still more personal information over users according to the original objective the close enterprises to come, wonach they" all information this world ordnen "like. 
Schmidt declared, Google always still only weltverändernder work the Informations-Sammelns after ten years at beginning. 
Asked after the status Schmidt meant Quo in five years: He wanted, Google in the situation or, to wonder" how I shall tomorrow make?"" what job do really suit to me?" to reply, however still not software programmes it in the situation, since they not knew enough over the users. 
Not from who all internet user is himself over in clear, that the research terms were noted in train of their internet research, also the IP-Adressen, were been end, and who paid visit sides by. 
For example the introducing before two years" Personalized Search" and later on allows the visitor to his own research course to memories it to resort, so that am later on generated the strokes many precise, and on the same logic the thus so-called" Recommendations also rest ", with who preferences and because of of the early recommend the system maßgeschneiderte products provisions of services. 
Who however user questions himself, what in fall of an datum abuse happen --" if nachschaut one, what I make"-- many prove worrier above the Google-Datenmonopols. 
In the many falls there is however rather the represent from the enterprise, potential power, the fear irritating achieves of, and few the schuldgefühl or the fear of punishment, the ambition after freedom or the Aufbegehren against the power, the by many Internet-Usern refusal strikes. 
He is however stored an established fact, that not only the research terms, also separate in reason fall at thirds spread get, and in these law falls there brings no protection for the personal laws of the internet user. 
An parade example hierfür recently the process against pedophilia in handed Google of the Brazilian government information over in train of who, who name" Orkut from the community site "gathered and also someone Identifizierung the pedophilias allowed. 
Worried about personal laws user however still aufatmen in May, when Google left successfully jointly with the citizenship organisation EFF against the FBI before court: demnach Google can be also in future pressured with no point of the constitution into it, information the FBI on request publish. 
(However successfully the union government the return from 50.000 web addresses and of 1.000 research terms that voting youth protection law under reference before years get, however you the list the single user, or who web -- and research term list on two months deprive rückwirkend.) 
Googles image then stays controversial: This one, the her personal date grudgingly publish, because they through the use of the Google-Dienste the loss she Privat -- and intimate sphere fears, who himself the enterprise with the represent conservative enterprises due indignation scourges. 
While sees the American" Geek-Kultur", who is in many countries present and enthusiastic computer fan, activist and user eint, the next generation of the "cool contractor" in they, in contrast to Microsoft, what thanks to Windows market leaders, even if both fight same around that goal. 
A possible reason hierfür is, that no Identifizierungscodes asks Google his Usern in contrast with Microsoft, and his service free to arrangement put on of, attractive so that an open, continuously updating source code and of Programm-Package far away, adolescents and cool to be seem, the official practices the software giant. 
On the other hand the Geeks twig the problematic report of the personal law and the internet sharp -- a report, what web of 2.0 in particular in the past years thanks to the term" "in the centre blown. 
By" web of 2.0" same same there around nothing other, the around Kollaboration, pronounce, user leaves intentionally trace and the available profit communication channels, and even if the extent individual distinct are, the essential stays same, namely himself public to prove. 
An average young can simultaneously manage his profile on several community portals -- from Facebook over Xanga, this one services, about Twitter by means of other, or music service as connect together last.fm, and this in the end in a Nachverfolgungssystem as about FriendFeed or Blip.fm integrates. Over hinaus can führen they Blogs, who photo galleries represent automatically the new esten, the on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a line of large exemplary falls proves: By betrachten of the party photos of the past night soon find the friend heraus, with who himself her disloyal friend plays, otherwise the collaborator entlassen gets, because only too honestly he his trouble air power-- someone is sure: in his Blog over the business management Who" privatsphäre" got term meanwhile complete newly interpret. 
Who does a Online life behave, that is, what preisgibt he from himself -- thus in about one cannot formulate the reason idea behind the behavior of the present youth. 
Who and does who try to keep something secret, or good what to dodge Google-Monopol, gladly that tun -- as about with Scroogle, a tool, what indeed take on the search engine from Google, however intentionally no traces leave. 
How not few men do not also note intentionally the online applications from Google, about Textverarbeitungs on community sides, in order not auffindbar she, though -- and graphic tools of and RSS-Feeds, give up let itself with alternative versions, who Serverparks are tied up up at no gigantic and from then on no longer the bestmögliche profile of user generates. 
The public public opinion waits while bewitched it, until her true face shows Google. 
With her current value from USD of 156 billion. the enterprise even finds before IBM( USD of 140 billion.), Intel( USD of 124 billion.) or coca-cola( USD of 110 billion.), the Werbeflächen from AdWords/ sense the takings of the advertising agencies threaten, and the always fast introducing provisions of services ready not only Microsoft only also other developers, bother. 
Critical observers however also find the worrying Gegenpole: So have had about the conglomerate direction a protest of the collaborators complete, after the dues of the firmeneigenen kindergarten were doubled, moreover the management, who repeated food the collaborators to meant expensively. The whole however requires mild quite simply in contrast, that agreed with a convention was, wonach all regime critical strokes, or those, against the good taste who contravene, filtered out. 
The internal regulation of the conglomerate is, that Voraus applied no new provision of services in gets, only separate if this one is also already available. However again the events the future months and of years plain strengthen umkrempeln: While some mean, Googles book-- and Magazinscan-- respectively. Archivierungsprojekt meanwhile accepts extent, that soon himself the enterprise with the supreme court display, so other rather because of the system" Health" worries, the the establishment of a complete health profile with the help of from diagnosis, doctors and problems allow. 
And the fact, that Google a genetic database rebuilds, deliver the next generation of the Sci-Fi author to already the material -- about" Scroogled", the famous novel from Cory Doctorow describe in good orwellschen way a future, in the a man thanks to from Google reporting dates frightening close liquid.
