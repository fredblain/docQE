Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees by danger that means that they also feel fears? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Also much animals have feelings. 
Only how did one know überprüfen whether they feel the same, if they similar to himself like we restrained? 
In the internet publication" Edge" contributions of famous scientists are published since several years. 
Mirrors online presents choose in a series answers to the matter" what to stop you for wahr, without he cannot prove?" 
I believe that sensation and other conscience condition have animals, without up to now otherwise me or irgendwer this proofs where we can not even yes prove, that consciences have other men. 
However in this case we can at least hope, all human brains same reason configuration aufweisen like. 
As soon as of the empfindens or all generally the conscience anschneiden, we go in for impracticable soil, because the hardware not agrees. 
, If a rat meets in danger she makes the same like a lot other animal: She stands dead, flee or attack. 
Men behave similar, woraus many scientists on a comparable subjective erleben close. 
daran I do however not believe. 
Two aspects of the brain pattern make it difficult to translate our subjective erleben on that from animals. 
To someone to close who präfrontalen almost always assoziierten with the human conscience schaltkreise the lateral Cortex a (because of his participation at short time memory and at the version --/ piloting functions). 
Is men by much high developed when by the remaining primates and to fail seem by other creature complete. 
At least by those aspects of our conscience, what Cortex depends präfrontalen on, darunter what learnings, who we are, and the aptitude to plan ahead and to decisions, then pass reason for the assumption, that the man even differs primates from the other. 
A large dramatic feature cannot find in the linguistic nature of the man: Since a thus tall part of his erlebens is associated with language, it often orders, the conscience slopes it as of. 
In this fall one cannot exclude animals. 
, Yes even if conscience not depended on language were be this one he certain, so that bestial conscience, how he also provides likes himself, probably very from the many of our conscience condition distinguished. 
Therefore to establish, like consciences with difficulty appearance by other animals. 
If he himself. 
The many of my version bear on the content of the aware erlebens, despite everything there next door still have a large aspect of the conscience, who his scientific easy accessible. 
One cannot examine the conscience lawsuits from animals without consideration on her content, and exactly that happens by studies over the short time memory from primates, in particular at example of the Visualisierung. 
Despite everything by this approach, the Christof cook and Francis Crick handled, one rather transfers the neuralen correlative of the conscience when on the causal mechanisms: Both no longer like identical his otherwise. 
Curiously this approach also stresses the meaning of the präfrontalen Cortex for the Zustandekommen of the Visualisierung. 
What now produces himself for the sensations? 
I bring them back it, that an emotional system the fear his own activity aware brain like that in someone activated. 
What we than to qualify" fears", then the mental condition, in what we seal, if the activity the locating in brain defence system (or who consequences, physical reactions) work memories justify. 
Thus seen sensations are tied closely up at the areas of the Cortex, the primates and in particular the man label. 
Distinguished Abstufungen of the empfindens indulge in associations with the linguistic nature, because 
On the other hand Antonio Damasio for example think, that sensations the Cortex and of the Hirnstammes hervorgehen out of primitive activities in the body feeling areas similar to Jaak Pankseep, who himself on the brain tribe concentrate. 
, Since this network have much not changed himself in run of the human evolution can be participated absolutely in him at type comprehensive sensations. 
Purely theoretic I can not contradict that, it considers however for unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argue, what by rats and men like fear appear, feel probably also in two fall: How though can one verify whether rat and of man feel the same, if they behave similar? 
Does a cockroach flee by danger whether she also feels fears? 
In my eye just behaviour resemblance can still prove no Erlebensgleichheit. 
Indeed the neurale comparison beyond helps: Rat and of man in contrast similar brain tribes, cockroaches not even a brain. 
Though is the brain tribe responsible for sensations? 
And himself if one cannot prove that for the man: How'll one prove him by rats? 
I believe, that rat and other mammals of, perhaps even cockroaches (who does know?), sensations have. 
However I did not know, how I shall prove that. 
And because fundamentally himself her sensation alleged from the our distinguish( since the human conscience rests on on special schaltkreisen and on language), I study preferably the emotional behavior as the emotional sensations from rats. 
At any rate progresses on the neuralen plain here wave, according as one sises the same by rat and of man. 
As I not study language and conscience by rats, according to no longer sensations, I do thus not know whether they exist. 
One likes that for short-sighted keep, forwards, than continuously to run against a wall get away kind. 
Me rightly a practical Emotionalist.
