Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box 
Als Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 themselves first at school day at the Tachibana Highschool vorstellen, the girls to chuckle begin: The German is kawaii total""! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana already knows the word out of mangas-- in new Austausch-Log she talks to Japan. 
"The first school day in Japan. 
I was annoyed. 
Already before the school way I had Bammel. 
I live at edge of Tokios in direction Kawasaki and take 40 minutes with the train to Tachibana Highschool. 
I mustn't find the way alone, fortunately I not occurred. 
How does not seem at the Tachibana to thus severe determined at home by we in Niedersachsen. 
What pupils tailspin a the as of eight clocks, until around twenty before nine a short discussion round with the teacher baits, 'home room'. 
, Yes before the teaching started I was at the line, to present me. 
In addition to not at all me the type, who speaks gladly up before people, still inspired before someone it from 40 pupils. 
Because I still had no school uniform, I have put an old jive of my guest mother on, it blouse, blue sock and black leather shoe. 
In this lift, aright to pronounce all: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' -- I call Sylvana, get out of Germany and birthday in a week. 
In the time were very happy, that already had me before merchandise two years, the language to learn. 
The 31 girls in the class and continuously me the word" Kawaii" belong. 
I already knew out of my manga that. 
He belongs to survival important vocabulary of Japanese girls and mean sweet', süss'. 
Then I am fast on my place gehuscht. 
The girl next to me have giggled relatively great, she found it an honor, that the swap pupil shall sit next to she. 
The rest of the hour was quietly considerable, despite everything than who Gong did soften, I was attacked real. 
All talked higgledy-piggledy and chuckled and holes in the stomach-- to understand Japanese with difficulty, in addition to there is authentic English. asked me 
In the break all then undid her Bentos. 
A Lunchbox also thus made me-- that is once something other of German as the doleful break bread. my guest mother 
Me and rice salad a way meat with kräutern, small Würstchen, out of cucumber and of seaweed, fruit in Tofumantel. 
Most of the time I have no pale glimmer, what exactly I here eat in Japan. 
The things look strange and recently taste absolutely. 
Party declares that all is authentic delicious. 
Naja, perhaps putting on plums salty, brrrr! 
The Bentos not only simply lunches at Japanese schools. 
He sometimes comes, that a girl a boy a even prepare Bento offers, what she then executes particularly kunstvoll -- in the hope, who to learn kennen boys by close Pausensnack. 
It I have read in my manga comic-strip. 
I am once tightened up, whether I can here also watch that. 
'Thus rightly Japan?', have had my friend, when I told them, that I will go for an year in Tokio to school. 
I have then always said: 
"Because he now once fascinates me." 
In the end I already read preferably mangas since years. 
, And in order I inside better understand the comic-strips and the cultivation I have also one day begun, a little Japanisch to learn. 
For me was then clearly absolutely, that I mustn't one day hereabouts travel. 
Thus me also a weakling for tradition, wont and of custom. 
And on the one here puts tall value on. 
On the one hand Japan a country the new esten technology and of trend-- auf der anderen Seite there is severe, disciplined and traditional. 
, And because all is thus good organise here also still not had me lost, even if Tokio is the tall town, who I have ever shown up up. "
