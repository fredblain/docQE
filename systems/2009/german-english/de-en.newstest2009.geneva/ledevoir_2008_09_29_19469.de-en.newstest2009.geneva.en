Interview -- of blood, that again certainly got 
Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10. year day of their foundation, and their president, Dr Francine Décary, to delight all reason himself, then Hema-Quebec are to a the sure and efficient blood banks of the world. 
And above all wiedergewonnen they the confidence the public turns upside down. 
How one knows, the managing of national blood reserves during the 1980er year with the HI-Virus and what does hepatitis C virus contaminate. 
Against this drama and of the dissatisfaction of the public the government of Canada managed a public in Feb of 1994, through the judge Horace Krever inquiry drove a, who to goal, to bring light in the circumstances, the to a such tragedy led, to work out and directives, around a renewed disaster of this to prevent way. 
While judge Krever was still nervous, to put back his report, several provinces then imagined a committee on the legs, what there were goal, a new system to administration from blood preserves in Canada to elaborate. 
In Quebec the committee Gélineau fulfilled this mission. 
After the reports from Gélineau and Krever two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who around what is concerned about Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, and to handle others provinces the two territories. 
1998, when Hema-Quebec have taken her work hardly 38% the people confidences in the blood preserve system in Quebec, remind himself Dr Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
Through the huge efforts in order the security of the blood preserves improve improve and through the work on this area during the consecutive years, we have regained the confidence of the public', say her, before she stresses proud, that confidences in Hema-Quebec meanwhile had beginning of 2008 almost 94% the populations of Quebecs. 
Dr Décary keeps however in conscience, that a little confidences extremely fragile '. 
Since their foundation at 28. Sep of 1998 bring the caution to Hema-Quebec after the principle. 
To this time we attended the attitude of numerous falls of the human form of the beef insanity in Europe of, a new way of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit, tell this woman, who the direction holds since the foundation of 1998. 
And we not the minimal idea whether this disease to translate over the blood. 
Then we appointed a the main directive of the reports from Krever and Gélineau, who in conformity with one exclusion measures enforce, if one not knows this and if a disease advances only slowly, as visibly he the fall by the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit, who express through a Degeneration of the brain, what leads inevitably to death. 
Then one accepted no blood from persons in Apr of 1999, who himself since 1980 long when a month had held in U.K. 
Now, before some years proven doubts without everything that this disease is translated over the blood. 
So this one have shown event, that the principle the caution, what we enforced, absolutely a sense. 
1999 a much exact technique to identification from HIV appeared on the market: Who directly Nukleinsäure-Tests( NST), to who to allow him, the donor the deposit the in blood to prove virus of himself, and not what who antibodies virus, he by against that who the fall was up to now using tests. 
The NST allowed him, to shorten the Inkubationszeit, the between the moment, the person dispense and who, if am proven the first viruses through our technique in blood, take place, explain the specialist. 
This time cannot be reduced to in the end by few. 
So the risk, that were dispensed certain donors, without he to know, and one this not recognise, decreased important. 
These improvements allowed AIDS over a blood bloodtransfusion to to him, the risk, translate, in considerable measure to drop. 
Today a from 12 million persons danger danger, to get dispense blood with HIV. 
With other words that means, that mustn't mustn't one 12 million blood preserves, before someone were contaminated with HIV. 
, Since Hema-Quebec shares each year between 400.000 and of 500.000 blood preserves he got many when 24 years last, before appearance, by who HIV translates over a blood preserve got a fall. 
I believe that one can today feel well in addition to, if one gets a blood bloodtransfusion or prescribe, in order the health restore restore', mean the management leader from Hema-Quebec. 
Our challenge for the close of ten years he get. 
One does never know, what krankheitserreger can reach in system. 
Only how in past year the Chikungunya-Virus have emerged on the island Réunion, what, likewise the Westnil-Virus metaphorical. 
We fort überwachen', doctor goes. Décary non-stop, before she stresses, that Hema-Quebec moreover puts a be sufficient supply on next to a sure supply to arrangement. 
The need increases, because the population ages. 
, Since the treatments to cancer struggle are aggressive the patients often need new red globules or Blutplättchen. 
To what the ageing of the population also thwarts himself end, only 3% the in average on the blood donor net to blood gifts of suitable inhabitants of Quebecs belong. ' 
In addition to each healthy man of, the 18 year or old is and the qualification criteria fulfill, all 56 tage, well six times in year, bloods give. 
In average 14% the persons, who her blood to put on to arrangement, not adoptive, because for example they at AIDS or malaria erkrankt, and who been in a country, in the malaria spreads is, blood gifts for an year of excluded. 
With these 3% we delete him, a to get inventory, what the needs of the hospitals correspond. 
Deficient stocks are very rare. 
But one must mustn't the members of this donor net, if get old she and no blood of more gifts. 
Difficult difficult, to convince the people of it, to give, before all to hold however, her and it to bring, to get regular donors bloods they. 
The life is today blood gifts thus feverish, that one finds the time rare, an hour by to pass', complain about Francine Décary. 
With a year budget from 297 million dollars not only deliver Hema-Quebec to blood preserves, human fabrics also separate, underneath Knochentransplantate, heart works of, eyeball and of skin, who almost exclusive by heavy fire injuries used. 
These fabrics examined, reshuffled and frozen, before am zwischengelagert they by Hema-Quebec, who the single public cord blood bank of Quebecs also manages. 
In the umbilical cord, who early consider as biomedizinischer waste, rich blood, who to serve it seals knowhow at stem cells, serious illness, to treat for example leukaemia,. 
Before some weeks we celebrated the cellarage of our thousandth blood test, and we plan ahead, to remove yearly more than thousand. 
We shall begin well close beginnings year by it, to put him on for transplants to arrangement', Dr Décary declares large, who this programme the cord bloods-- blood test when describe very loved. 
Many mothers are convinced by it, no access to it', thus Hema-Quebec lacks the means, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals of Quebecs offer.
