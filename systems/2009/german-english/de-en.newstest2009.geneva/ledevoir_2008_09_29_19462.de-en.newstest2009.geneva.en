Free opinion -- the orwellsche speech from Barrick gold 
In their expense of 17. Sep Le Devoir published a letter from sir Patrick Garver, Vize-Generaldirektor of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This one certifies, and someone on top of that pursues orwellsche logic, that small destitute house house and bids the tall gold extraction society of the world a libel complaint over six million against three authors for someone, with that aim, a public transparent debate'to open. 
That if he ballots, the judges are independent and unprejudiced, then they do not over the truth, above all not in fall from libel complaints, only over the law appreciate. 
How erwartet, was this fundamental difference hushed absolutely up by sir Garver. 
Thus for Barrick gold to guide a public debate of, everybody to drift of, the the good way in the ruins he dares, a the her to replace contrary opinion. 
All at once, like the lawsuit suppose, what and authors the editor the book Noir Canada development considerable sums ausgeben duty, around her defense prepare and with very irregular weapons against a armed forces from lawyers fight, the out of the almost inexhaustible bags the gold mine pays. 
The tactic by these irregular struggles often in remaining, who the opposing party continues mundtot of and moreover each put off of, the he dares, himself again with the question to handle. 
, If Barrick liked gold really a public debate they her visibility the things präsentieren duty before the public public opinion. 
In contrast with it, what in many the countries, Barrick gold work, speed and gave, debates are normally adjusted in Canada through the swap from ideas and not through bludgeon blows. 
He then had, if and had offengelegt the gold mine her book and of files a real debate open, independent through the journals, media, publications and the financing Prüfteams, who had sparse in this question bringen. 
Though Barrick gold seem no confidence in the public public opinion and aloof wipe the petitions and of letters to support of the authors from Noir Canada with an Handbewegung. 
Cannot perhaps sir Garver declare, simultaneously cannot he debate around a public'and in addition to yes who rightly opinions this public missachten? 
Apparently this word in the world of the vice president consists of only the generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; Someone all beautiful beengte visibility wise of the term. 
In a democracy even slanderers the right to speak up. 
What gold not understands Barrick-- or not understand-- is, that the public, who and the authors editor from Noir Canada supports, this above all therefore make, because the brutal position of the gold mine refuses them. 
This public and to appreciate, however on the foundation of a civilise swap from arguments it prepare to listen to Barrick, and not in someone to frame, who a lot notice as gag complaint (in course of the public debate'a claim just now addressed Barrick gold at the authors from Noir Canada, in who they require from them, this term no longer use...). 
Except from the surrealen speech from sir Garver, the complaint gold a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the wahrheitsfindung, who are fundamentally for each democratic society from Barrick. 
She absolutely the right right, to quote and to discuss, who credibly sources over facts and of interpretations the basis the intellectual work bilden. 
If impossible impossible Canada in a country there, topics, who not the rich enterprises this world favours, who knows otherwise the then make? 
, If Barrick liked gold really a public and transparent debate cannot cannot she this one, while she succeeds the scientific standards, who use from the authors from Noir Canada. 
She has a right to reply. 
The academic environment, to who we belong to, for years knows, and to get and to solve conflicts debates disagreements in the grip. 
The disproportionate complaint from Barrick gold show distinctly, that no desire for a transparent debate has them, in contrast with that, what she pleads,. 
How this a loss for the university world, likewise for the public debate, and he gets rid time a, that the governments measures the, who this way of unjustified complaints to restrict.
