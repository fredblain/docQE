The psychology of the überbietens -- or we ready 
By auctions the buyers tilt it, more spend and to overestimate the Feilgebotene therefore. 
Neurologist and economy researcher of the university from N.Y there now succeeded, and apparently to discover the neurologisch-ökonomischen foundations this acquaintance irrational behavior. 
According to a publishing in" Science" study himself the men in a competition, about an auction on not knocked eBay, give and therefore ready, even prices to überhöhte pay. 
The researchers have tried to acknowledge the neurologische diagram of this" game" with experimental auctions. 
A group of the volunteers shall shall lotto, while the other participated in a playful action-- in two falls the active brain areas of the pro bands were examined by means of functional magnetic repercussion( fMRI). 
By two games cannot the participants money, however an increasing activity the Striatum sised, by who a comes the überbieten of the rival into play. 
Next to many other functions this brain area the nervous system for the" Selbstbelohnung" responsible. 
The researchers from then on meant, the price increase explain left an Überreaktion of the Striatums with himself through the prevention. 
Around her thesis to support, the economists inquiries the money in the researcher group additional to Nachverfolgung hired. 
In this fall shall mitbieten three groups against a partner under distinct conditions. 
The test group the true value the product informed, then they have made her commitment. 
Promised 15 dollar reward over hinaus an other group, for the fall, that they result as winner from the game. 
The third group got 15 dollar before the auction, who equally a lost game in fall lost. 
The difference between two groups then consisted in exclusively inside, that the accentuation by who an on the gewinnen, while found by the other on that loss. 
As proof of who from neurologists of expressing hypothesis however the members the spielenden" against the loss" group too high commitments ready, when this one the" profit"- in the Kontroll-- respectively. group. 
"These results give up from no early economy theory to evacuate. 
This one namely up to now the watching by auctions behaviour ways the risk prevention only with the joy over the gewinnen, respectively. found. 
The contradiction between these two theories been thanks to the bildgebenden neurologischen processes, so that now have we a third explanation ready"-- Andrew meant ballast, professor of the economy faculty of the university from N.Y.
