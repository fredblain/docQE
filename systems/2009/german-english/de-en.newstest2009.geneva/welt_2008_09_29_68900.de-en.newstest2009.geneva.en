Dark matter influences flight from space probes 
Since years a mysterious phenomenon by forschen attends to disarray: Dark matter influences the speed from space probes during thus so-called Swing-by-Manöver. 
To fear expert, that the general relativity theory Albert Einsteins cannot not all aright be. 
Almost the space probe of" Ulysses" flew through the space 18 years. 
Ways soon the cold death now threatens her of frozen fuel directions. 
Under scientists a mysterious phenomenon attends since years to confusion-- the Swing-by-Anomalie. 
The Swing-by a flight manoeuvre from space probes, they additional momentum a sky body in Gravitationsfeld of, about the land, get. 
Thereby the probes can abolish many fuel. 
The American probe of Cassini-Huygens take likewise as the probe of Ulysses hold this physical trick. 
What the researchers however already surprise in addition to since years: The flight bodies do not thus, as one wait for him after the altehrwürdigen Gravitationsgesetz behave 100-prozentig. 
Rather it comes to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes get unexpected or slowly fast. 
Up to now the physicists cannot not explain this effect. 
They baptised him Swing-by-Anomalie. 
To fear some experts, that perhaps even the general relativity theory Albert Einsteins, who the magnetism the space from matter through a curvature describe, not all accurate to be. 
Who Advanced Study believes American physicists Stephen eagles of institute for out of Princeton after as before party daran, that Einstein not makes mistake, and try the Swing-by-Anomalie to explain cooperation of the so-called dark matter, the astronomers in universe continued. 
"Responsible for the anomaly dark matter being knew, who himself also all nearby to seal", he writes. 
From the existence of the dark matter the space researchers only know since about ten years. 
From she a magnetism visibly leaves for, who effect let watch himself on other sky body. 
They selber is on the other hand absolutely invisible, that calls, she sends and reflect no elektromagnetische radiation, in particular rightly also no visible light. 
After the calculations of the scientists a fünftel of the total measures of the universe all the same continues well the dark matter.
