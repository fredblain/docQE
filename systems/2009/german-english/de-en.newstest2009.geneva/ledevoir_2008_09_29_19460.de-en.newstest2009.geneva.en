Letter -- a disgracing country 
Sir Vic Toews, ex-'justice'- of minister( what irony) in cabinet Harper there was, who himself last summers authorized, over Louise Arbour say, she is a shame 'for Canada. 
This woman, who a liking struggle for the justice led and universe our admiration our have, thus with shame to roof, say likewise many over the person in order around the primeminister out of, as even over Stephen Parker. 
We here to make, who not at home he all the affected countries her caught in concentration camp compatriot with a government as single end caught up. 
A government, who not even take into account, that an adolescent was still Omar Khadr, as the things dispensed, who be to reproach to him. 
The single government, who signs in spite of the fact, that Canada the genfer convention, her word child soldier under inhuman conditions and breaks dahinvegetieren someone let. 
The single, what himself to a justice parody, to evaluate around the mistake of the defendant does stoop. 
We call us in memory, that UNICEF above all in contrast pleads, Amnesty International and who unification of the Canadian lawyers, at home Omar Khadr to catch up, in order he gets a fair lawsuit in Canada. 
Exactly this government also closes the eyes before the torture: He little interests them, that have will broken safely an young adult the torment after thus many years for always moral. 
We we we what still not knowingly, but we here live just now a treacherous circumcision of our law, our freedom and of our democracy', this word, what continuously Harper like a flag before himself her, and that out of his mouth thus trivial ring instruct. 
He then been the time, in who there are more no moral: One a Canadian bourgeois arbitrarily a,, all after Gutd√ºnken of an head of government, who only from the minority am supported until today( he likes all belong after that of 14. October to minority...) by the minority. 
Many electors believe to find her salvation by a party, the virtue. However they do not see that this government have dissociated from that, what the dignity of our country and continued the reputation. 
Who and nowhere differently shame, sir Toews, finds Lossagung in this one,.
