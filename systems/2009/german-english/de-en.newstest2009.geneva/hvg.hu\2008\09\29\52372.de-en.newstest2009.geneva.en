What produce amp in the bill factory from supplement&; Co.? 
At 8. October the negotiations in punishment lawsuit against János begin and supplement his accomplice. 
The defendants and in particular the participation other reprehensible actions at the organized criminality, as careless damage and business deceit rough, -- inter alia document forgery-- reproached. 
According to public prosecutor been the lukrierten out of the invitations of tenders means for own goals, while the provided performances often with gefälschten bills justify. 
National money and of grant from the selfmanagement-- over all clog of 65 million-- partially the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, part in the cash desks in the cash desks single flowed. 
, As the survey authorities gave known been imaginary bills by beziehen of the invitation money, and the associations her obligation shall no longer followed. 
According to written work a bulk of the bills shall gotten gefälscht. 
The bill blocks were bought at market by Józsefváros, who one make gave up in Kiskunhalas round marks. 
The decision above, on who what enterprises be to show bills, north resolutely on that tour of flattened lake from János supplement skilfully. 
In train of this" exploration excursion" Lados shall make ausfindig pension and of restaurant. 
He called for bills over the Konsumationen, around late on these plans resting bills for that youth -- and sport ministry, the Sozial -- and work ministry, as the selfmanagement from Budapest shows to knowhow. 
These bills majority from István Lados and his accomplice of, András rigged ri, am lasts the corresponding reports after our information for the constitution competent. 
A the goal from Lados'" exploration excursion" was a beer local. 
Shown in year of 2003 to take bills, quota of the gastronomy enterprise the neunzigköpfige group of the association of Biztos Pont Egyesület serves credit. 
Now the leader of the enterprise however boasts, a so much tall group did not once carry in the local adapted. 
An other bill, shown in summer of 2002 on the endowment Jöv pegs ért away, later on acknowledged a as Együtt Harmadik Évezredért, allocated equally grave form-- and content mistakes on. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, arranges exclusively over three rooms and of not more than ten persons simultaneously accommodate, guests shall stayed according to bill of 130. 
The imagination of the bill forgers were apparently put likewise no borders on, as he in order the Pigal Kft. went, and ért an gastronomy enterprise, in what accounting pegs supports of the customers away Jöv Hoppá according to accusation authority not first shine good. 
As z managers Gy Farkas who hvg.hu did that he was a matter around gefälschte documents, when he was subjected to the public prosecutor during a crossexamination by supports inform, he was clearly at once,. 
"Our enterprise name and the tax number were opportunely on the tampon wrong". 
And weiter: Except from technicalities also wrong wrong the fact, that shall the enterprise of 100 persons, after they over all eleven rooms credit, who thus many persons place bieten impossible. 
Also been food on the bill, on top of that no longer the restaurant since long time in. 
The attentive bill forgers have also verabsäumt, to check, that the took from they in eyeshade Budapester travel agency rice exclusive in stranger offer, and so they Hungary rice on the payment bill boasted, what the Rechnungslegungspraxis the enterprise contradicting contradicted. 
, As got in train of the surveys known moreover also had they the value-added tax on the bills, although agency performances, who himself on a country out of the EU bear, tax free. 
The altitude of the value-added tax was over all on four of hotel Révfülöp Kft. at the endowment Jöv making ért out bill pegs away wrong, since the enterprise instead of 25 only 15 percent MwSt. makes mistake, moreover mechanical bills are shown exclusively by the collaborators, who forge documents however handwritten. 
A large mistake, who to turn the" Rechnungslegern" was, the was, that had had they" merchandise oil sport" than performance provided in a fall, although not this offers from the spezialisierten on investment consultation enterprise, the public prosecutor informed. 
Large technicalities-- wrong bill format, of wrong tampons-- were to owe, that who a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as at XXI. at Együtt Shown bills when forgeries are unmasked knew. 
Likewise in fall of the Ravenna Bt. and the sport warehouse Kunfehértó, who manager asservated, who bills never shown. 
An other" mistake" is the forgers by the HIB Kft. out of Nyíregyháza turn: This society namely just now sealed to the time( 2001) in resolution, when there eaten the group the Fiatal Városért Egyesület-- the mass administrator boasted consequently, who bills not even shown. 
gefälscht knowingly 
The other group of the Rechnungsleger persons, absolutely aware who who, that they mustn't put imaginary bills on on. 
On request of the Fiatal Baloldal-- Ifjú Szocialisták a the endowment Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills Harmadik Évezredért for the endowment Együtt, in an altitude from about clog of 4 million. shown. 
According to written work the managers the Collab Kft. from a the defendant, Ludovic Györfi, to exhibition of the imaginary of bill persuade. 
Who equally momentary in Liquidation situated Biogate Kft. also and Co with supplement. teamed up: In year of 2003 the GmbH the endowment Jöv pegs ért away Alapítvány, as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny Egyesület million with gefälschten bills in total value from clog of 5. handled, who himself on not provided performances reported. 
There however gave likewise few payment traffic, since the bills were canceled directly after their exhibition, what the affected however forgotten in her support mark down. 
Who the third group of the Rechnungsleger consists of persons, be to bring directly with the defendants in connection. 
A from they Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager of the delta Trió Kft., an in Budapest established, there however not auffindbaren fuel-- and vehicle business enterprise. 
This enterprise shall about rescued 18 million in period of time until Dec of 2005 from several bills over the sale from EDV-Komponenten in value from clog. 
According to survey authority the situated since the 14. Sep of 2005 in Liquidation Cash investment Kft. out of Kiskunhalas when buyers of these bills have acted. 
A Romanian, what shall equally the enterprise documents from Iván Kubatov, between 2002 was and 2005 managers of this enterprise 
After our information had Kubatov during the surveys of, bills on behalf of the GmbH. at the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány at Együtt shown and who equivalent even cashed. 
The enterprises Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as the Jos-Investment Bt. shall founded be from Romanian builder on Iván Kubatovs formal desire. 
In however no this enterprise was actively, what was according to defendant at deficient missions. 
However he cannot profit from the enterprises: On request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who charge with the preparation of the enterprise foundation supports, he shown bills on behalf of the enterprises at the brought with supplement in connection associations, as about at Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Over all Kubatov 15 bills the enterprises Cash investment, delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos in total value from clog of 14,2 million in name, Jos investment and of Linaxtrade at the organisations shown. 
The public prosecutor leaves from it for, that cash each time Kubatov 10% the bill sums as well as the value-added tax. 
Kubatov even the enterprise Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of imaginary bills abuse credit -- in this fall the bills the applications from Biztos Pont joined. 
Who a enterprise Y-Generáció and Szövetség rot Magyarországért in Jan of 2006 her application by the gemeinnützigen organisation of the socialist party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (" TMA") put back. 
Both got Forint, these amounts have however profited zweckentfremdet. per 500.000 
Around this to hide, they the TMA five imaginary bills the Works team Kft. subjected. 
These bills moreover the office by the durchsuchung from Árpád Kemecsei in teaching ministry provided. 
By the negotiations now the bill forgery, they were already withdrawn before the public prosecutor from some defendants with an admission over the procedure, reckoned. 
A sensation cannot cannot, if the Hauptangeklagte János supplement resolves to a detailed admission. 
His former indication was namely fewer detailed, and although he had already time and again recited, consisting over all to bring back, still support his admission. 
The question then stays open, whether this in his interest in, whether the socialists a pact the bulk the born damage with he concerning the mending from clog of 50 million. closed, and whether supplement in riposte ready, who responsibility to assume. 
However possible possible absolutely, that supplement now trifles with the" offended", after his request the imprisonment and house stop on softening on deaf ears wheeled. 
While other Kriminelle, who far away tall damage with economy crimes caused and this not paid, on free foot, or at least under house stop stay, this possibility have left supplement verwehrt.
