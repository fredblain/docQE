You are what you on you mitteilst 
At its tenth birthday of Google can safely say: it is in the pockets of the people in the same way to find on their heads, as the sky: you know, where people have spent their holiday specialist, for what they are going, and what they move. 
And not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the chief executive officer of Google. 
In the direction of sceptics who are beset by Orwellian nightmare visions, he is very: they would host the essence of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google is even more personal data on the user to collect and so the original objective to get closer to the company, which states that "all information" wants to sort out of this world. 
Schmidt said Google is after ten years weltver채ndernder work is still only at the beginning of the information collection. 
Asked after the status quo in five years, said Schmidt: he would like to Google would be able to questions like "what can I do tomorrow?" or "what job really fits me?" to answer, however, software programmes are not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. 
Not all internet-user are aware that, in the context of their Internet searching the Suchbegriffe were registered, as well as the IP addresses, from where sought, and the visited pages. 
The two years ago, for example, Personalized Search '' introduced its own Suchverlauf allows the visitors to resort to store and later so that the hit later can be generated a lot more precise, based on the same logic and also the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system of tailored products and services as a result of the previous preferences recommends. 
The user issues, though, is what is happening in the event of Datenmissbrauchs - "if you check what I make", are some concerned whether the Google data monopoly. 
In most cases, however, it is rather represented by the firm, potential power, the terrifying effect, and less the guilt or the fear of punishment, the quest for freedom or the rebellion against the power, with many internet-usern turn against it. 
However, it is a proven fact that the Suchbegriffe not only stored, but also in the character will be passed on to third parties, and in this legislative cases there is no protection for the rights of the internet-users. 
A perfect example was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, as part of its Google gave the Brazilian government information by the Gemeinschaftssite Orkut name '' have been collected and also a identification of P채dophilien. 
A personal rights worried users have been able to breathe a sigh of relief, but even in May than Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against the FBI to Court: that can Google also in future with no area of the Constitution be forced the FBI information to a secret question. 
(However, the Federal Government has successfully the publication of 50,000 Suchbegriffen Webadressen and 1000 years ago with reference to the minors act passed, but it was obtained from the list of individual users, or the two months Suchbegriffsliste Web- and retroactively.) 
So Google's image remains a contentious issue: those who are reluctant to their personal data because they are classified by the use of the google- services the loss of their private and privacy are afraid that plagues the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. 
However, the American 'geek-kultur ", which is present in many countries, and enthusiastic Computerfans unites activists and youth, the next generation of" coolen entrepreneurs "in you, unlike Microsoft windows, is market leader, even if both at the same goal. 
A reason for this is that Google its users, in contrast to Microsoft, and no Identifizierungscodes demands of its services available for free, and that a more open, constantly updated far more attractive package used and new, young people and appear to be cooler than the official practices of the software giant. 
The Geeks, on the other hand, suggested the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet knife sharply - a relationship, particularly in the past few years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" in focus. 
The "Web 2.0" is nothing other than about collaboration, in other words, users have left deliberately traces and is the use of available channels of communication, and even if the proportions of individually are different, the main remains the same --- to show themselves in public. 
At the same time, to an average of young people can be managing several Community gateways, from Facebook profile of Xanga, this through other services, such as Twitter, or Musikdienste like last. FM, and can combine all this in a follow-up system such as friendfeed or blip. FM. In addition, blogs, which you can represent the latest Fotogalerien automatically on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a number of other classic cases shows: looking at the Partyfotos last night, the friend soon, with whom she has untreuer friend vergn체gt, or the staff will be dismissed, because he was in his blog only too honest his anger on the management of the air force, one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been interpreted completely new. 
Who leads a online-leben is what he preisgibt - by itself could be so in around the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's young people. 
And anyone who tries anything to keep secret, or even to circumvent the google- monopoly, that can be happy to do so - such as those with Scroogle, a Tool, which is on the search engine of Google zugreift, but deliberately no trail. 
Not a few people choose not to register on Community parties, so that they are not be setting ever-higher standards, but also the online applications, such as by Google and Textverarbeitungs- rss-feeds grafische tools and can deal with alternative versions, which are tied to no huge Serverparks and therefore not the best possible profiles of users it. 
However, public opinion is waiting to overcome by Google, its true face shows. 
With their current value of about $156 billion, the company even before IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), from Werbefl채chen adwords / adsense threaten the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the ever faster imported services are preparing not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical observer, however, find the disturbing Gegenpole: for example, the company has led a protest by the staff completely dismissed the charges, after the company's children garden doubled, also said the management of the frequent meals of staff is too costly. All this sounds but quite mild against the fact that Google in 2006 even before the Chinese Government to its knees, and with an agreement was critical hits, for all the regime, or those who are against the good taste, were extracted. 
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service advertised in advance, but only if they could already is available. However, the events of the next few months and years back some strong department: while some believe Google's Buch- and Magazinscan- or archiving project now take proportions that the company soon with the Supreme Court should address other rather, it is because of the system "health" concerned that the creation of a complete health profile on the basis of convicted, doctors and problems. 
And the fact that Google provides a genetic database, building the next generation of sci-fi writers already the substance, about '' the famous Scroogled Cory Doctorow novel with the best of Orwellian fashion describes a future in which one person thanks of Google nahbar frighteningly personal data.
