Influences flight of dark matter Raumsonden 
For years in a bathing mysteriöses phenomenon to search for doom: dark matter influences the speed of Raumsonden during so-called swing-by-manöver. 
Experts are worried that the Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity seems not quite right could be. 
Almost 18 years was flying the spacecraft went '' Ulysses' 'through the space. 
Because soon gefrierenden fuel lines, it is in danger of Kältetod now. 
Among scientists for years mysteriöses provides a phenomenon for confusion - the swing-by-anomalie. 
This is a Flugmanöver Swing-by of Raumsonden, during which they lent a heaven's body in the Gravitationsfeld, around the world. 
By the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The Euro-American Forschungssonde cassini-huygens used these physical trick as well as the Ulysses Sonnensonde. 
What the researchers, however, has for years been surprised: the missiles do not behave totally as one would expect after the ancient Gravitationsgesetz. 
It is irregularities in the speed. 
The probes will speed up or slow down unexpectedly. 
So far this effect could not explain the physicist. 
They swing-by-anomalie tauften him. 
Some experts fear that may even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity seems the attraction of matter by a curvature of the area describes not quite right could be. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle from the Institute for use study from Princeton remains firmly believes that Einstein, and not wrongly tried the swing-by-anomalie through the so-called dark matter to explain the Astronomen accounted for in the universe. 
"responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which is also very near the earth could decide," he says. 
About the existence of the dark matter know the space researchers only for over 10 years. 
It is clearly a magnet for whose effects on other heaven's body is. 
They themselves, however, is totally invisible, that is, it sends out and reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists makes the dark matter after all good one fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
