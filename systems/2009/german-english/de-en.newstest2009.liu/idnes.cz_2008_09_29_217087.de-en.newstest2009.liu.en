The first virtual providers is already in this year after the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite perfect, the Czech providers offer virtually all services as their counterparts in Western Europe. 
However, something is missing here - a virtual service providers, the forces the classic at lower prices. 
Perhaps this will not be long in coming. 
The Czech mobile phone suppliers to the highest in Europe at all work, we have also often reported at mobile. Cz. 
It also confirmed the telecommunications authority tú, the attention that the price of a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. 
After recent moves by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, it is probably to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators will be cheaper SMS from abroad than at home. 
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe are so high? 
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a declaration of war. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic, there are three network and a Penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone providers like against grumbling about the fact that it very much on the Czech market competition. 
The agrees with often the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (tú) by Pavel dvoák, often in the past, said that it had no place in the Czech Republic for another provider. 
It is likely that a classic with a own network providers not so many opportunities (incidentally, he would probably find little of frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility - a virtual providers. 
The entry of virtual providers on the mobile market brought a strong price reduction, in which the traditional mobile phone operators had to respond. 
There was even before the advent of such companies such as Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile on the market in the United Kingdom similar votes as in the Czech Republic. 
However, it turns out that there is a place for such providers and that they can really be successful. 
Not long after, by the way, you need to seek examples. 
In February that we have on the start of the virtual operator reported Mobilking in Poland. 
In just half a year, this providers, more than 100 thousand customers and so on to win fünfgrößten providers in the country levels. 
It is behind Mobilking Penta, the financial group in the Czech Republic, among other things, U: fon. 
The advantage of virtual providers is that we focus on a much more specific target group. 
In order to be able to function effectively virtual providers need much less customers: as a classic providers. 
They need no relatively high cost of construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world as protectors normally the virtual operators as low-cost- firms on the other, they offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS, although often of a less extensive service. 
That is, for example, Tesco mobile in the United Kingdom SMS at least half to cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move, in a not klischeehafte target group. 
This providers: specifically directed to men. 
"real Kerle Mobilking - the providers, choose who you like and they can trust", so David Seibert, the chief executive of the mobile entertainment company, the company this virtual prey. 
Hard to tell whether a similar plan in Poland also could get a foothold in the Czech Republic. 
Doubts the press spokesman of Vodafone Miroslav epický: "the Czech market is for a market share, in the most virtual operators based on relatively small. 
He is also in the view of the services offer relatively saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic, the mobile phone operators, not my 
But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile phone operators, this is not Mobilking conquered the Czech Republic. 
"We talk about an expansion of this successful project in the Czech Republic, but the negotiations are not very hopeful. 
It is more likely to produce a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region ", says in a phone call for mobile. Cz, press spokeswoman Jana studniková Penta, the financial group. 
Indirectly confirmed it so that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are not well disposed towards this idea. 
The opposite, they are attempting to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor. 
Their interest in a start of a virtual mobile phone operator already shows the group for some time, Novera gts would like to do the one step further, to a real competitor by Telefónica O2 customers in the area firms. 
"We have a great interest in our customers not only both fixed, but also mobile telephone telecommunications service providers. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have repeatedly about that possibility negotiated with all the Czech mobile operators. 
With some of them, we were able to achieve progress in the negotiations ", so the press spokesman for the group by Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now come better times. 
From not official information suggests that the first virtual operators by the end of the year, perhaps, is to be expected. 
So far, but this is an insurmountable wall of silence. 
"at the moment, we do not imagine that in the Czech Republic square for a full-fledged virtual providers. 
The Czech market compared to other markets has great specifics. 
So far, we still have no subject with a complex and serious project in this area, "says said in its statement for mobile. Cz Vlastimil LRRD from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
On the nature of the Czech market also reject other providers. 
The press spokeswoman of presenting historian Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement by O2 added: "so far we have no viable and mutually advantageous project, found on which one could continue to build." 
And it adds: "in the network of presenting until the end of the year is hardly a virtual providers appear. 
In this moment, we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think at such short notice. " 
Vodafone is his attention more to comply with the requirements of the own 3g-lizenz. 
Miroslav epický thinks this: "for negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the field division of cost and infrastructure. 
This is exactly what we see in the view of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in search of a partner in the development of a shared network for a rapid mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities, hand in hand with the providers 
The actions of the mobile phone operators is easy to understand another provider more competition, this would mean to lower prices and will also lead to a decline in profits. 
So why one should make it easier for such competitors from entering the market? 
The providers can pull together when it comes to something is also shown by the long bounced back and forth about the generation of U: fon. 
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of tú was at the time, as U: fon came on the market for presenting, by society. 
It also confirm the publicly accessible information from the tú-webseiten. 
But is just now U: fon as an argument why we should not allow a virtual operators. 
Historian Martina Kemrová said: "the competition environment of the mobile telephony market was also recently by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider. 
In light of the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is evident that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services would be tough demands. " 
In light of this approach of the mobile phone operators, however, surprised by the absolute indifference of the Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is the attitude of the tú in Czech, sadly, in contrast to Britain and other developed countries - not is competent to intervene in the economic competition. 
This is solely the Office for the protection of the economic competition (úohs). 
This but referred to this issue as a whole, its very typical attitude. 
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after it to a contract between a mobile phone operators and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
No such Treaty has so far been closed, as the supply of potential stakeholders for the traditional operators probably was not sufficiently interesting ", so in his response to our request by the Department Kristián Chalupa úohs foreign relations. 
By representatives of the supplier would not be surprised by such a formulation. 
From one office to represent the interests of the consumer, among other things, to ensure that no one is abused his position in the market, this is more than worrying. 
In particular, adding: "If Kristián Chalupa abroad, where virtual operators work quite normal to see their market entry to a price cuts for mobile telephone services has helped." 
But are probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction not with the interests of the úohs. 
Really shocking is in this case the almost touching line of the three mobile phone operators, based on their reactions. 
The question of whether it was a coincidence, is obvious. 
As well as the absolutely same price for petrol stations certainly only by chance and the result of a tough competition. 
"the authority has discovered no evidence on this issue, for a resolute action against the competition, and therefore suggest that it has no reason, in any way, to intervene in the matter. 
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so it has also not conducting increased responsibility for his actions on the market. 
The instruments necessary for the opening up of the mobile phone market for virtual providers lack probably also the regulatory authority for telecommunications, led Chalupa in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points. 
There are, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drafted by the tú, after the telecommunications, from the point of view of economic competition a single market. 
On such a market has, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators holds a dominating position. 
Some legal experts, however, offer a different perspective - for access to the market of a virtual supplier has always required the approval of the devised. 
And the mobile phone providers - logically - for his network the monopoly. 
The means that they are in a certain segment will require a dominant position. 
Even if it refuses to play ball with this argument but not for the úohs, it should be a warning that at least three mobile phone operators strikingly similar approach. 
This show complaints of a number of interested parties (including the society Novera gts) that they are in negotiations with all providers on very similar obstacles. 
Buck-passing in the tú is in the telecommunications services a right of common trick with the úohs to distance itself from the whole affair. 
It was already in a number of similar cases. 
It is, unfortunately, not achieved in the recently reviewing of the telecommunications law adopted the enlargement of the powers of the tú on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts from promised an improvement in the situation. 
The, the representatives of úohs know only too well, but you have probably other interests. 
It is already, if nobody watching 
Unappreciated, once the functioning of any pseudo virtual operators, of which there in the Czech mobile networks equal several. 
There are companies which own price lists for mobile telecom services, but they spend only partly made public. 
Normally is, after all, the companies that operate in the area of multilevel-marketing. 
Offer their own mobile telephone services, for example, Amway Starlife Bohemia, telecom and others. 
The price lists of these companies usually only reach to select. 
The joke of the matter is that the firm towards the operator as classic Firmenkunde appearance, a lot of SIM cards. 
He then as important customer receives special offers of prices (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators continue to sell a similar ban. 
"If there are some cases which describe them, then it is a violation of contractual conditions, which we will deal, which put an end to the cooperation with the relevant society," said historian Martina Kemrová to our question on this issue. 
However, it is unlikely that something with the leaders of the mobile phone operators not gets about. 
Particularly in the case of the three mentioned companies can act to thousands of customers. 
No operator, however, is opposed to such an approach. 
Flow from the work of these companies that they are not negligible gains, you will at the same time - in contrast to the real virtual suppliers - not by the real official marketing. 
On possible problems Miroslav epický closely: "the law allows these types of speculation, despite all the services provided by the firms are only a very small percentage of customers use. 
This must also accept that the sim-karte in their telephone not on their behalf, so you can have not used as the normal customer of the mobile phone providers. " 
The alone, however, the tú at least strange. 
Also gives another question for the úohs. 
The mobile phone operators shut their eyes before such an approach, why do you lock themselves against a virtual providers? 
It is to add that the úohs to uncover such activities have fairly strong powers, and if they do not want, it must, not with the declaration of providers that they knew nothing about it and its business conditions would be content to forbid it. 
When the Czech Republic is no longer in the most expensive 
As the text said on a number of occasions, the market entry was a sharp price drop virtual operators in the various services. 
They have practically in all countries, where virtual operators were created, the traditional providers, which is trying to prevent virtually, more or less. 
You practically identical arguments were used - is too small, or very gesättigter market, problems in the quality of services, etc. 
In the highly developed countries in these moments but blew the regulatory bodies, which is far from the interests of the mobile service providers, but the their customers tried to maintain. 
Either by formal measures or not formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by further. 
Unfortunately raise the Czech regulatory bodies to the whole event, like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience we can not help rid that ambiguity in the powers in these cases is more than favourable. 
But let us not give up so easily. 
If the background information is correct and soon a virtual providers, will the Czech mobile market moving again soon, perhaps. 
If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual mobile phone provider, it will not remain inactive, úohs when it comes to reject other interested parties (to discriminate against them). 
And the Czechs will no longer use more expensive than the rest of Europe.
